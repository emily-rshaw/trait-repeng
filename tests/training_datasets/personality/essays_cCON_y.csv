Tell me about yourself.,"An open keyboard and buttons to push. The thing finally worked and I need not use periods, commas and all those thinks. Double space after a period. We can't help it. I put spaces between my words and I do my happy little assignment of jibber-jabber. Babble babble babble for 20 relaxing minutes and I feel silly and grammatically incorrect. I am linked to an unknown reader. A graduate student with an absurd job. I type. I jabber and I think about dinoflagellates. About sunflower crosses and about the fiberglass that has be added to my lips via clove cigarettes and I think about things that I shouldn't be thinking. I know I shouldn't be thinking. or writing let's say/  So I don't. Thoughts don't solidify. They lodge in the back. behind my tongue maybe. Somewhere at the point of hiding but   dinoflaghelates, protistas and what was that sea weed. I think about the San Luiz valley and I think about the mushrooms in cow shit. I think about the ticos and I think about the chiggers that are living in my legs. I itch. I coat myself with clear nail polish in hopes to suffocate the bugs that are living in my legs and I remember Marco. I remember Ecuador  and I think about my thoughts and what I am not supposed to be doing in this assignment. Thoughts. I wonder if I think in sentences I wonder what affect my slowish typing has on my stream of consciousness and I wonder if there is a way that typing speed can be measured in this study  so that so link some generalization of dorky 301 psyc students. green and the table in my kitchen makes me want to vomit. orange. What an absurd color. wish I wasn't in the united state. My greencard runs out in a few years wonder what I do. I hope Dr. Linder gets back in his lab because I really need to find out if he has funds to pay me. May have to go back to the library. Brainless job of nothingness that would make me wallow in the world of boredom which isn't entirely bad. Need to focus on school organics and such. Period. Two spaces after the period. Mistakes and I want to eat not hungry and I wonder how many people talk about food in there little computer ramblings  Feel open and Happy that I am not having to edit this. Type type I don't know what I am think Hannah Imi and Osdprey house. I remember when I went down to that . she had spiders on hurt wall pain all over the place and we painted clouds on the ceiling and the blue walls were so obnoxious. Carey. Sex sex sex. yeah. This is a strange assignment and Portonoy's complaint is ringing in my head. Eager to finish so that I can start for Whom the Bell Tolls and get on with it. Bio and Carbon atoms bonds and orbitals. Thinking  about the electron configuration that surrounds the last letter in my first name and I think that I must have been granted a full ""s"" orbital  one up and one down. spinning on opposite directions and I am thinking about Scottish poetry about Mike in his kilt and about my guitar that I am slowly slowly slowly learning to play. I wonder what goes on in this study. I wonder if those happy little bored entertained grad students will scan words and I wonder how I can mess up this study? Random words like . don't know. ;Me me me me me and I wish that some things were easier and I wish that I had been keeping my eye on the clock. Wondering how long I have been typing and wishing that I was finished because I need to find out if I have to / will work in the Botany lab again and all that . ILS Belly and the Flamenco. Bjork and Rozamond Cockrill kickin' it in Saratoga Springs. I hate Molly's cat and wish that it could be exchanged for a worthwhile ferret. Type type type. I have managed to waste over 20 minutes of time I think. Who knows. What If I was to write this out and it took 30 minutes to write and 15 minutes to type. Thinking about nothing and wishing that some financial aid would come my way. Need a job and a sprinkling of time. Time to go and sign outta here. trees "
Tell me about yourself.,"I can't believe it!  It's really happening!  My pulse is racing like mad. So this is what it's like. now I finally know what it feels like. just a few more steps. I wonder if he is going to get any sleep tonight!?  I sure won't!  Well, of course I have a million deadlines to meet tomorrow so I'll be up late anyway. But OH! I'm so so excited!  Yes!  Yes!  I can't believe it is finally happening. Wait! Calm down. We aren't officially a couple yet. What if I end up not liking him?  That would be horrible. Oh great, I wonder how long it'll take me to finish those Calculus problems?  I'll get it done. Don't you always, Amy?  I can't believe Bob did it!  He really did it!  He is THE miracle worker. If things turn out all right I will owe him more than I can ever repay. I wonder what Steve is doing in Malaysia right now?  An entire month!  I'll likely clean out his refrigerator by then. Omigosh!  Food, lunch tomorrow, what will I ever say to him?  He is perfect in every way imaginable. It is so important for him to think of me the same way. well, maybe not Perfect, but certainly dynamic. Who would have ever thought!  Good things do indeed come to those who wait!  Oh, I'll have to remember to sign the poster he made tomorrow morning. I hope Steve's alarm clock is reliable and I don't oversleep. That would be tragic if I slept 'til noon and missed the lunch. Thank goodness Portia is coming along. I will definitely need her support as well as Bob's. just having her there will take away some of the tension and put me more at ease. I'll have to rehearse what I say beforehand. things can only get better from here, right? hopefully. oh, I'm so nervous!  He will be too. maybe even more so. it'll be ok. Why in the world do humans put themselves through such torture. maybe love is really worth it?    "
Tell me about yourself.,"The RTF305 Usenet site is a piece of garbage!  I just sent my first required message, only to have another person's name in the From slot!  Now I probably won't get credit, and worse yet, I can't access it again!  The computers here suck!  It's bad enough I wait in line just to use one. Well, that's it, I have  got to get my own. Or perhaps, bring my old one from home. It seems different, even though basically everything is the same. It's on my desk at home right now. That antique desk where I spent hour after hour perfecting my work,  listening to my favorite music right now. I hear Journey, and String right now, now if that stereo down the hall would shut up!  What are they paying  for anyway?  They come miles upon miles, after earning the right to be here, and then squander it on stupid sound effects, and loud music. If I wanted to hear Inspector Gadget during the Simpsons, I would change the channel!  I only get to watch t. v. for 30 minutes or so a day, and I certainly want to choose, and if my roommate and I don't choose, why should that inconsiderate shmuck down the hall get to!?  Speaking of halls, that turn was so tight in the one off of my computer room. I used to feel plush carpet under my feet, and the cold, refreshing taste of Coke when I walked quickly into the room to begin my work for the night. And all those shows that I missed! I missed countless mindless hours of television. Pure, mind-numbing entertainment, what can beat that. I see industrial carpet on the wall right now. How plush my bed was!  Jake used to love when I gave him nip, or scratched his ears at night. It reminds me of when that  bumpkin exterminator came to the large, clean, inviting house thought he was a bob cat. So the vet called him ""big-boned"", that doesnt mean he was obese. So he ate 3 bowls a day, and was a 20 pound cat with a gut. That reminds me of ""Cats"" when the twenty pounder is the human equivalent of 300 or so pounds. That theatre rocked. I. M. Pei is awesome, but that other guy on t. v. is an eccentric freak. The Myerson is cool, I could go for some more hot chocolate now, just like during the Christmas musical we went to. That guy was pretty short who my mom worked with, and bald as a bowling alley floor. I have to play pool before I go insane!  That basement used to smell musty, but the sleepovers were fun.  "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm really unsure about this assignment because I'm afraid I won/t be able to think of things to say for 20 minutes so I'll start off with why I'm so mad right now. last night Allison, Rebecca, and Stephanie and I went with Paul and trey to go coon hunting because Allison and I went with them last weekend and it was fun, so anyway we drove for an hour to get to Killeen over this bridge that they hang prostitutes from no that was later first we went to this house that was so trashy that Rebecca didn't even want to go inside to use the bathroom so she went outside thats gross then we drove to the place for hunting and  they made us get in the bed of the truck and trey drove about 50 mph and we were flying all around we played this Ive never game I didn't realize that Rebecca and Stephanie are just like me thats cool so then we go over this bridge that smells like shit or rotting carcasses or something and we were so scared because Stephanie was telling a ghost story abo9ut a bridge and then trey turned around and we went over the bridge about 3 more times we were so scared then we get to the field and Paul was already being an asshole and they took the dogs out Allison had begun Paul had Jodi and trey had flip and they left the walker bitch spice in the truck so we start walking toward the creek which turned out to be raw sewage and I refused to go any further and Paul screamed at me that I was a bitch and he didn't give a fuck what I did so I went back through the woods with no flashlight so I could get in the truck I have never been more scarred in my entire life I prayed the whole time and I took spice out because I was afraid that I was going to get raped and murdered or something I was bawling and trying to tell my parents through telepathy that I loved them and that I would miss them because I was going to die then I heard a voice yelling my name and asking for help it was trey he was coming back to make sure I was okay I was so happy then about  30 minutes later the others came back, they looked like night of the living dead with briars and thorns all in their hair they told me they wished they'd stayed with me then they got in their bras and panties because their clothes were soaked with sewage and we drove home the whole time Paul is bitching to Allison about everything and treating her like shit I think she could do so much better but she's in love and I told her that but we didnt get home until 4am and I had a 10 class that I've missed too much already but I made it and that has basically what has been consuming me today Im sorry if its not what you wanted. "
Tell me about yourself.,Today was a tough day for me. I can't believed I failed to talk to  Asweenee. No girl has ever had that much power on me. Its probably the sun kicking in. I can't wait to go to the football game on Saturday. UT  is definitely going to beat Rutgers b/c Rutgers lost last week to a weak team by more than 20 points. Calculus class is going to be boring tomorrow because the professor is going to continue his lecture on limits. I hope we get no homework or else I will be very busy Wed. night. That phone next door is driving me crazy! Why does Kyle have the ringer on so high? I need to buy the Bush CD soon. The songs on that CD will pump me up and let me overcome my fear of talking to Asweenee. I hope she remembers me from the concert and knows that I am not some weird freak. Neal seems to enjoy studying Chemistry for no reason because he does the extra problems even though they are not due at all. I guess he feels insecure about his ability in Chemistry. I hope the Giants win next week at Jacksonville. It should be a good game but knowing my luck they won't even televise that game. Who cares about the Cowboys?  Tonight I want to email Steve and tell him my difficult conquest for a girlfriend. Maybe things will clear up the next few days and I will finally have the courage to do what I am so good at: socializing. I have never froze up like this in a long time. Maybe I am thinking too much about screwing up. I know I am better than that. Baseball season is almost near the homestretch. I hope the Yankees can catch up to the Orioles and go back to the World Series. My parents are probably trying to call right now and are wondering why the phone line is busy. I wondering how Linh is adjusting at Rice?  I hope she is not getting too depressed about not seeing Paul because I am not there to help her get through this hard time. I am glad I was there for her this summer because she needed a good friend who could understand her. I really miss her a lot but at the same time I know she will be fine. I sound like her parents. I wonder how Craig's drive to Minnesota is?  His dad is probably giving him a lecture after what happened to him this summer. This room needs more AC. AC. The idiot next door is blaring his music. Spice girls suck!  If he is going to listen to music at least show some taste. I think I am starting to feel the effects of the Hunan chicken. That stuffed dog looks like Snoopy. Neal must be attached to this toy. 
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, I am sitting in the library right now, you know the one across from  Jester Center. I am hard at work trying to think of things and writing  them down as I go along. Oh, I just heard someone moving in  his seat making  a creaking noise. There he goes again. Why cant he this guy sit still. Boy am I sleepy, my neck has a cramp and there goes that guy again moving in  his in his seat. Oh, the fountain (I had to look up for this one) is making  noise. Okay. it stopped now. Boy am I tired. I wish I was sleeping right now. I can hear people walking in the distance and someone flipping through pages  in a book. I wonder what he is looking for. It is probably something for his  ultra tough class. Man, I am tired. Excuse me but I have to stop writing for  a second. Boy I really can not see anything without my glasses. My eyesight  must be really bad. Go figure, I have been wearing glasses since the 7th grade. I liked them at first and thought they were cool but I despise wearing glasses. It hurts my ears and gives me a headache  sometimes. Ah, just needed to pull  the chair in a little. Man, I wish someone was here to massage my neck and  shoulder, preferably a girl. This just can not get any worse, now I am  beginning to feel pain in my forearm from writing so much. I think I am really  out of shape for my forearm to be hurting so much. Wow, this is truly horrific,  everything around me is a blur. Man, if someone killed every one in this room  and I saw him. I would probably not be able to identify him or even describe  him to the police. Boy, my sight is so bad. Good, I only have about eight more  minutes of writing. I wish I can go to sleep right now, but no, I have to  finish this writing assignment. Man, does this mean I would have to type this  on the computer. Great, well I will be getting out of here real soon. Oh, I can  see much better now. What is with the neck cramp. Things could not get any  worse for me. Here I am sitting here and having to write for at least twenty  minutes on the stream of my conscience. My eyes are drooping and heavy, my  chest is in pain from the way I am sitting, and my right arm is so tired. Please stop! Dude, I have about three more minutes. Time sure flies by real  fast. Yeah right! Cool, that guy has an outline of a roadrunner on the back of  his shirt. Man, well is he not a little too noisy. I mean we are in the library,  man, and people are trying to do a writing assignment for psychology here, man. Dude, I just heard the door opened and shut. Alright, I can finally stop now. Hope you like it. That was twenty minutes of my life down the tube. Thanks a  lot. Just kidding. Ha! Ha! "
Tell me about yourself.,"sitting here just writing stuff down on paper. thinking about going out tonight. Im pretty happy because the navy paid me some more money. so there is money to go out with. Im doing this on paper hoping it's a little easier than just typing. time goes slow when you are waiting on it. that girl is really cute. I can not concentrate on one thing for that long of a time. there are people here talking which takes my attention. the football game tomorrow. Im not going. every body seems to be gung-ho about going. I don't see the big deal. watch it on tv who is lance corporal ruther. being late for pt would suck because they make you write about that stuff. thoughts are a weird thing everything you look at will bring on a thought the books, people everything they talk about will make you think a certain thing and it's not like you can ignore them when there in the same room. there's too much time for me to make up today. I can't do it. I wonder what they'll do. probably not much Ill have about three quarters of I so it shouldn't be a big deal. it's good that we have it but it should be open alot later than just 9 o'clock. extra study. the ROTC unit is good that way I guess I wonder how late I have to stay there today. it doesn't really matter I guess but I want to go out tonight this is my one night to go out and get drunk so I plan on doing it not real bad but some. people are trying to figure out there total hours. I need to but I doubt it'll help it's funny how people use there study hours. mostly trying to figure out little things to do. everything but study. I think that's time I hope this is close to what the assignment was. my mind is pretty simple so it's hard to write for that long about what it's doing. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     Well, I feel good about the fact that I am getting this assignment done  well before it is due. Today is one of those days that I feel really  motivated to do my homework, as opposed to those days in which I don't   do anything worthwhile. The excitement of college is starting to wear off and I think that the reality of the fact that I am here is finally sinking in. I really hate the way this typing field doesn't automatically move the sentence down to the next line! I really don't seem to be thinking about anything  interesting right now. I am just feeling average, not extremely excited or  unhappy. I really cannot think of anything to type. I think my mind is clearing  itself like it usually does when I sit down to right a paper. No stray thoughts seem to be coming to me. I am fairly excited about this psychology course. I think this course will not only be very interesting but helpful as well  because I plan to go into medicine. Boy, this twenty minutes is going by slowly. I think I might be typing too much too fast. Perhaps I am supposed to sit and wait till a thought comes to me before I type. I have tried to type in my current thoughts and feelings. My roommate is typing on his computer as well, annoying. Now he has turned on his fan, which is fairly loud . he switched it off. Still no  stray thoughts. I guess composing these sentences are thoughts. This assignment  is all I am thinking about right now. Four minutes to go. Three minutes to go. I have to go out and buy an answering machine today. I have to get back before nine  so I can make the upper East Jester floor meeting. Free pizza will be there! I hope its Double Dave's. Oh, they have good pepperoni rolls, I don't know about their pizza. Well, it has been 20 minutes.   "
Tell me about yourself.,"My neighbor from across the hall is letting me use her computer because she is online. I went to Kinsolving and the lab was closed, that stunk. I'm very tired because I did not get very much sleep last night. Some girls on my wing and I were going to go to some Frat parties, but we wound up staying in the dorm and watching movies. It turns out one of my roommates friends is also in this psy. class, I thought that was really neat, although the class is so huge, it doesn't surprise me. I haven't seen very many of my high school friends here at UT, I really didn't want to talk about college because that is the other assignment, but it seems to be the most foremost thing on my mind right now. The Cowboys are kicking off their season tomorrow at noon!!!  I worked for them for about nine months, so I am somewhat obligated to watch, that and the fact that my step-father has been a fan for 23 years or so. I was able to get him a bluebook autographed by Troy Aikman for Father's Day this year!  I really enjoyed giving that to him I love giving gifts, it's my most favorite thing to do!!!  I love to make people happy and some people think I'm crazy for that, but I think it's great. That's another reason I have enjoyed my intern ship with the Cowboys so much. When I get a letter about a sick child, my heart sinks and to know that sending something from the Cowboys will make them feel better or at least distract from the state they are in. Let's see 7 more minutes of writing. My roommate and I were talking about our special talents, I told her mine was finding holes in sidewalks!!  Yes, if I walk down Guadalupe, I WILL fall in every hole and look like a fool in front of at least 20 people that happen to be walking by!! That is something else, hey!! I just found out that my step-mom got a new car, and my dad bought her old one from her. This is a man who says he cannot send me $100 a month, but can take a two week vacation to South Dakota and buy a new car in the same month!! Anyway, that subject somewhat depresses me. ok 2 more minutes of writing, I can handle it, hey I'll bet you can tell I'm a slow typer now, can't ya!!! Well it sure has been great talking to you. And as our good friend TEX would say: Goodbye and good luck.     "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm feeling jealous right now. I got an email from one of my friends. She informed me that my x-girlfriend is now dating a new person. It makes me mad. I don't know why. I don't like her anymore. Oh, well, just forget it. I'm hot. maybe it has something to do with the recent news. I guess I just need to ""cool off"". I really like it here at UT. everybody is very nice. Im trying to think of what to type. Ive got this particular song in my head, and I can't get rid of it. it's aggravating. Im tired. I wish I could take a nap, but the dorms are to loud. wow, she's pretty. I wonder if she'll be my future wife. maybe, maybe not. I wonder if I should ask Emily to dinner tonight. I can't think of a way to ask her without making it sound like a date. I fear being rejected. I guess that's what pisses me off about my x. she ""just friended"" me, but I think the real reason was never mentioned. I hope she rots in hell. Emilys really nice. she seems really mature. I almost consider her a big sister, but not really. she just acts like she could be. Im getting sick of jester food. it all tastes the same. like shit. she's attractive. every girl here is really pretty, with some exceptions of course. so far, it seems like college has been all play and no work, except for this of course. there's so many people here. sometimes it's overwhelming. so much diversity. and yet, so much organization. I really like the atmosphere. the game last night was a blast. Ive never had so much fun at a game. so much spirit and energy running through the air. being in the band is the best thing that's happened to me in a long time. it's taught me a lot. I think Ive grown up so to speak. the idea of a computer lab strikes me as funny. all these people here, right next to each other, but there's still a sense of privacy. no one ever seems to look at other people's work. so much organization in so much chaos. I like Macs better than PCs. I don't know why. they just appeal to me more. I wish I had a girlfriend. it's been a long time since Ive been with someone. I miss it. I like the fact that my parents live here. we don't always get along, but I think that if they lived in another state, or even another city, I wouldn't be doing half as well here. I like the security. it's nice not having to miss them. and to not be homesick. I wish I could stay here forever. I don't want to have to get a job. but, at the same time, I often feel bad that my parents have to pay for my education. Ive always been that way. I really love my family, I just don't know how to show it very well. Im ready to start doing more work in classes. they're starting to get boring. I wonder what's to become of Ginny. Ive always liked her, ever since high school. she lives so far away, Alabama. Id love to date her. maybe because while I was with her, I never got the chance. damn, I wish I had the opportunity now. girls are so pretty. why?  sometimes, they get in the way of more important things. sometimes I like the distraction, but sometimes it hurts me. I think Im going to do well here. no problem. Im very good at adaptation. I think my time's about up. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Wow, this day has been hectic. I feel relieved that I got the math class I needed, finally. The people in the math dept. (at least sitting at the desk--- the ones I had, unfortunately, to deal with!)  They were so rude and just did things at their own pace as if the students don't have classes or things to do. It was so annoying that the lady wouldn't let me fill out the permission form myself. I mean, I'm in college for God's sake!  I can read and write and understand things pretty well. I think I can fill in the blanks for a unique # myself -- she wouldn't let me take it home since I hadn't decided which exact class of the 6 that I wanted. Then I had to come back the next day and wait in the long line again and deal with the same rude lady. I know their jobs are tedious and boring, but I don't like having to deal with adding and dropping either. You know, I just want to do it on Tex but I can't anymore!  The biggest pain was all the running around I had to do for this and the frustration it gave me!  I had to go to the professor's office find out his hours, then go to his hours the next day, sit in on class, find out that he doesn't accept late assignments and I've already missed 2 because of not being there, then trying to do the homework, getting the book, doing the homework, getting help from a friend, going back to the math dept. to find out if there was an opening in the class which there wasn't, going back at 8am to wait until they decided to open their doors around 8:45, find out the professor I wanted still doesn't have an opening and almost having to go through the whole process again, but the lady finally being nice to me and letting me go into another class and another professor without getting all the stuff signed. She said we were the last 5 people to get in and they had to take us so we didn't (thank G-d) have to go through it again. Now lets just hope I can understand this professor and that maybe he'll let me make up the assignments I've missed. I used to like math, but at the moment I am very ticked off at he entire idea of math because of this whole ordeal. In every other aspect of the university, or in many of them but not really all, I feel like I matter and I am not just my ssn. But dealing with this I feel like I am just being pushed around and can't get what I want. I know I won't always be able to get the classes I want or the times I want, I didn't get exactly what I wanted even registering in the first orientation this summer, but I am definitely lucky in that I got almost what I wanted it seems to work out. I just feel so unimportant because of this math dept. lady who could care less about me and my problem. I really expected her to tell me I had to go through the whole procedure again. Maybe she does have a heart since she didn't make me do it. I don't know. I just feel so, so small and belittled I guess. I don't know how to put it, I just feel bad in some strange way. Other than that problem and a few others that I need to take care of, I am really doing well here. I really feel at home and that I belong here. Coming from Atlanta, GA and moving, I know I'd love it, but I tried not to get my hopes up too high so that if things didn't work exactly as I planned I wouldn't be disappointed. I guess it worked because I do have to deal with these few problems and another big one, but I am still loving it!  I am so glad to be here!  I really feel like I mad the right decision. I'm meeting so many people and some of them I've already become great friends with because they are already caring and helping me with my problems and I'm helping them too. I'm really making some great bonds here!  I feel so loved!  And they don't call me to go out because they feel badly for me or anything, I feel that they genuinely want to hang out with me. Maybe that's just my perception but I really feel that way. and now I'm questioning myself, but I am serious and not just trying to make myself believe that. at least, I think so. But now I think I'm analyzing it all too deeply because I'm thinking -- but what if subconsciously I'm really just making myself believe that. I don't know. But I truly feel that it is a genuine feeling that I have that my friends are true friends for true reasons!  Ok. I think I'll stop here before I analyze every bit of this!   "
Tell me about yourself.,"As I sit here in my dorm room, I am thinking about what I am supposed to do tonight. I have signed with the fraternity Sigma Alpha Mu and I am not sure what pledging is going to be like. It could be tough and it could be easy. My roommate is here and he is going to take a nap so I need to try to be quiet as I type. I am kind of anxious about this year and what the year will be like. There are so many people here and I am not sure whether I am fitting in well or not. Anyway, I get side tracked easily. I am going to the house at 7 PM and there we are going to be introduced to all the older guys and then we will probably introduce ourselves to the rest of the pledge class. I am anxious to meet all the cool guys who I am going to be spending the rest of my life with in college and hopefully there after also. I miss all my close friends at home. I live in Atlanta Georgia and they are mostly going to UGA but some of them are spread out across the country. I miss my friend Pamela the most and my best friend Michael the 2nd most but hey I hope they come and visit but if they don't oh well. My mom worries me cause she thinks I am doing alot of bad thing s here at school but really Im not and I am being a good kid and trying to make good grades. I miss my little brother too. he is 13 years old and he is in 8th grade. I hope that he is having fun in junior high school cause I know I did. I keep telling him that high school is the best time of your life. He believes me but he cannot wait until next year when he can go to high school. My great grandmother is very sick and she is 97 years old. I went to visit her the day before I left for school and I was thinking that I may never see her again. She has lived a long and happy life and whenever the time comes, I know that god was the one who wanted her up there. M<y roommate is going to nap now for real and I am supposed to wake him up in an hour. I hope Im not still typing by then. The room is quiet now and I am the only one still making noise. My suite mates are all out at class and they will be back soon. I kind of always think about what I am going to be when I get older and when I am married and who am I going to marry and what my profession is going to be. I want to be an orthopedic surgeon but that is very hard to be and I am not sure if I can be that. But I set my goals already and that is my destiny for my future. I want to be successful and have a family of 4 and a nice looking, perfect wife who loves me for who I am not for what I look like or how much money I make. I am ending my stories with a quote :Shoot for the moon cause if you miss you will be amongst the stars. "

Tell me about yourself.,"Okay, Im not so sure where to begin. only that I feel betrayed. betrayed by a friend that I valued. I don't understand how it happened, but I know that things will never be the same again. I sort of thought that college might bring us closer together, but I have discovered that no matter where we are, he is a million miles away. I used to think I could get through to him, but I guess I was wrong. my friends tell me he is a part of the past, and that I should look to the future, but right now I think he just breaks my heart. perhaps Im thinking a little to much about this. I just need to get over it. until I do, I won't be able to connect with others because Im not reachable right now. my friends all warned me this would happen, but, as usual, I wouldn't listen. I just can't help it, I want to do things my own way. do I understand myself? no. sometimes I think that I am a total psycho and Im surprised I haven't scared people off already. I've met some nice people, but Im just not open for new friends right now, which is such a bad idea at this point in my life. well, it's not that Im not open to making new friends, it's that I have to let go of the past before I can pursue anything else. the trouble is that I know he is not thinking about this as much as I am. perhaps that is what hurts me the most. just knowing that our friendship meant more to me than to him. I talk to his friend, and his friend says to give it time. Im trying to, I swear. Im entirely too emotional about these things, I guess. I miss my best friends. I need someone to talk to. Im not sure about this whole sorority thing, but maybe Ill find my friends there. who knows?  thank God all those girls don't fit the sorority stereotype. that would be hell. but some of them are actually very cool. that makes me feel better because when I first met them all, I was scared shitless. I was so afraid, I almost cried. sometimes I think about what Im getting myself into, and I get scared again, but not like that. Ive never been scared like that. this such a scary place for me right now. maybe if I felt secure with my friends. I just think that this one guy will never really talk to me again, and it bothers me a lot. I just need to find something else to occupy my time. I really think he thinks Im a psycho. Ive got to stop thinking about this. remember what Ashley said: don't try to force things, if it's meant to be, it will happen. Im trying to keep that in mind, Ash. I guess everything is up to God at this point. it's all a matter of trust. At times Im just not willing to let someone else handle it. Ive just got to let go. of everything. this guy is not the only thing Ive been worrying about. I worry about my best friends. all of us at different schools. I think about what they're doing and if they're drunk right now or scared. sometimes I worry about myself. I kind of have a low self esteem. this sounds strange, but I think I like it. not liking myself. I think, in a way, it keeps you from getting arrogant. but on the other hand, maybe that, too, is a different kind of arrogance. thinking about yourself all the time, whether it be good or bad. why can't I reach you?  where are you?  I've got to stop thinking about things. the trouble with me, is that I don't obsess over many things, but the ones I do, it's often and it totally eats away at my life. it can kill me pieces at a time. Ive lost my appetite and sometimes my desire to go out. but when Im sitting there, holed up in my room feeling sorry for myself, I know that the rest of the world is moving on without me. especially here. at college. where no one cares. oh, Matchbox 20 is on the radio. that song really ""Push"" really hits me. some songs make me cry if they fit a particularly depressing aspect of my life well enough. I want to connect with other people the way that song connects with me. I just need to keep an open mind and get out there and do it. Carey told me once that I need to get off my butt and do things because Im not always going to get an invitation. this reminds me of Tim off in Colorado. I'm so glad Patch called to see if I could come home for Tim's birthday. I guess the relief lies in the security that comes from anything associated with Pre-college. but I wouldn't go back if I could. I was the one of my friends saying how excited I was to leave. and I was. Im glad Im here, but now that Im here, I don't know what to do. I really like this stream of consciousness stuff, and this is not because Im trying to kiss butt or anything, it's just that I write a lot of stuff like this to let off steam. it's my own form of closure for the problems in my life. Im thinking about going into journalism, but who knows?  it was the FBI last week. I think that if you don't have anyone to talk to, you have to at least write things down. Im starting to be friends with Brian. I hope we get to be good friends. the trouble with college is that people all know that everyone needs friends, but you can't be best friends with everyone. the friend that you find that you really relate to is rare. Im still searching. I feel like Im Holden Caulfield in Catcher. this kills me.  "
Tell me about yourself.,"Ok twenty minutes. what am I going to do tomorrow night?  What am I going to do tonight I've got lots of work to do. Man, there's lots to do and little time to do it in. I can't  wait, till I finish this. only. too much time left. What else, to write about. I have no stream of consciousness. ok, it's great to be next door to the RA, there's always a party next door, it  makes it easier to study that way. what else, what else. Ive got lots to do  tonight. what else. Austin, cool place. my roommates studying, thats what I've got to do. I wish I had a TV. it gets so boring at night. Ive got to call my girlfriend, man I miss her. . boy Im tired. this doesn't look like a lot of writing for. . 6 minutes. only six minutes. that means there's fourteen minutes left. I've got a real impressive stream of consciousness, and Im a good speller too  Fish think better than I do. what else. uh. I've got to go to the store buy  some food. go work out tomorrow. am I almost done yet. nooo. lots more time left  A guy in a coma, probably has a better stream of consciousness. what do I need to do tomorrow. I think Im going to apply for a credit card. why not?  man Im hungry. ten minutes left. halfway through. psychology. I hope this class will be interesting. it's a lot different than I thought it would be, all we do is fill out surveys about stuff. Oh well,, Im not looking forward to doing these experiment/research requirements. But it's gotta be better than writing a paper  I guess he paper is used as an alternative, because they know nobody will want to write a paper. and they want everybody to participate in the experiments seven minutes left  UT, UT, there's a game on Saturday, Im gonna have to get my tickets tomorrow before  they're all out. I don't want to sit all the way up at the top. my first game, can't wait, gonna be cool. Im glad I didn't go to Aggieland five minutes and counting. What else. chemistry. Ive got too much to do English. she assigned over one hundred pages of reading in two days. Chemistry. calculus. way too much too think about. college is gonna be more difficult than highschool, I can already tell this. three minutes. not bad. Wow I just got e mail I wonder who it is,,, Id like to know, but I've got two minutes left. It doesn't seem like its been twenty minutes. but oh two minutes left. Im sure this is not what they wanted. but thats me twenty four hours a day  pretty sad. oh well. come on come on one minute. yes  well this has been fun, at least I've gotten it finished. alright. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am so pissed right now because I was almost done and then my sweetmate's phone rang and I got disconnected and now I am just hoping that the phone doesn't ring again, I would like to get this done before the weekend begins. I am very excited about this weekend I think that it is going to be alot of fun. We are doing many things, let's see. Tonight we are going to Hillele first, which is a religious service (Jewish). Those are always nice,. Hillel reminds me of camp which I love. I go to a religious overnight camp in Wisconsin, Ramah. In my last letter I was wondering if anyone is even reading this, maybe you are just checking that we did this and that's it. I mean, it has to be incredibly boring to read 500 of these. although, as a psychologist maybe it is totally interesting, you get to analyze all of us. Those surveys well, I thought they were sort of pointless, just because as the teacher said (or you said if you are reading it), the research is meaningless if the patient knows what is being tested. It's not that I knew the hypothesis for all the surveys but they were pretty obvious and I could tell what the researchers were looking for. I like psychology so far though, I don't know if I am going to agree with everything though. I will have to see, but a friend of mine told me that it gets very logical and I am not the biggest supporter of logic. That must sound very stupid, well, that's not exactly what I mean, but I read this book, actually a short story, Teddy by JD Salinger, who I love and Teddy said you have to look at the world without logic to understand things better. He said that when Eve bit in the apple, she was really biting into logic. This seems very long, I have been writing for a while I also think I should stop because I am very nervous that the phone "
Tell me about yourself.,"my roommate just called- she wants me to go get the vacuum cleaner from Vivian. I dont want to do this because she'll say something about my bike, or the music. and I have to tell her about the fire alarm batteries being out because it was beeping. just while I was writing this I was thinking several different thoughts. I think it's not good that I dont respect vivian's wishes. I really admire her because she's so old. I am not as nice as I used to be. it's funny to think about  writing for twenty minutes straight. but then again, we're always thinking, so why  should it be hard to write what you're thinking. it's getting easier for me to put my  into words, which is good for my relationships, and not to mention my future. I still don't talk that much though because I don't like saying something about nothing. but I guess that's a skill too. oh well- not one of mine. James and I have been getting along really well. ever since I fell asleep on his couch wishing to end the relationship because the passion was not there. then he picked me up in his arms, and took me to his bed and I must have cried for 30 minutes at least. he's so good to me. turns out the passion was dormant. for us to have fun and not argue so much, we've both realized each other's work loads, acknowledged my problems about the past, seeing how we react to each other, and respond lovingly to each other. thinking of what I just wrote sounds unnatural to me. but in reality, in this case at least, it came automatically. he realized how upset I was, and I realized how much he  cared. he's pretty much the leader. his feelings are much more dominant, and he's stronger and truer than me. maybe because I don't always know what I want. then he makes it apparent that  he's what I want. I miss being able to play the field, but what good is that when I have a really good person already?  he makes me laugh and we love, which is most  important in the person I share most my time with. men with potential, men that can show me the world. they can be my friends. like Sean. like jt. probably like any one that comes into my life- everyone has something to offer. and I will take it. James just has more than the average Joe. oooo - I've already spent 15 minutes. I should do this everyday for 10 minutes. not only is it a break from numbers, but I acknowledge my  thoughts, and I can go back and read it in the future to see my development. I want to be a model or an actor. I want the spotlight. sometimes. I want  to be a better gymnast. I dont want to be judgmental. I want a copy of this. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Twenty minutes seems like a long time. It amazes me how weird time is. Like when you're sitting in a plane waiting to get off and it seems like hours, but it's only minutes. I spend alot of time on planes. My dad is a pilot. I fly free. I don't know what I will do after college, because then I don't fly free anymore. I won't be able to go anywhere whenever. My roommate is in the shower. She has a sorority thing tonight. I'm not in a sorority. I'm glad, it's not the place for me. A guy died in my hometown last weekend. I t was strange, because my roommate had just commented on deaths happening in threes, and Mother Theresa and Princess Diana had just died. I didn't know the guy at all, but still, that could have been anyone. I think about that a lot. Death. Like what if someone died that I knew, but I had never told them what they mean to me. That's selfish, I know, but that's what we are, we're selfish. We as in humans. A friend of mine in my psych class knew the guy who died. I like country music, but most people don't. I just started liking it last year, because my boyfriend at the time got me hooked on it. My back hurts. I like to rub people's backs. I wish someone was here to rub mine. Tonight I'll be alone in the dorm. I like that sometimes everyone just gets on your nerves. My roommate and I knew each other in high school. We have gotten along amazingly well so far. Knock on wood. I have never been in a car accident, when I was driving. My brother messed up his knee in a car accident. I like this song. He had to have his ACL ligament redone. He can be such a baby. I think men have an amazingly low pain tolerance. I really think that they just aren't as well equipped for pain. That's just a personal opinion. I give lots of personal opinions. People tell me I'm opinionated. I don't like people who can't discuss their opinions and thoughts. It's important to be able to communicate. I'm a speech major. My undergrad advisor is great. I met him at orientation, and I love him. He tells you exactly what he thinks and that is so important. I don't like this song. It's one of those depressing love songs that is so typical of country. I wonder if I'll get married. I think I want to, but not kids. I do not want kids. That's another one of my opinions. How can we bring a child into this world?  So then people ask me if  I wish I hadn't been born. Two completely different concepts. Anyway, I'm gonna call my Aunt Holly. She is like a second mother to me. I live my mother. She really is my lifeline. That's a scary thought, like could I survive without her?  Of course, she raised my to be a survivor. I love basketball. My mom and I watch games together all the time. The Rockets are my favorite team. I also like Dennis Rodman. But I hat e the bulls. Rodman always says what he is thinking. Some people think he's a little tooo crazy, but I love it. H breaks the mold. That's commendable in my book. I miss my cousins. One of them is a big basketball fan. He and I always talk basketball. I'm almost done, twenty minutes did not take as long as I thought it would. I really like this song. I'm finished!! "
Tell me about yourself.,"I guess I won't be looking forward to this weekend. Why? I won't be going home. At least I'll be able to get some work done if I stay here. It's hard to concentrate at home because there are so many distractions. All I know is that I have to focus on my  studies. This feels weird just babbling on. I don't even know where this is even heading. I feel like such a fool sitting here typing up things on this screen that don't even  make sense. I'm stuck. Okay, never mind, I'll think of something to say. At least  I should be happy that I was able to get access to this computer. Stuck again. It's amazing how  when I'm asked to say things, I usually don't know what to say. This feels weird. Maybe the next time  I do this, I should do it in a private place, so people won't be wondering what the heck I'm doing or constantly looking over at my screen to catch a glimpse of what it is I'm doing here. Who cares anyway. I can't believe have so much work to do when I get back. Forget about that for now. I'll deal with that later. I wish I wouldn't procrastinate sometimes. This assignment is so similar to the one that I had to do everyday in my high school sophomore English class. I couldn't believe all the things I had written. I think this guy sitting next to me is getting annoyed. He's making some sort of grunting sounds. Oh well, I guess he'll have to put up with it for  another ten minutes. I'm so nervous about tomorrow. Going out to join the tennis club. I haven't played in awhile. I hope  they have plenty of extra balls because they might be losing a few tomorrow. I need the exercise anyway. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I have so much to do. I need to go get ready for track, but I would really  like to sit down and relax. perhaps go outside and sit by the pool and  catch some rays. I c9ompletly failed my music quiz. I wish I could have  prepared better. I  have been running around and it would feel so nice to just sit down and relax. What am I writing about. This seems so odd to  'sit here and write what I am thinking. I feel like  I should be trying to  keep my typing neat. and worry about spelling/grammar. Oh well. I am very sore. I wish that I didn't work out so hard because now I'm  paying for it. I really need to go read my kinesiology work. I wonder if  the person who reads this what she thinks, She must get so many strange responses. I hope this goes through the email system in time. I have  random thoughts. I guess everyone's thoughts are random. I wonder How Catherine is doing. I really need to call her but I don't have the m money for this month to spend on more long distance calls. It's so weird being away from dad and mom. I almost miss the nagging, but I guess  Kelly's taking their place. She really mad me mad last night. I wish she would be more considerate when getting dressed in the morning and ready for bed at night. The boyfriend thing is getting out of hand. Why doe's so someone want to go around and tell people that her boyfriend is psychotic? I hope Lauren's roommate mobes out so that I can talk about mobing in with Lauren at the end of the semester, but I feel bad leaving Kelly, but if she is going to be this much of a perfectionist and somewhat inconsiderate I have to look out for myself. I hope John is doing well with his Steave  situation. I know that I could help him out, but I don't want to be the know it all little sister. John is so sweet and I dont' want Steve to  push him around. I think I've been writhing for a long time yep, it's been 20 min. bye. "
Tell me about yourself.,"You know, when typing on a computer, twenty minutes is a long time. Figuring a person types 60 to 80 words per minutes, they will be typing between 1200 words and 1600 words per minute. I wonder if this assignment would be more effective if the students had to write it in pen, so that you could also see how they changed their mind. I know that I have already erased and retyped. I don't mean that I have taken the stream of consciousness out of it, just that I will change my mind on how I want to phrase things. I want this to make sense to any poor, unfortunate person who has to read this thing, and sometimes I takes me a while figure out a way to phrase thing that will accurately get the message of what I am trying to express across. Okay, I have managed to confuse myself with this stuff that I am saying. Somehow I don't consider it to be a good sign when I can confuse myself with something that I am thinking. It's too bad that I type faster than I think b/c right now I can even get all of my thoughts down. Wow, it finally put me on another line!  I don't have any idea what time I actually started typing. I remember looking at the clock at 5:13, but I was already typing then. I guess that I will just count that as my starting time, I am guessing that it really doesn't matter how long I write. Back to the confusing myself thing. you know, I have a habit of confusing myself. I will ask myself questions or think about ideas which really are lacking in logic, or else they have a strange logic. For example, at my high school, I am famous for my opinions about being normal. I once told my friend that I was the only normal person, and that the rest of them were all abnormal. Having said this, I realize that if I am the only normal person, that would make it abnormal to be normal, and normal to be abnormal. This would mean that although I was the only normal person in the group, I was really abnormal b/c it is normal to be abnormal and abnormal to be normal. At first this appears to make no sense, but once you think about it for a while, it starts to make perfect sense, at least to me anyway. And those people who have been blessed enough to hear this theory get it eventually. I have no idea if I am supposed to be writing this thing as if I was talking to someone, but that is really the only way that I can write it. I am used to writing emails a lot like this, and I have a tendency to talk like this too. I will say, or write whatever is on my mind. This  results in a lack of sentences in my emails. I separate the thoughts with little dots. everything is in sentence fragments. I just write what I am thinking at the time. That is why I was so happy about this assignment, imagine, I am getting a grade for doing something that I do all the time!  But then again, it's not like the people I write to hate my emails. In fact, most of them love my emails. My boyfriend, Justin, always tells me how much he loves my emails. And lately, I have noticed that I have been influencing people with the way I write. More and more of my friends have started writing very stream of consciousness emails to me. I like them though, b/c I think that they give a greater insight into how a person if feeling and what they are thinking. I am a terrible speller, and a bad typer too. I can type really fast, but I am not high on the accuracy. Sometimes I do really great, but other times, well. it's embarrassing. I think that in college I am gonna major in typos and creative spelling!  I haven't eaten anything today. It is 5:26 now. I guess after I finish this I will go back to the dorm room and then I will go eat dinner. Or maybe I won't. I am not really that hungry but I feel bad about wasting meal tickets. Last week I didn't eat anywhere near the two meals a day that we bought. I might just go and eat some yogurt that I have in the fridge. The advantage to not eating, and then getting all this extra exercise walking around this school, is that it will help me get in shape. This is ridiculous, it has been 15 minutes and I am only on the [now] fifth line!  You know, I don't like typing. I think that I am a candidate for carpal tunnel. I am exaggerating a bit, but my hands get tired quickly from typing. I think that I strain them b/c the table is too high and therefore I am resting my hands on the keyboard too much. I just moved the keyboard to my lap and that actually helps. I am a semi computer nerd. I know about software, and how to use the web. However, I am not a hacker, and my knowledge of hardware is not the best. maybe average. I can build my own computer, or do anything illegal. but put a program in front of me, and I will either know how to use it, or else I will figure out how to use it fairly quickly. I am glad that this about finished. It is actually tiring trying to keep up with what I am thinking. I just finished psych class and so I decided to stop at the pcl library and do this before I forget. I meant to do these assignments this weekend, but I forgot. actually, I just didn't get time. My best friends online boyfriend came to Houston this weekend, and I am friends with him too, so I wanted to meet him also. He flew in from Anderson CA. quite far. We had never met him before now. He is really nice too, only. he is a bit inappropriate acting, in that he was feeling me, and he even French kissed me. he felt on Amber (my friend) too, and kissed her more. but the point is, his hands should only be up one person's shirt. and that is Amber, not me!  I hope that this won't really get published b/c this stuff about Giovanni is not something that I want everyone to find out about. He was still really nice, and I liked him. just not romantically. I guess maybe he is just like that. I did tell Amber about what happened. I needed to, if she didn't mind(which, for some reason, she didn't), then it's all good. well, 'cept that I don't want him to kiss me, or feel up my shirt or in my overalls. That is why I won't let him do it again. however, I don't know when or if I will see him again, so it may never come up. Anyway, time is up, so I am gonna submit this thing, and hike it back to the dorm. actually the dorm isn't too far!  I might sit outside and read the paper before going back though. It will depend on how I feel. Okay, here it is. hope it was helpful, or served the purpose it was supposed to. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I have to go to an experiment for Psychology in 45 minutes. My hand really hurts because I burned it on my curling iron. I had a really awesome dream last night but Rachel woke me up from it. I miss my mom. I wonder how she is doing. I will visit her soon, though. I have a lot of homework this weekend. I am only concerned about Chemistry since I haven't had it since 10th grade. My hand still hurts. I did my aerobics today. I wonder what the experiment will be this afternoon. I hope that I finish early. I have not been writing that long but it feels like forever. I am glad that my roommate and I are getting along. She is my best friend since seventh grade. My hand is feeling better now. I hope that my hair isn't losing its curl because I have to leave for the experiment right after this. I wonder when my cough will finally go away. The MTV music awards last night were cool. The funniest part was Marilyn Manson. My hand has a red spot on it from the burn. I wonder if we are still gonna go to the frat party tonight. I have a lot of homework still. I hope that I don't fall into the trap of freshman laziness and have my grades slip. My face itches. I am slightly worried about my earring hole--whether or not it's infected. Now my nose itches. AUGH!  Only five minutes have passed!  I want to go back to my room and work on my chemistry so that I'll feel better. I am excited about tomorrows football game. My back is getting sore so I'd better sit up straight. I'm glad that I'm getting this assignment out of the way. I wonder if Kevin and Briar will get married. I hope so because I really like Briar and it would be cool for her to be my sis-in-law. I wonder who I'll marry. What if I don't find anyone?  That would totally suck. However, I refuse to settle for just anyone. I wonder if I should change my major to Psychology. I love stuff like these experiments. The girl next to me just introduced herself and left. She seemed nice. Her name is Sherrie. I will never remember that. If I major in Psychology, I don't know if that will hurt my chances of getting into Med-shcool. I don't know what to do. My hand hurts again. Oh, wow, I'm almost done!  This assignment is so easy and kinda fun. Now my arm itches. My boss was named Sherrie. This girl probably didn't even spell her name like that. Now my hands are getting cramped. I feel kinda bad about talking about Kristy because she was cool today. But that doesn't make up for her being annoying every other day. Now my head itches. I think that I have dry skin. At least my mosquito bites are gone. I wonder if Melissa and Rachel are back yet. I have to cough again. This is getting really annoying. Russ is so cute. I would love to date him if he wasn't me brother's best friend. My hand really hurts now. I hope that I am almost done because I can't type much longer. I am glad that it's the weekend. Pennebaker is so funny. All my classes are cool. OWWWW!  My hand. I am a pain wimp. Three more minutes!  Lots of people that were in here are gone now. I like Kinsolving because I don't have to go to Flawn for the internet. My fingernails look very pink today. I forgot to take my vitamins today!  My  hand really hurts and my eyes are getting tired. My fingers feel swollen. I wonder when I will meet and date some guys here. Hopefully it will be soon. I hope that no one is standing behind me reading this because I'm sure they'd wonder why I am writing this diary. My time is up!  Yeah!  I have to go to my room to check my hair and lipstick again before I go. Bye! "
Tell me about yourself.,"Im in the mood to write and so I decided to do this writing assignment. sometimes I get in this mood to write anything and everything thats on my mind. I guess it only happens when Im bothered by something. time and time again thought it always seems to be about people and my interactions with them and how they are so I dont know. how should I describe. I guess I was too sheltered to know how much people can hurt someone. why are people so selfish and care so much about their own well-being?  why does it hurt the good guy to be good. it seems the nicer you are, the more naive and innocent. the more you get hurt. youd think id get the hang of it by now. but I dont want to become like them. whoevers reading this. are you Christian?  I am. or I believe in God and His Son Jesus Christ and I try to follow his ways. but it hurts so much because to win is to lose and yet I know Im doing something wrong because in psalms its says to be as harmless as doves and wise as serpents. I think I've got the harmless as doves thing down, but Im not very wise. I always get so hurt. I dont know what to say. my thoughts dont seem to be flowing and I cant seem to get what's on my mind out on this screen. I wish everyone were. how come I cant think. but Im supposed to write for 20 minutes so I guess ill continue. no, Im not totally disappointed with all people or anything if thats what it sounds like. in fact I love my first roommate. she was so good so unselfish. so caring and hardworking. then there's my second roommate. I gave so much to her. honestly. and literally. she never once cooked for me yet I always for her. she never once cleaned yet I never complained. I bought the groceries and cooked and she ate. I cared for her well being. I never said anything to hurt her. I dont even know how to describe. I really did care about her well being. as roommates, I thought of her as my sister in caring about her. and I tried to show her gods love. her mom came to visit for a month. I gave up my bed and moved into the living room  since we had a one bedroom. living with anyones mother, anyone else would complain. the whole month she was there. I still cleaned. but she did cook. although I didnt eat at home that much. I tried to go home late and leave early because it wasnt very comfortable with someone elses mom at home. I tried my best. and I really thought my old roommate appreciated it. then the day before they moved out I noticed I was missing some silverware and a pair of shoes and since the mom was packing, I presumed she must have misplaced. so I left a note before I left for school to check for me - that Im not sure how many silverware because I lost some in moving before and so its not too many Im sure, but a few. when I came home that evening. there were my pair of shoes and a few silverware she took out all her silverware and started to make me look at every single thing saying, ""look! this is ours,""  then another wrapped piece,  saying ""look,""  and more and more. I was so shocked. I told her I didnt mean to accuse her of stealing, if thats what she had mistaken it, but  she said no, thats not it  well its been over 20 minutes now. and in the end she ended up misplacing more of my stuff and I wasnt going to bother asking about them. but it hurt me. not that she took the stuff, but to come out like that. after living together. I have a third roommate now (thank goodness the 2nd was only for the summer)and I hope everything goes well. I wrote about this because I saw my 2nd roommate today. and though we never fought I dont think were friends anymore. and every time I think of her,  Im hurt. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, here I go, writing for 20 minutes. This really feels weird, but I  guess I have to do it. Actually I am glad I am doing this assignment because I dreaded doing it and now I can get it over with. It's just that 20 minutes seems like such a long time to sit here and write about nothing. I just don't know what to do and I feel very uncomfortable. Hmmm. Princess Diana died early this morning. I have felt so sad. When I first heard of her car accident last night I tried to pray for her, but I felt as she would not want to live but rather die. I have been reading and studying about near-death experiences and most people studied/interviewed have said that they usually do not want to come ""back"" after being pronounced dead. Anyway, I think she is in a better place, hopefully there will be no media hounding her wherever she is at now. The ceiling fan in this room bothers me when it is on high. Sometimes I'd rather be hot than have to hear the loud roaring noise. My dogs just came upstairs. I wonder what they are thinking about?  Do they think like we do?  What could be going through their minds?  I know I am supposed to write without worrying about grammar, punctuation, spelling, etc. , but I do, and I try to correct everything as I go. I keep looking at the clock and time is going very slow. I notice we have two clocks now on the desk. One is new, a prize or rather a gift for purchasing something. This room has so many things in it. I wish it was a bigger room. I like spacious things, I hate to feel crowded. I seem to be complaining so much right now, I guess I am tired and a little sleepy, and get grumpy. Why do we have some many things!  So many papers, junk, wiries, toys things, things, things!  Do we need all these things?  Can we live without all this things?  Yes, we can! Thank God! I can't stop writing but I would like to. Oh well. I just thought about a bakery, H. E. B. bakery to be exact. I keep craving sweets, so maybe that is why. I saw a white cake with pink frosting. My sister also came to mind. Hmmm, this is interesting because she is a professional baker and creates luscious deserts!  It is so dark outside, I hate having the windows closed, I like to hear the outdoors. I love the outdoors. Oh God 3 more minutes of this. I just feel like my mind is completely empty right now. I wonder if this happens when one is really tired?  I feel very old today. I like this computer, I guess I am pretty lucky to own one. I'm sorry I have been so negative, but this is how I feel right now. However, my time is up , hip hip hooray! Bye!  "
Tell me about yourself.,"I just got back from aerobics. It was really hard and kicked my butt today. I learned how to box. I really wish I knew how to box. I could kick George Forman's butt. George Forman lives 5 minutes from my house in Kingwood. I have seen his house before and it is really cool. Mark lives around there. I wish I could punch Mark's face in now. He is such a jerk. I hope he is happy without me. That was a profound statement. This assignment is so boring. Why do we have to do this. I hope I don't fail out of college. My dad would kick my butt and make me go to Kingwood College. That is not cool. I would absolutely kill myself if I had to go to Kingwood college. Jeremy went to Kingwood College. now he goes to Tech. haha. I wonder if I will ever see him again. Maybe so. Steve is so much better than he is. I wish Steve would have asked me out a year ago instead of Jeremy. I have so much work to do tonight and I'm so tired. plus I have to got o that mixer tomorrow night. But I hope I don't have to go to my eight o clock class tomorrow. eight o clock classes should be outlawed. No one should have to be awake that early. The food here really sucks. My Mom's cooking is so much better than this stuff. it's like prison food. That was really gross in the move Sleepers when Kevin Bacon's character made those boys eat their food off the prison floor. Then he beat them up. That movie was really disturbing. I bet stuff like that goes on in all kinds of prisons. I 'm against the death penalty. ""Why do we kill people to show  other people that killing is wrong?""  That is my most favorite quote of all time. Kevin Bacon's character deserved to die though. Kevin Bacon is really good looking. Every time I see him in a movie, I remember him dancing in Footloose and I start to laugh. His character's name in that movie Was Ren. Like Ren and Stimpy. I hat that show. It used to be really funny, but now it is just disgusting. These guys that eat in the Kinsolving cafeteria are disgusting. None of the good-looking guys come by our dorm. We must be losers. Why would they come by our dorm?  We are the best looking girls in our dorm. Everyone else is disgusting. Except for Jenn, Katie, Amanda and Alison. I'm glad Allison and I are becoming friends. It is really cool how her dad and my dad roomed together and now Ali an d I will room together in our apartment next year. I think my dad wants me to room with her and Katie in a apartment next year. Maybe one other girl. I can't even think to next year. I will be 19 on Friday. That seems so old. Princess Diana was 19 when she married Prince Charles, I think. That is so sad that she died. I've watched so many news stories on her lately. It makes me sad. I want to watch the funeral on Saturday. I hope we get home from Waco on time. I'm excited to go to Waco. It will be so much fun and Steve will make my birthday really nice. Although he is trying too hard. That is a turnoff. But he is such a sweet guy that I could never do anything to hurt him. He has really low self-esteem. And he is quite inexperienced. He is so much better than any of the other guys I have dated--but I dont know if I like him. I like jerk guys I guess. Really good-looking cocky guys. Like Mark. and Jeremy. and Linsey. I wonder why Lindsey never liked me. I wish he would have. Even though he is a player, I bet I could change him. Yeah right. Wishful thinking. He is the best looking guy I have ever dated. Even though it was a short fling. It was worth it. He is so good-looking. Why does Steve put up with a jerk like him for a best friend?  I have no clue. Poor Steve--I think he lives in Lindsey's shadow most of the4 time. That really sucks. I'm glad I don't do that. I can't wait for the weekend--It will be awesome. And I also can't wait for the 20 minutes to be up so I can finish this stupid assignment. My hands are getting tired. I should add that to my list of aches and pains form my aerobics class. I hope Kathryn doesn't come to that class on Thursday. I don't think Katie and I could stand it. Well, my time is almost up and I need to do my other buttloads of homework tonight. Later. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am going to take 20 minutes to do this psychology assignment. It's the end of the first week, and I already have tons of homework. I am getting a little homesick. It's ridiculous. I miss El Paso, even though it is soooo boring. The phone is ringing, but I am not going to answer it. I need to go to a store and buy a calculator. If I keep busy, I won't get as homesick. I am watching tennis on TV at the same time that I am writing this. I have such compassion for Monica Seles with everything that she has been through. Oops, miss-hit. I miss playing tennis at home. I am doing laundry, so I probably need to get the clothes out of the dryer, but I don't want to yet. Bad call on the Henman match. I am going to have to shower before I go to Hillel tonight. I've got a real bad headache. I need to figure out how to send and receive mail on my new internet service. Maybe I'll just unplug my phone, and use the existing AOL just for mail. Great Shot!!  I'll go through the internet for everything else, but since everyone already knows my AOL screen name, I'll keep it for the mail. My parents would be paying for it anyway, since it's on their account. Before I am done typing this, I need to get the unique number and professor's name and everything. I'll have to find it. This assignment is actually kind of fun. I'm really homesick, but I'll get over it sometime (hopefully). It's really hot in this room. Grandma and Grandpa are coming in, but I forgot when. I have so much that I need to do, that I forgot what it all is. My twenty minutes is up, I need to check my laundry. "
Tell me about yourself.,"September 4, 1997      Well, here I go beginning my stream of consciousness. I really don't know  why I put the date up at top, just that I do that with everything, apologize if it offends you. Right now I am freaking out on my foot, which is almost killing me today. I swear I think I have the largest foot blister ever created currently on my foot and its not fun because I can't run, jog and it even hurts to walk on the thing. I have trouble putting on socks because the blasted  thing hurts so bad. I'm really beginning to wonder what I did to deserve that, I really don't think I've messed anyone up really bad lately. I've actually been kinda nice lately, which I usually am. Well, I guess nice unless you  consider what I did on Monday night. You see, some people keep calling up our dorm room and asking if its the Perry Castaneda library. I had been telling  them that it wasn't until I got sick of it. So some girl called on Monday and asked how long we were open. I told her we'd be open until 12:00 midnight  and that if she hurried she could catch us before we closed. I guess it was  kinda mean but I also thought it was really funny. Well, my hands are already starting to hurt me and that's not good because I have about fourteen minutes left. anyway, I'm starting to get hungry now but I still have more work to do so I figure I'll leave after I'm done with it all, which will take forever. Oooh, look at her, I guess I'm definitely going to have to move after I'm done here. Oh, by the way, I'm in the SMF at the library so I can be easily distracted while I'm doing this. I must confess I do that quite a bit, like the girl sitting next to me in class today, of course, I did listen to the lecture, but it was still kind of a distraction. Anyway, wondering what to type now to let you know  what's going on in my sick little head. Hey, you ever hear why ice is no longer  available at the Texas A&M cafeteria?     The senior who knew the recipe graduated. I have alot of questions like that. For instance, if you throw a cat out a window, does it become kitty litter?  If olive oil is made of olives,  what is  baby oil made of?    Why is abbreviation such a long word?   Why do they put Braille on ATM machines?  Speaking of blind, what about those signs that say, ""No Eye Seeing Dogs. ""  I mean, who's that sign for?  The blind man or the dog? At the special Olympics, do they have reserved spots for non-handicapped persons? How does the guy who drives the snow plow get to work?   Why do they sterilize needles for lethal injections?  Does a radioactive cat have 18 lives?  If you shoot a mime, should you use a silencer?   If Styrofoam packs everything, what do they pack Styrofoam in?  Why is it that you drive on Parkways and park on  driveways?  If nothing sticks to Teflon, how do they get Teflon to stick on the  pan?   If Alsups is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, why are there locks on the door?  Why is it that whenever you transport something by ship,  its called cargo and when you transport it by car, its called a shipment?  Why do they call it taking a dump when you're actually leaving something?  Anyway, those are the crazy things that go through my mind. Hopefully, I won't be classified as a loony and become subjected to further tests or something. Until next time. "
Tell me about yourself.,"So many things I need to get done this week. All of the thinking and remembering gets stressful, but at the same time it's so much fun to be on my own. I had a great workout today at World's Gym. I feel bad that I couldn't do a step aerobics class, but their schedule didn't blend well with mine. Tomorrow I will accomplish more. I think my day and my feelings are dependent on the amount of exercise I get. I love the feeling when I'm lying in bed at night that I ate very healthy and gave my heart a great workout. I wonder if I'll be happiest being a nutritionist. I've never been able to put my finger on exactly what I want to be. It makes me wonder about those people who become something great and recall in an interview that it's what they wanted to do their whole life, since they could remember. Could that actually be?  I know I've wanted to be very successful since I could remember. I've always wanted enough money to buy without thinking twice about my purchase. At around thirteen or so I decided that becoming a doctor was my goal and nothing could stop me. Now, in actuality, it's possible. I've always made the grades excelling in math and science. I do know it takes a great deal more, but I feel I'm moving in the right direction. My ultimate question is, did I set my goal on becoming a doctor at such a young age because of that profession's stereotype?  Doctors have lots of money and great cars, and I wonder if that's what made me so determined?  But, at the same time biology is my favorite topic to study. I have this strong love for the learning channel when they're showing a surgical procedure. Nothing can take me away from the TV. But possibly it's my subconscious telling me that I need to love it?  I think I'm thinking about the whole thing a little too hard. I need to start going with the flow of things instead of always feeling I need to have my agenda totally planned out. I feel so much better if I've sat down and scheduled my next day. Sometimes I follow the schedule minute by minute, and sometimes I don't. It really doesn't bother me either way if I actually stick to the whole thing. I'm noticing my times up and I almost feel sad. No ones probably going to read this whole thing, or maybe not at all. But I now see why people find diaries therapeutic. This is just like having a diary. I like it and it made me feel better than I did 22 minutes ago. Thanks, whoever! "
Tell me about yourself.,"MMM I was just thinking about the rolls  from Kinsolving. My friends are in my room just got really quiet so I felt very conscious of there presence. I don't know what I'm thinking about!!  I am now looking at my nails-- I've been biting my nails so there not very long anymore. I'm wondering how long 20 minutes is going to be for this assignments. I really miss my friend Monica, my best friend. She would be able to make friends so easily here at UT. I am worried because I need to make study buddies. I hope my classes won't be too hard. the back of my desk is old-- well, not the back of my desk the drawer is cold   I'm so blank   I guess  when I have to write down my thoughts, it's harder   My typing sucks-- I type okay but I make a lot of mistakes that keep me from typing all of my thoughts. I hope I don't gain weight  while I am here. I need to lose 15 more pounds but it's so hard when I have to eat in a cafeteria-- there are too many temptations  I wonder where Aubrey is, she didn't even tell me What just happened to my computer-- I thought I had lost my entire entry  I am so tired  I walked a lot today. I've already written for about 14 minutes-- that went by pretty fast  should I go the Grease thing? I don't want tulle on my window-- is that the way you spell tulle?  Roni just told me it is spelled tulle. How am I suppose to know how to spell tulle  I wish someone was in love with me-  I wish I could find someone to love. Most of the guys around here seem to ignore my presence I remember this episode of Friends  The guy is so rude  I love Friends  it is so funny  Wow, it's practically been 20 minutes-- my wrist hurts from typing so much  That girl is so funny-- I can't wait until the new episodes come out-- if I have time!!  That settles it-- it's been over 20 minutes. So I guess I'll you go  "
Tell me about yourself.,"  I like the idea of doing class assignments over the WWW. it's much easier. I think someday all assignments and teaching will be done through a web of interlinked computers. Students will sit at home in the same spot every day and fulfill their college requirements without ever seeing a professor or fellow student. I wouldn't like that however. Something would be lost without the direct personal lectures. A person telling me something with a unique style and delivery leaves a greater impression on me than any computer text ever could. I feel like I'm sticking with this subject too long, I'm thinking with too much structure. But I think that is the way I am. Before I communicate, whether by typing on a computer or talking to someone, I usually have a solid idea of what I'm going to say. I don't usually have spontaneous outbursts or a direct communication of a free flowing consciousness. I hear someone whistling in the hall, he's probably an active who will make me clean some mess up. oh well. Wow I reached the second line, I just figured this entire submission would be one never ending line of text; like some huge sentence that rambles on and on and says nothing. Isn't that ironic. I have something in the back of my head that says all this writing is just meaningless rambling. But if this is an exercise to allow my free flowing mind to be translated onto paper, that would mean that what I'm thinking is just meaningless rambling. It's always like that. My mind just jumps from random thought to random sensation (this chair isn't too comfortable) at light speed. No matter how fast I write, I don't think I could ever capture the zany, random, chaotic, and highly elusive thoughts that tickle my neurons for a millisecond then become forgotten in the same instant. But if they become forgotten how do I know about them?  I wonder what I'll do tonight. I'm not sure at all. It's one of those times when I could have fun doing anything. I might. I don't know. it doesn't even matter. I don't know what else to write. I'm at a loss. Maybe by brain just hopped down a frequency. I just went from the imaginative (sort of) colorful thought chord (you know the kind you get when you read a good sci-fi book), to a superficial lethargic tone. I feel like a cave man, the only thing my mind says right now is ""food. ""  Thank you. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am sitting at my kitchen table right now and I am really frustrated. I am trying to write an English paper and it is so bad. I think I am so stupid sometimes. It really frustrates me when I can't do something perfect. I am also feeling kind of lonely today. I wish I was living at Hardin House because that is where all my friends live. They all seem to be making so many new friends and I just don't feel that way. I am loving college in some ways and in other ways I hate it. I really want a boyfriend. Alot of my friends have been asked to all these pledge lines and I just haven't. Am I ugly?  Am I fat?  Sometimes I just want to know what exactly in wrong with me. I am tired of drinking. Everybody in Austin is an alcoholic. It makes me feel terrible and lazy. It is fun for a while and then the next day you feel like crap. My roommates still aren't back yet from San Antonio. What's wrong?  My other roommate is getting in the shower. I wonder why. I wonder why Bobby Piper hasn't called me. He was my date a few nights ago. He was such a gentleman. I don't think we could ever date though. I am not a very good dancer. I get real nervous when I am on the dance floor. My friends from Arkansas left today. I didn't go out with them last night. I read my friends paper and she was talking about how drunk she was at the time. It kind of shocked me. It was kind of funny though. I think it gives me more self-esteem when guys like me. Is that horrible?  Diet coke is so gross. Why am I drinking one right now?  Should I call my brother?  His girlfriend is so awesome. She is one of my favorite people in the entire world. I love my brother too but he gets drunk too much. I hope he doesnt become an alcoholic. I wish people would come see me. I get kind of lonely sometimes or maybe it is that I don't want to be doing my work right now. I kind of like homework though because when I am done I get a feeling of accomplishment. That is also why I like to run. Because when I am done I get a feeling of accomplishment. I am really nervous about my English paper. I don't think it is very good. I am going to rewrite it now since I gave been rambling for twenty minutes. I need to pray. I wonder if God is always listening. Oh well, I'll stop now. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am currently sitting in the computer lab in the lobby of Jester. I have just finished my final class for the day, so I figured that I would go ahead and get caught up on my homework for my psychology class. I have never taken any kind  of psychology class, so I don't really know what to expect. Hopefully it won't be a hard class because some of my other ones are pretty hard, and I wasn't use to doing a lot of work and studying in high school. I liked high school a lot, and kind of wish that I was still in it. I sort of miss all of my friends and it just isn't the same to party without all of them. I went home for the Labor Day holidays and partied with them, but now that I'm back in Austin everything has changed back again. I haven't really met many people since I've been here, but I can say that there are quite a few weird people. Hopefully I will get use to Austin soon because it hasn't really worked out too well just yet. I've  already received two speeding tickets, a parking ticket, and had my truck towed once since I moved in two weeks ago. My parents aren't too happy with me right  now, so I've got to get good grades to get them off of my back. I keep screwing  up on this computer and don't really know what I'm doing. I never have been too good with computers-even though I have taken several classes in high school. I  can type rather quickly, but that is about all. My fingers are getting tired of typing because I haven't typed all summer. I guess I need to get use to it since I'm going to be doing a lot of it now that I'm in college. I'm not too happy  right now because I have to type this paper in the lobby computer room. I just  brought back with me a notebook computer that my mom gave me, but I can't get the CD-ROM to work. The stupid thing won't read the disks for some reason, so I haven't been able to hook up the UT Connect package that I just bought. I think I made a few people mad when I went to purchase that UT Connect package because  there was a long line and I sort of cut to the front on accident. I was just  trying to ask the person a question about what line to get in, and he thought  that I had already been waiting, and that it was my turn. Even though the guy that I cut in front of looked kinda pissed, I wasn't about to turn around and  get at the back of the line. Last week I waited in it over an hour and even  though I feel kinda bad for that guy, it was worth it. My eyes are getting tired of staring at this screen and I'm for my time to be up. I guess I still have a  few minutes until dinner starts so I'll write for a little while longer. I didn't get much sleep last night because I just couldn't fall asleep for some reason. Some friends and I watched the movie The Program, and that lasted until about 2:30, and I still couldn't go to bed after that. I didn't have to wake up until 10:00, but I only had like 5 hours of sleep. Hopefully I can go to bed tonight with no problem. My hands are getting a little sweaty from typing so much, but I really do like to type. I'm not all familiar with the internet and the web, but  I would like to be. I'm in an English lab class, so that will probably help me out a lot. I'm sitting next a guy that can type about 400 words a second-at least that's what it sounds like-and it is kind of getting on my nerves. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Im so uptight about writing this. There is so much on my mind that I do not even know where to start. Cristina is trying so hard to get Donny to live with her and it works out great if he does, but I just do not know how it will work. if my sister starts to bother him then he will tell me about it, and by the same token if he bothers her I will be the first to hear it. I do not understand why I am so lazy lately. it took me an hour to just decide to get down here to do this and all of my other classes are the same way. I am so nervous about trying out for spirits and dance team on Wednesday I just do not know if I can do it, it all sounds like fun, but what if Disney and Lauren get in and I don't? I am the one who told Lauren about it in the first place and I dont think that it would be fair. I need to get my room clean before mom and dad get home , do some homework, take a nap, read a few chapters for psychology, Im so glad that I got Jessicas drivers license mailed to he shes probably going to be pissed off because it took so long but I have just been so busy. I wonder how shes doing since Anthonys not around/ maybe ill call her later after I have done everything else. . I totally forgot to tell Cristina that I got a 49 out of 0 on my very first math quiz. mom should be happy, she'll probably just say it was easy anyway but Im happy about it and I know Donny will be too. some time soon I need to go to the mec to find out if my Spanish credit is in yet. I cant believe I never would have guessed in a million years that I would be a sophomore in college by the end of my first semester. Donny and I are going to be late to dinner at cricky's tonight if he has to mow so many people's yards, but why am I worried about it they talked an agreed on a certain time then its none of my business. I hope he wont get rid of Nikki, I love that cat and if I did not live at home I would take her. maybe Donny and I will get married at the end of this year after all then we wont have to worry about stupid little things like this and rent will be alot easier to pay if there are two of us contributing to the cause. I wonder what our babies are going to be like. I think that all of the boys will be just like him, moody. what will it be like to engaged as sophomores in college, that is if we aren't engaged in a month that would be wonderful I know it would motivate me to work alot harder. "
Tell me about yourself.,"College seems very stressful. It's not like high school where you are playing only to get into college, now, more or less, you are playing for the rest of your life. It seems rather dramatic when you think about it. How can an eighteen year old hold the future in his or her hands. That seems rather demanding. However, the possibility of greatness and success can motivate five- year olds, it seems. Anyway, 40000 people is certainly a lot to contend with. Pressure seems to fill the air everywhere. Not that I mind it at all. I kind of like the atmosphere that engulfs Texas. The attitude of ""wanting to learn "" is beneficial to everyone involved in the higher education process. High School seems like a distant memory now that I'm here. It's extremely hard to imagine that only a few months ago I was a Senior. Man was that fun to say. I enjoyed every second of my senior year, but this year will be so much better. Thinking of the Princess Diana tragedy. . She was a wonderful woman. I think that outside her death, the biggest tragedy to come out of this deal is the fate of her children. I couldn't possibly imagine the stress and trauma of losing my mother. That's seems incomprehensible at my age. I look now to the rest of the school year. It seems so intimidating right now. I don't know how the courses will be and I hope that my work ethic will stand firm. I think that my favorite quote is ""Greatness courts failure""  I dont think there is anything more true in this world than that. I first heard it on Tin Cup. What a great flick. I saw Boyz in the Hood last night for the first time in years. Outside of the young boy giving the Reagan Bush '84 sign the bird, the movie was spectacular. Funny how there were riots in Los Angeles on the night of the movie's premier. That seems odd. The movie is very sympathetic to the myriad of problems in South Central, LA and automatically, there is public outcry. That's like riots in Scotland when Braveheart was released (Didnt happen, but serves as a sarcastic counter point. The best movie of all time maybe Braveheart, but the best movie of last year was Jerry Maguire, hands down. Good love story and date flick. I recommend it to anyone who reads my babble here. Furthermore, it is imperative to realize the implications and the modifications of absolutely nothing. I just like typing implications and modifications. Do do do a da da da. Theme of a funny commercial I saw yesterday, one of the many considering how bored I was. Slothfulness can certainly be enjoyable, though "
Tell me about yourself.,"Okay, now is the time -- I usually don't have trouble writing for a long period of time - at least typing, because I think I type faster than I write. I am continuously writing e-mails to people. In fact, one semester I was even addicted to the Internet!  I was always on it. I wasn't as bad as my roommate at the time thought he never even went to class!  I couldn't believe it. At least I knew to be addicted at nighttime!  Anyway - I enjoy typing and I really enjoy writing my thoughts. This stream of consciousness reminds me of my senior year in high school when we got to read James Joyce in my English class. It was the best book I read all year - the Portrait of the Artis as a Young Man - does this computer have a way to skip to the next line, or do I do that myself?  Well - I shall do it myself. OK - anyway - about Stephen Dedalus - in James Joyce. The entire book was written the way I am writing this essay. I guess it is an essay -- I always thought they were spelled like S. A. !  but - that seems stupid when you think about it. Psychology really seems interesting. But - I know the tests are hard. I am graduating in December and I have always wanted to take Psy. I just never had the time when it came to  my major and all the government, etc. classes I had to take. I can't wait to  graduate. There is so much red tape at this institution. Yesterday - just to add into a class that wasn't even full - My God. You would think the class is controlled by Zeus himself!  I had to fill out forms - and then I had to make inquiries and get permission from the professor. Just so I could take Accounting 310f for Non- Business majors that isn't even a grade for me since I am taking it pass/fail. Now does that not sound stupid. Sometimes I think education has become too much like government. Not enough quality - just a lot of  quantity of BS where nothing is really ever accomplished. The status quo just seems to prevail. I think that is terrible. but -if you think about it - it makes sense. This institution cares not if I get a good education- but rather if I am able to  jump through all the hoops it places before me. Whether I can read the fine print and take all the courses and get all the red tape cut before I graduate. Is that what the college experience should be about?  I guess college prepares  a person for life. Not in the classes taken per se - but in the lifestyle of the student. So - if I understand that life is simply college magnified, and if I can jump through all the hoops placed before me in college and actually graduate with my 120 hours, then maybe life won't be as complicated and difficult. The question then becomes if life gets more simple and less strenuous and frustrated, then shouldn't college follow in suit?  Since I don't believe that will ever happen, I guess the college is here to stay. If anything - college prepares a person for graduate school!  Law school, oy - a Yiddish expression - I can't wait for that!  I am taking a course now on constitutional law by Dr. Perry. I absolutely love it. - It mystifies me, the Constitution. What does is cover - what responsibilities does it have. How does one know?  All these questions can be answered and asked in this class. There are only 10 people in the class - compared to the 500 or so in PSy. class, I would say that's pretty good!  I think I figured out how to do these lines on this computer I just have to push return before getting to the end of the line instead of  writing one line to eternity. How does the TA actually know that I spent 20  minutes on this?  What if I simply type really fast and I get more words on the screen than the next guy?  What if I say -- well, it's only been 5 minutes but - I gotta go?  Who ever thought of that movie with Woody Allen about the future and sex is regulated!  DAMN!  I promised myself to write about everything in the world not having anything to do with sex. I thought that for 20 minutes  I could think of not having sex. Damn. I guess I am just a typical 21 year old guy who can't get his mind out of the gutter. that really upsets me I always thought I could be more than the average Joe. Well - that shall be for my next paper on the college experience. Boy - are y'all gonna love that  or what?!!  GOTTA GO NOW -- THE PROFESSOR IS CALLING ME!!!  "
Tell me about yourself.,I wish it was Friday actually I wish it was next Friday then I would be going home vacuums really bug me I want to change the channel but I don't want to get up but duck tales really sucks and even though Im not even watching it and just hearing it bugs me I guess that's something you just have to deal with if you're lazy I want to talk to Stephen but I dont want to call him because I called last but he hasn't called me which really doesn't make much sense but guys don't make any sense anyway so its ok I don't want to go to calculus tomorrow but I should because Ive already missed it twice I wish it would rain I want to get caught in the rain I want some Dr pepper but I dont want to go buy some because I don't want to spend the money I want to get an exhaust even though I haven't even found anybody to race up here I should write to Christina I need to check the mail who cares about the kennedys I hope I have some mail but I really doubt it I never get mail my room looks so boring I don't like living in a dorm it really sucks but I guess this is better than jester it's kind of hard to think and write at the same time I hate typing why are her clothes still hanging there what's wrong with using the dryer I need to do laundry double your pleasure double your fun my boobs itch I guess I shouldn't have tanned for so long     
Tell me about yourself.,"It is late and I need to get so sleep but I trying to stay awake writing  this assignment. I am so glad I finish the English paper. I can now relax  for about two before he gives us another one. I hope I'll be able to wake  up tomorrow to go to class at nine in the morning. I hate English the most. Writing paper gives me a headache. What the hell is Quyen listening to. I glad I got a lot done today. I can't wait till next weekend comes back  around. Maybe next weekend I be able to relax and not have to work. Just ten  more minutes and I will be done. This writing assignment is stupid but I am  glad it is easy. It not so bad. My back hurts. I should take so Tylenol. Maybe it will help. Shit, I forgot I have a reading assignment in biology. After this, I am going to take a shower and climb straight to bed. Working and going to school is getting real tiring. I am hunger but I am also very  sleepy. There probably nothing in the fringe to eat anyway. That reminds  me I need to go to the store tomorrow. Maybe I'll get some real healthy  food this time. My eyes are dry. I need to take out my contacts. I think has been twenty minutes now so I'll stop here. "
Tell me about yourself.,"When I first decided to go back to school I knew from my current job at Texas School for the Blind that I wanted to enrich my knowledge in the fields  of the social and psychological sciences. I soon realized that most of the more detailed social science classes required PSY 301. This brings us to the present. I have always had a strong interest in the ways and whys of peoples reactions to life. Since I was a young girl people have come to me for answers to questions on their lives or advice of different content. Supplying folks with this help has never over taxed my own brain and I have even found it to be very rewarding. I always chalked my natural abilities up to my own experiences as a child. I was ordered by law to see a psychologist because of the fighting of my parents over my sister and myself. I did the Rohrshac(inkblot test) , the what do you see in the clouds thing and many other ""buzz"" tests of the day (circa mid 1970's). Anyway, these test never showed my little 5,6,7, and 8 year old psyche to be under too much mental duress and I was an above average student at school. I even skipped lessons in 1st grade and was moved to 2nd because I knew how to read. However, since the death of my father last year and the pre-grieving of watching someone be taken by AIDS, my need to make heads or tails out of some of the reasons and whys my own life has unfolded as it has , has become an intensified desire I must look further into. "
Tell me about yourself.,"As I sit her and begin this assignment so many things come to mind. I feel overwhelmed with things I need to do, but I'm glad I'm getting this assignment completed at last. My watch is bugging me it continues to hit against the desk. If I only could get and stay comfortable I could get so much more done. I feel  like I make to many excuses, yet I always get done what I need to get done. I miss home, not completely. I don't want to be there now, for no one is there friend wise really, but I just miss the security. I can't wait till I'm busier here at school. There is so much I want to do. There is a smudge on my computer screen, just enough that the words beneath it are  a little blurred. I wonder where the name Bevo came for the mascot of UT. Names are so funny. I mean who comes up with them. My name is strange and unique. People always ask me how I got it. I know it is derived from my grandfather's name, but I don't know how they logistically came up with it. Is Logistically a word. I doubt it . I'm always coming up with words like that.  I had the best weekend. It was a lot of fun. I got to spend some time with friends I hadn't seen in a while. I only wish it wasn't so rushed. We were constantly doing stuff. I just wanted to hang out and chill, but Oh no we had to party non-stop. I don't drink so I feel as if I'm not always that much fun. I know that is stupid. But that's how I feel.  Feelings are so weird they suck sometimes and are awesome other times. They are so demanding. I mean whatever you are feeling takes so much energy be it positive or negative. I feel lonely now. But I'm glad. I need to spend time with myself. but I'm the kind of person that can't stand being alone. That's something I'm going to have to work on.  I played soccer in high school. But I had surgery my senior year and couldn't play. I kinda want to play again, but I'm worried I'll suck since it has been so long. I cant believe I've used the word, ""suck"" so many times that is so rude and un-lady like. excuse me. Well I don't even know who I'm apologizing to. I just know if my mother knew I used that word she would have a few words with me.  I just realized I need to flip my calendar. I can't believe it is already Sept. It seams like just yesterday summer was here. I'm not as good of a typist as I used to be, I keep hitting the wrong keys, or should I say striking the wrong keys.   Typing is a lot like playing the piano you strike keys in a planed out order to create something. It's kind of neat when you think about it. Everything is like that. A lot of little things put together is what creates the whole picture, piece of music or art. I can't wait to get married. Well that's not true. I can wait to get married but I can't wait to find My soul mate. I believe God intended for us to only be with one person, and that person was created for us, just like we were created for them. Well anyway I can't wait to meet him. I miss my cat. I remember the professor mentioned writing about our animals, and that made me think of my cat. I love him. He is so cute and inviting, I don't think he has ever met a stranger, or an enemy. It would be nice if there were more people like that.  I hope I don't get that carpal tunnel disease or whatever from typing incorrectly, that would not be good. I miss my friends, but most of all my best friend he is so awesome, but he's not dealing with this whole separation thing well, or maybe I'm not dealing with it well and he is doing just fine. Either way I'm not happy with the situation. I think I have the wrong edition book for my psychology book. I hope it doesn't make a difference. I guess I will find out tomorrow. A rose is so beautiful. I just spotted a picture of one. It is so symbolic. How It's beauty is dangerous to the touch. An important lesson to be learned and cherished, well I've been at this for just over twenty minutes now so I think I'll call it quits. But his was fun. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, I'm not really sure what types of things I'm supposed to be saying. I miss my boyfriend so much. I hope he has a safe trip home. I hope he doesn't fall asleep. I feel really sleepy myself. I hope I can stay awake for this twenty minutes. Time seems to go by so slowly when you're sleepy. Especially when school work is involved. I wish I was a better typer. It is so hard to just think normally when you're typing on a computer. People probably think I'm not a very interesting person. I try to be, but I think I was born to be boring. Be boring and study my life away. I really don't mean to be so studious. I mean I want to do well in school, but I think I'm too caught up in it. Everything makes me nervous. It is so strange because even though I know this isn't going to be ""graded"", I feel nervous about doing it wrong or not doing a good job. I miss my family and my friends. I don't think I appreciated them enough when I was home. It is so hard to build a friendship up from scratch. It took years to be so close to them, and now I have to start all over. I'm truly lucky to have people that share all of my memories and understand all of my feelings. I wonder if they miss me as much as I miss them. I'm so paranoid. I'm always concerned that people are deceiving me in relationships. What if they don't mean ""love"" in the same way that I do?  I hate being hurt. I like to be in control and be omniscient. I like to have the upper hand with people. Unfortunately,  I think most of the time I'm the vulnerable one. Is that normal?  Probably. If I tell myself that enough I might believe it. Could someone really love someone enough that they would die for them if they had to. So many songs make that claim. It must be a truly amazing love. I am still in awe when I think about what Jesus did for me and everyone else. He died a most humiliating and painful death so we wouldn't have to. What love!  How sad though to think that not everyone accepts it!  I feel so guilty when talking to someone that doesn't accept it. I feel like there is something I could say to solve it, but I just don't know what. I know I'm not doing everything I could for Christ, and therefore not being quite good enough. I know I can't be perfect, but I try so hard to be. It feels that I come up short a lot in my life. It is so stressful. I'm probably going to die at an early age because of it. I can't stop though. Kale is so wonderful. He would do anything for me. I can't imagine anyone loving me that much unless they have to. My parents have to, but he doesn't. It is amazing. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now I'm sitting in the computer lab at my dorm. I'm really bored and really want to get this writing assignment out of the way. The direction say that I should type for 20 minutes. I have 18 minutes to go. I'm a really slow typist. I was just watching TV with my roommate and then I came down here to check my e-mail. My dad sent me a really sweet message. I really miss him but I'm really not homesick. I'm having a lot of fun up here at school and meeting a lot of new people. I really like all of my classes. Okay, fifteen minutes to go. My ankle really hurts because I sprained it. There were some girls in here that would not shut up and they were really getting on my nerves. One of them just hit my chair as she was leaving and didn't even apology. The letter after y on this key board will not work. Okay, I'm supposed to be living in a really nice dorm and this computer won't even work right. Oh well. I fell really bad for my roommate because she and her mom got in a fight tonight and she was crying when I came home and stuff. She really is a nice person and we get along really well. Only 11 more minutes to go. Well, I'm really excited about the football game this weekend. My friends went and got tickets for me and my roommate to sit with them. We are on the fifty yard line on the first row. I can't wait. My parents are leaving for Maine in about two weeks. They have a huge trip planned to New York, Washington, Maine, Boston, and somewhere else. I'm really excited for them. They need some time to get away. My dad really works too hard so this will be a time for them to relax and have some fun. They just celebrated their twenty-seventh anniversary. I think that is really cool and I admire them for being so happily married for so long. My roommate just came in to check her e-mail. I wonder if she has any. She is now e-mailing one of her friends. I wonder if Keith will call me back tonight. I hope that he is not too mad at me. I guess I find out soon enough. I had so much fun this past weekend. I spent the weekend with my four friends that have an apartment here in Austin. My roommate went home for the weekend so I just hung out with them. We had a BBQ one night and watched movies and went swimming and laid in the hot tub and just relaxed. It was so much fun. I think that I'll spend this weekend with them again. Gabe kissed me this past weekend and I really don't know what to think. He calls me a lot now to check on me and to make sure I get home okay and to see what I'm doing and stuff. We've been friends for a long time so I really don't know what to think. Well, my twenty minutes if officially up, so see ya later.      "
Tell me about yourself.,"My mind is totally blank right now. I am just happy that got in the computer lab and was able to use a computer without a long wait. I am kind of lost as to what  to write. I am thinking about how much time I have to pass before my next class  starts and I am wondering what to do to make the time go faster. I saw one of my  friends from high school today. I am happy that I finally saw a familiar face. Why is that light blinking on the CD-ROM door? I did not put a CD in the drive. I hope I doing this assignment right. I want a new day planner. I am tired of  looking at that Nike symbol on mine. I want a leather one but my parents don't think I should $50 for a day planner, so oh well there goes that. I need to paint my fingernails. They are so plain looking. I think I might paint them tonight, oh no  I can't. I have precal homework to do. I need go and have them painted and maybe  I can treat my mom also. She needs to pamper herself. This chair is quite comfortable. I like how the back gives in when you lean back. I need this for my computer at home. There are a lot of Dell computer boxes in the corner of this room. I wonder how many are there. I wonder if the MTV music awards are going to be good tonight. I missed the awards last year. I don't even who won. I hope its not raining right now or when I am ready to  leave. My hair will frizz so bad and I'll have to blow-dry it out to make it smooth again. I wish I could where my hair naturally curly but its just too frizzy. My niece has the best hair and her mother doesn't take care of it. What are doors to side of this room for?   Where do they lead?  My hands are cold. My feet are cold, too. I wonder if this shirt makes me look fat. The stripes are going horizontal. I need to start back to exercising like I used to. That boy is kinda cute who just walked by. My finger are really cold. The air conditioning must be up pretty high in here. I am always colder than most people. Maybe I have small blood vessels in my hands and feet or something. I just can't get over how Princess Diana died. She seemed to  be such nice person. What is this black cord wrapped around the bottom of the monitor?  What is it used for?  I am sleepy and I have another class to go to today. I hope I perk up. I 'e never seen a window button on a computer before but then I've never used a Dell computer before either. How wide are the margins on this sheet. I'm try to keep my typing neat. I always like things to be neat and organized. My mind is blank again. I wonder what my mom is cooking today if she is cooking. My back is itching. I just realized that my legs are sore from that walking I did yesterday from the Robert L. Moore Building all the way to Calhoun hall in the six pack. My legs shouldn't be sore. I was a cheerleader in junior high and high school. My pen is coming out of my day planner. I never really fit right anyway. My day planner is  kind of different. maybe I don't need another one. Maybe I've been around my parents too long, but then my mom is my best friend. I tell her everything since I don't have a sister. My brother hasn't taken me to the  movies in a long time. I wonder how he and his wife are doing. How do leave this computer lab. I guess the same way I got in. My handwriting is terrible. I hate having to write checks or sign my name. I just can't make my  handwriting flow like some peoples. I think I drank too much sprite. All that ice might be making my hands and  feet cold. I need to go and warm up. This air conditioning is really chilling me. I should paint my nails red like I have my toes. I need to go read for my Ancient Greek class. I haven't read the Odyssey since the ninth grade. Maybe I will understand it better this time. I only remember the Cyclops. My hands are too cold. I  need to warm up a bit.     "
Tell me about yourself.,"Okay, I just started writing or well I guess typing. I am still kind of emotionless because I just woke up. You know how when you first wake up and you just need to go to the bathroom but after that you don't know what to do. I'm not hungry or thirsty or anything. I am kind of cold though, because the fan is right over my head. I have a pretty good feeling because I got to this page alot easier than I thought I would. Right now the only thing I really think about is a situation I am in. I am dating this guy and he's really great, but he keeps asking where our relationship is going and I don't really know. The big problem is that this guy I dated off and on for over a year is about to be transferred (he's in the Army) to Kaline which is pretty close to here and he calls and writes but never asks if I am seeing anyone new. I don't know if this is because he doesn't care and just wants to be friends or if he just assumes that I am waiting for him. Knowing him he will probably expect me to drop anyone I happen to be involved with as soon as he moves down here. This is something I normally would not mind doing, but I really like this guy I am dating so I don't know what to do. My bathroom is making the weirdest noise right now. I probably need to have that checked out. I am having to shift positions right now because I am not very comfortable and my neck is starting to hurt. Now my nose itches so I have to rub it. My room is a huge mess because they just set up my computer and won't let me throw away any of the boxes so they are piled up in my room until I have the chance to take them home. My hands are starting to shake a little so I must be getting hungry. My roommate should be getting back from class pretty soon and maybe she will make me something to eat. I kind of don't like it when she is in the kitchen though because she tends to make a pretty large mess and it tends to take her a few days to clean it up. You can't really say anything to her because she gets real defensive and it starts a fight. I really miss my cat, Black Jack, I have had her since I was two and she is BEAUTIFUL!!!  I think my twenty minutes are about up and I am really hungry, so I'm going to end this. BYE!!   "
Tell me about yourself.,"I wanted to write about something traumatic that happened to me because, apparently, traumatic experiences and how to deal with them is a pretty big fandango in this class. Something just happened, though, so I want to write about that and see where it takes me in the next nineteen minutes or so. The computer assistant in the theatre department (where I am right now, being a theatre major and all) just complimented me on my hat, a black fedora I bought in Greenwich Village about a year and a half ago. I was visiting for about a week over spring break and auditioning for the elusive Experimental Theatre wing of NYU's Tisch School of the Arts. After a fairly successful audition I concentrated all of my efforts of exploring, something I had done about seven or eight months earlier the first time I visited. This time I was alone, though. The time before I had my brother, eighteen months my junior and my closest friend, at my side and all was well. This time I had to w2ait a couple of days for his arrival, since he couldn't get off school and I could, being a senior and having a few excused absence ""college days"" on my hands. So I set out to explore and found a bar in the mob district of Little Italy that didn't ID and I found myself drunkenly wandering the streets of New York, stumbling upon Strawberry Fields in a haze and not realizing the significance until about a week later. After three days of being lost in my drugged little haze my brother joined me. When I picked him up at the airport I noticed that I had taken to thinking of myself as a New Yorker. I had adopted the city and there was a definite change in the way my brother and I related to each other. This changed over the next four days, though, as he assimilated into New York the way I had and we set out to Little Italy to begin our evenings with a little pasta, a Nat King Cole impersonator, a jug of white wine every night, and a restaurant owned by the mob.  After taking in as much of the culture and the underbelly of the city we found ourselves down to our last (having just dropped twenty bucks on some Thai food that smelled like sewer filth). It was our second to last day in the city and we decided to thrift store shop and try to extend our dollars as far as they would go. Then we saw them. In a small shop in the Village (not that there aren't a billion of them) we both saw fedoras that just said ""you"". We ended up dropping our last fifty dollars on our new hats and had to pay for our ride to the airport ( a limo, surprisingly cheaper than a taxi because it had a set fare) with a handful of quarters. We hadn't eaten for two days and there wasn't a meal of any kind on the plane (not even peanuts) so we wound up in Houston on a two hour layover with nothing to do, empty stomachs, and no money. I ended up begging, trying to sell a stack of demo tapes I had cut for two bucks a pop. I ended up selling two, and we ate the best Taco Bell that has ever been eaten by a human. I remember that the only people who bought the tapes were other musicians. Maybe it's a karma thing (""Wow, that guy looks pathetic. Better buy his tape because that could be me someday. "")  One way or the other they understood. I was upset just because my plan was to randomly hand out this stack of tapes to people as they departed for different corners of the country, hoping that they would like it and that underground distribution would abound. Maybe it worked: I still don't know. I know it was passed around quite a bit in south Texas, but not much further than that. Oh, well. By the by, I'm really tired right now because my band played a two hour show last night. We haven't played that long in about a year, since clubs usually limit you to an hour or less. We used to go two hours without even trying when we were playing for our friend's parties, but now we've gotten lazy. Last night really woke us up. I was so drenched in sweat that I actually had to wring out my shirt after the show. We didn't even get a decent crowd until the last thirty minutes or so. That's ok. Better things will come along soon enough. We play every Thursday at Black Cat, which has no cover and is all ages. For some reason, this alone does not attract a crowd. It's really upsetting. I know we're not a bad band, so it's really frustrating when you can't talk people out of disco dancing at Bob Popular to enjoy a free show that accepts all ages and doesn't involve a DJ. Someday. About that traumatic experience. About five months ago I was hit by a car while I was crossing the street into Trudy's off Guadalupe. It was late and I was wearing all black and the guy didn't see me. I was looking the other way because I saw the car that hit me but he seemed too far away to reach me. I was more concerned about cars coming from the other direction, which is a curving road that is hard to see down. When he hit me his fender shattered my leg and I was thrown onto his windshield. He didn't brake until then and the force of him braking as I hit the windshield sent me flying into the road about twenty feet out. I never lost consciousness and never really felt all that dazed or affected by it. I just calmly looked up, announced that my ""fucking leg was broken"" and asked one of my friends to call 911. Then I just lay down in the road waiting for the ambulance. It started to rain. That night I was taken to Brackenridge and left alone for about an hour at a time in the ER. Only one of my friends cam to visit me. She held my hand while they pieced my leg back together and set it into a cast. They had already pumped me with morphine and I heard them mumble about amputation a time or two, but eventually they settled on inserting a rod from my knee to my ankle. The morphine did nothing to me, though, because they gave it in light doses and after years of recreational drug use I wasn't really affected. That and the pain was coming from the one part of my body where intravenous drugs couldn't possibly go. I ended up just biting down on a folded-up blanket, not wanted my screams to disturb others in the ER. Over the next three days I was observed and recovered quicker than anyone imagined. My family came to be with me from San Antonio, except for my dad who was in Orlando on business. He wanted to rush to Austin to be with me but I didn't want him to see me tied up to machines and weak. I knew he couldn't handle it. After about a half hour of coaxing he stayed in Orlando. He hasn't had a drop of alcohol in twenty years after getting a kidney removed before I was born. That night he drank himself into submission. Slowly my friends from the theatre department began creeping in until I had a steady stream of visitors and a room full of flowers, candy, and porn (don't ask). The faculty came to make sure that I was alright, something I never would've expected, and one night my nurse ( a Mary Poppins sort of woman) turned my bed so that I could see the tower lit up in orange. I've never had school spirit or pride in any organization whatsoever, but for some reason I cried. For some reason I loved the sight of the tower at that moment. I've recovered completely. I was angry for a while and spent a lot of time screaming and damning anyone who could walk while I made my way around in a wheelchair. I marveled at the fact that, even when I was on crutches, nice families at the Arboretum would still pull their children closer and hold their purses tighter. I began to keep a journal, but by the time I had written five entries my anger was gone. My depression was gone. I couldn't even dwell of death, which I know I had cheated. I was just glad to be alive and to put it all behind me. Now I'm physically and emotionally recovered. I don't have nightmares and I don't fear cars. I don't know why. Maybe I'll learn that this semester. For some reason I recovered very nicely in all aspects from this whole awful little episode.  The good thing is that I'm happy and sober now. I had attempted suicide twice this past year, once just two weeks before the accident. Then I was put in a situation where I didn't try and death actually came for me, and I fought to stay alive. That's always struck me as odd. Oh well. For whatever reason I am a happier, if quieter person. Things are good. I'm looking forward to psychological experiments this year. Now I'm off. I've written for about thirty minutes and I think it's time for a cigarette. Bye bye now.   "
Tell me about yourself.,Today was a good day I enjoy life. I wish I was at home with my girlfriend. she is so pretty I am in love yet it is not here. I wish that she could be here to join me. Frat life is demanding yet it should be a good payoff in the near future I wish I could sleep I am so tired that it is hard to stay awake at times during the day I really enjoy this kind valentine assignment it lets me express my true feelings  and thoughts with no real worries except that if it will arrive when it needs to. 20 minutes is a long time to write continuously but it really is neat to think off all the things that go on in my head. like home and vlentina. that is her name the lovely girl that I left back home when I came to college. I am scared that I will not do as well as I can I hope so I dont want to let me dad down he is very important to me even though he is a bit scary at times. but that is how they are supposed to be right? oh well I hope my dog is doing ok I love her so my thoughts drift now into wanting to be on some other planet that is why I love astronomy. even thought it is kind confusing. but it is fun nonetheless I love to use the internet I think that it is so neat. I do however wish I could find a good use for it. all I ever do is waste time going from place to place not knowing where I am going. kinda like life we seem to wander from place to place and never seem to  truly settle down at least that is the way things seem right now in a few years  however I am sure that my opinion will change. I know that once I can complete college which is my number one goal above all else. then to have fun and party. I hope this week we will have a good party I know we will. we always have the best parties. and there  are always girls there. yet I do wish that valentina could be there. even though  she did start to bother me before I left. now it seems that we have gotten closer at the same time that we are apart. is she the girl for me? I do not know and whish  that I did. it seems that way at times. yet then at other times she just bugs me to death an \d all I can think of is getting away from her. I never want to loose her though. I do really care for her. I am looking forward to seeing here soon on my birthday she will stay with me I hope. but I will probably not see her that much since I am so  busy I guess I will just have to make the time to see her. I hope that she loves me I really do. I miss my parents and my old room. my room i\ here is great and I have  fun with my roommates all of whom are from my home in fort worth. so we get along well not like some of the girls that came here boy they cant stand each other and we have only  been here for 3 weeks. not even a full month. I cant believe I am writing this much I normally cannot write this much when working on a paper but now I can I guess I dont really have to think about what I am writing just write it. I think that it is neat . wow that was a fast 20 minutes. I can't believe that it is over oh well I still have on more assignment to do. 
Tell me about yourself.,"Yuck, what a cruddy day. I had to go to 4 hours of classes and then I had to wait 30 minutes for the freaking bus to pick us up. Then I had to stand up for most of the ride home. And it was really hot on the bus. Luckily today wasn't too hot outside though. I saw on the news that we are expecting some rain and cooler weather. That's good. I guess. I don't know about the rain part though. I hope I can find my umbrella. I hope I didn't lose it when I moved up here. I live in a really neat apartment now. I like it a lot. And my roommate is really nice too. I was kind of worried about that. I transferred here from A&M this semester. I like it here. But it's not really any different than in College Station. Just bigger. My classes aren't any harder so far. I hate calculus. I'm usually pretty good at math. I think it's also because my TA that teaches our discussion is horrible. He hardly speaks English and doesn't know what he's doing at all. Of course I dont' really know what I'm doing at all either but. Wow 20 minutes is a long time. Lots of random stuff kind of floats through your head. Like the fact that I can see that I have email and I really want to check it. I just checked it before I started writing, I guess somebody wrote back. I wonder who. Probably Amy. Amy was supposed to transfer this year too and be my roommate but she forgot to send in her transcript. She's kind of spacey about stuff like that. But she's like the sweetest person I know. Actually I don't really know a lot of people here. That's kind of sad considering I knew practically everyone at my high school and I had a lot of friends at A&M. My roommate at A&M just rushed a sorority this year. Neither one of us rushed last year. I'm happy for her. I wonder if I shouldve rushed this year. Then Id know more people. But my boyfriend goes to school here. But he doesnt know that many people here either. The year just started so I guess I'll meet more people as it goes by. I need to go workout tonight. I haven't worked out really well in a few days. I feel much better and more relaxed after I work out. I'm still feeling kind of stressed after my gross day. I have a lot of homework to do and a lot of other things on my list. I always make lists. I wonder what that says about a persons personality. I'm really organized and like to plan things. Maybe that's part of it. Strange. I wanted to plan a trip to go tubing in San Marcos before school started but we never got around to it. I hate how my boyfriend makes fun of me and says that I never plan anything. I know he's just kidding, but it gets on my nerves. He just doesn't understand I guess. Wow I just got a weird flashback of high school. I was a cheerleader and I just thought of some performance we did. I wonder where that came from. My typing has gotten really good over the past year. I used to not be that great. I think all the emailing made me better. I wonder who that email is from?  I haven't seen a lot of the people that I know here. I guess I should call them and get together. I feel like I don't have time though. I have to do homework, and work out and I need time to myself just to vege. Speaking of vegetables, I need to go to the grocery store too. I need vegetables, noodles, rice, chicken, cookies, hmm what else?  Milk. I like milk, especially with my cereal. I need more cereal too. I always want to get pancake mix. yummy. only a few minutes left. That's good because my back-neck-shoulder is starting to hurt from sitting at this computer. I need to get a cable so I can hook up my printer. Not that I need it yet but I should get that taken care of. My mom said she is sending me a package with cookies and candy and my last paycheck from work (lifeguard)and other stuff. that is something to look forward to. I haven't gotten any mail lately. I paid my rent today. through January. I need to call my bank and have them transfer some money form my savings into my checking. or else we could have some problems. but my grandfather is the president of the bank and my aunt is the CEO so I don't think that they'd let me bounce a check. That's going to be a shock when I have to go out and get  a real job and find a real bank. Time's up. Yea!   "
Tell me about yourself.,"This is really strange. I have never had to do anything like this assignment in my life. Actually the only time I ever use a computer is to play solitaire. I took a couple of computer classes in high school but never learned anything about the internet. I went after class today to set up the computer account but the office had already shut down. I was able to set up an e-mail address but I just learned that I can't do much with it just yet. I never set up an account with the university so I can't check my mail from the apartment just yet. I came into the computer lab in my apartment complex and fortunately a guy in here kind of helped me to understand what is going on with the computer situation. He let me use his account to do this writing assignment with one restriction-I can't do anything illegal while I am logged into his account. The funny thing is I would not know if I was doing anything illegal because I know nothing about computers. I think before I go to class tomorrow I am going to set up my account at school. Maybe the people in the Hogg building will have some handouts for the ""computer illiterate"". I wonder if I am the first person to do this assignment. Probably not, there was only about 500 people in my class and I am sure someone has done the assignment by now. I figured I should do it ASAP so I won't fall behind in my homework assignments. I was a pretty good student in high school but then again I was always reminded when assignments were due. I already have post-it notes all over my room to remind me of the things I have to do for all my classes. There is a pool right outside of the computer lab I am sitting at and I am thinking I may have to go swimming. I think I will invite some friends over to keep me company. It is really cold in here and my fingers are beginning to freeze up. I am in here alone. The song to ""Friends"" is playing loudly on the TV in the sitting room next door. A girl who works in the office just shut the door and said ""Good Night"". It is quieter now and I am beginning to run out of things to type about. I talked to my boyfriend right before I came over here. He goes to Ole Miss in Mississippi. I haven't talked to him in a few days so it was nice to hear his voice. He has an e-mail address so I think I am going to attempt to e-mail him. I wonder if anyone will read all of this stuff I just wrote. I think with over 1000 entries due it is not too likely someone is going to read this entry. Oh well I have written a little longer than the set amount of time - ""Little"" being the key word. I am sure with all of the computer technology whoever checks this assignment will know exactly how long I have been typing. I suppose after I set up my account at school I will be able to write my second assignment. I will talk to you then!!  TRICIA VERONA  "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well I'm finally doing this writing assignment. It was not in my mind at all so I totally forgot about this stuff. This assignment is taking me back to the seventh grade because in my English class. damn I keep messing up on my typing. well back to what I was talkin about. We had to write at the beginning of every class for five or ten minutes about anything that came to our mind; of course if we didnt wanna write a story or something. So what I would write a lot is something like ""I think this writing assignment sucks, . its stupid. and Im bored. I'm bored. "", on and on and on. I also just would like keeping writing the alphabet in random order. Well now I'm listening to this tired ass song from Puff Daddy, ""Ill Be Missin You""  It talks about death of a friend. To me that is very scary. Cuz I always imagine how it would feel when you die or like where do you go. Its just a scary feelin that you dont know when we might not be here anymore. I had a few people that I knew die. Its just a sad thought. Now Im thinking about how college isnt that bad. Only if it wasnt for me being lost in Calculus. I mean I shouldnt have any trouble; I was Valedictorian and I feel very stupid, upset, frustrated, and scared. Oh shit. I just flinched cuz I got startled by the fact that some guy across the hall here just slammed the door very, very hard. Two times and said ""jack ass"" so loud that I heard him while Im sittin here typing in my dorm room. Well I need to start getting on the ball and do all my reading and homework, especially in Calculus. For some odd reason its just not clicking for me. and math is supposedly one of my best subjects. I guess that was in high school. and I even took calc. last year. Oh, now the Men In Black song is playing. I think that that movie wasn't as good as it was in the previews. So now I dont really have anything else to talk about. Actually I cant wait to talk about my college experience cuz boy do I have some problems right now. Oh damn there's a phone call and I got up to get it but I dont know what happened. Well Im going to be going home tomorrow so Im not going to the UT vs. Rutgers on Sat. I think Im gonna go to the library in a few minutes after I finish writing on here. Im actually finished so I guess Im Out. PEACE. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I can't believe I am doing this, and that I actually am getting through it, because this is the first time that I have ever logged on to the world wide web, at least I think that is what you call it. To tell you the truth it is actually easier than I thought it would be, I expected it to be very difficult, but it's not all that bad. Anyhow all this computer stuff is fairly new to me and so it is rather confusing for me at times. But I guess I am coping with it and handling it the best I can. Though I am always afraid that I will hit one button and the whole place will shut down. Actually, that is a true nightmare that I have had before. Which reminds me that I have been having really strange dreams lately, and all of them concern a different aspect of school. Which I guess is because I have just moved here from a really small town. And when I say small, I mean really , really small, like about fifteen hundred people in the whole town. Now compared to that Austin is a real shocker. I guess it just takes some getting used to , and learning new things when you move from a farm to a fast paced city. So many things are different and yet so many things are the same. A funny thing happened when I first moved here a week ago, I found out that my cousin, she is the same age as me, is living in the apartment directly above mine. to me this is such a coincidence, really when you think about it is. Just think of how many apartment buildings there are in Austin, and I unknowingly chose the exact same one that she did. And she and I only used to see each other once a year, but now we see each other nearly every day. Christmas, when our families all got together was the only time we saw each other,  I am already looking forward to the Christmas season because of the weather that we have at that time. I am so tired of this ninety degree weather. I can't wait for a cold spell or a norther to blow in and cool everything off. But I guess that won't happen for a while yet anyway. That reminds me that I have to pick up a raincoat or an umbrella before this weekend, because I am planning to go to my youngest brothers football game, and I want to be prepared in case it happened to rain. More than likely it won't rain, but I know that If I don't get a raincoat or umbrella then sure enough it will pour. I don't usually enjoy watching football games, actually I don't ever enjoy watching it, but my brother begged me and begged me to come see him, so I finally told him that we would come watch him this Friday. he's supposed to be really good. But I don't even remember what position he plays anymore. The reason that I don't really like football is that I don't understand the rules very well, and I think that if I knew them better then I would be able to follow along with the game better and enjoy it much more. I am not much of a person who likes sports and athletics much anyway. I like to do more calm, less active things. One of my really good friends happens to be getting married this weekend. I wonder what the wedding will be like, considering the man she is marrying is so strange. I wonder how long that marriage will last. But I am glad to be going to her wedding, because I will be able to see all of my old friends from high school again, and catch up with what they are doing now. I haven't seen them is a really long time so that should be interesting. Well, I am way past my twenty minutes, and must get to class, so I must end here. "
Tell me about yourself.,"alright. what can I talk about. well the only thing Im really thinking about is richie. I love him so much. ok why can I now see what Im typing. anyway, I g "
Tell me about yourself.,"Hi my name is Brandi and I am writing this assignment, mainly cuz you told me too. Right now I am really tired and worried about my grandfather who happens to be in the hospital right now. I feel stupid writing about absolutely nothing just what I think about and since that is what I was thinking that is what I typed. I am really wondering when this line is going to end cuz it is pretty darn long. I wonder what my boyfriend is doing at the University of ATM right now. I wonder if he misses me or forgot about me. though I know that he didn't forget about me. I mean who would I am an unforgettable person. This apartment/dorm is so terribly hot. I haven't figured out how to work the air conditioner yet. I believe that it is broke, my room mate can't figure it out either. Let's see I have wrote for about 5 whole minutes so far, and this is a lot harder than it sounds. Let's see what can I do this weekend. Hummmm. there is the football game, a party I was invited too, go home (which I dont see happening), go see my grandfather (which I am not real sure about doing), or study. I believe I will take options one, two, and four. I dont want to see my grandfather because I hate to be around sad situations. they depress me and I hate to feel sad or depressed. I figure I can make myself that way why put myself into that situation. I love my grandfather but I dont want to go there. There is also the fact that if I dont acknowledge it then it might not be true. that is the way I think. If I dont see it then it doesn't happen. illogical but it works for me. My friend just came over and I let her in she is now washing my dishes, she is one of my best friends and I have known her since kindergarten, but boy can we get on each others nerves. Not kidding because we really do. We have gotten to be like sisters almost especially this past summer and we just were around each other too much. And when we argue it is usually over irrelevant things, or really really stupid things. We also argue over the race issue. she is black and I am white, that is one issue that can really tick me off. I dont understand how people can be so stupid and childish. Why should we look at race instead of the people. that issue really makes me mad. I really have completely nothing to say at all. I did receive a letter well email from my boyfriend today and it really made me happy. he told me that he missed me. It had been awhile since I have seen him but hopefully he will be able to come see me this weekend on Sunday since there is a STUPID football game on Saturday. I really miss him and wish he was coming here but it makes me happy when I hear from him and see him. I guess since I am a female one of the most lovable things I like to do is hug someone, but only at certain times. cuz when I am sad, it will make me cry in a heartbeat. kind of what happened yesterday. I told my room mate about my granddad and she gave me a hug and I wanted to just cry, but I hate to do that in front of people. Lord have mercy it is HOT. I am about to catch on flames I am soooooo hot. well I have typed for twenty minutes so I am leaving now. I sure am glad cause it is really hard to just wait until your mind has something to say. I mean when you aren't thinking about it you can think all day long but when you are trying to think of something to say you cant do it. never fails. happens to me every time. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well this is it , I guess?  My first writing assignment in Psychology. I sure hope that no one calls and interrupts my internet access. Watch!  Now that I've said that, someone will probably call. I'm the type of person that thinks that way. I mean, that if I say that I don't want something to happen, then I think that it probably will. The thing is, that those negative things that I think will happen seldom do. I guess I am just a cynical person like that. Wait, is that cynical or pessimistic?  I don't know!  Maybe I just think that way because I think it's humorous, or maybe I'm just trying to keep myself in check. Whatever it is, I just think that way sometimes. Enough about that. There sure are a lot  of fine women here at UT. Well. Maybe it's because I went to an all boy school for four years that I think that way. No, that's not it. These girls would look good regardless of where I went to high school. The good thing is that there are a lot of girls, the bad thing is that I havent met one yet. I have always been shy around girls and going to an all-boy high school didn't help anything. Well, I will say it right here!  I am going to do my best to get over that. With all these girls, I just can't let them pass me by. I see how happy my roommate and friend is with his girlfriend. I also hear countless stories of all these ""fine"" girls that he has met. I want to be the one with the stories and the girl. Not that I want  my friend to not have the stories and the girl, but I want those things, too. Heartbreaking story:  there is this real ""fly"" Asian girl in my Chemistry class. On the first day, she sat right next to me!  Then I don't see here for a couple of days. Today I see her, finally!  And she's holding some dude's hand!  Oh well, I guess?!? There's an addiction that I must get over. Not drugs, or alcohol, or anything bad like that. You see, I love to play at the local arcade. I must spend about two dollars every other day in there. My money isn't limitless and everytime I put a quarter into the arcade machine, then that's one less load of laundry that I can do. Now do I want 20 minutes of entertainment or clean clothes. I don't know. It seems that every free moment I have I am in that stupid arcade. A tie-in with the last paragraph: maybe I don't meet any girls because I am in the arcade all the time. Prediction:  I get out of the arcade, I take on an outgoing attitude, and I will meet a girl. Before I finish with this writing assignment, let me tell you about the two addictions that I have that I don't really care to get rid of. I love the Simpsons, and hip-hop. There's something about both of those that I just find pure joy in. In both cases, I see, here, and enjoy things that most people don't. It seems that the more obscure or ""hidden"" the things that I find enjoyment, the more joy I find in it. I guess it's that I am such a fan of both that the ordinary just isn't quite good enough. That's sort of bad. I should just enjoy the Simpsons and hip-hop for what they are and stop looking for the obscure. Well, this wasnt so bad. With this  being the first assignment, I guess I'll see you( the psychology web-page) tomorrow . "
Tell me about yourself.,"I have a feeling this is going to be a long 20 minutes. I don't even know where to start, and I don't think I really care. oh well. USC plays Florida St. tonight. I hope USC crushes them. I wish I was in California right now. Sunny skies and 70 degrees. My roommate is an idiot. I don't think he thinks before he speaks. He is the clumsiest person I have ever met. what else should I say?  I still feel sick from last night. Too much Beast!!  I've got to get replenished for tonight. Lots of good football and beer. Hopefully some bitches will be here. I smell food in the kitchen. I'm hungry as fuck. All Ive eaten this morning is Fruity Pebbles. I love Fruity Pebbles. I need more milk from the store. The Cowboys play tomorrow night at 7:00. Dallas is the greatest city in the world. Nobody does it better!!  I can't wait to get home in a month or so. I need to go to the bathroom, but I guess I can hold it in for another 10 minutes. This is a waste of time. I wonder what you people can find out from this stuff. Random thoughts are weird. My eyes hurt. I need to go to the bathroom. It sounds like Tennessee is beating UCLA. I hate UCLA. USC is the shit!!  I need to call my old roommate from USC. I need to eat. This is boring. I wonder how much time I have left. It looks like 10 minutes more. My roommate is obnoxious. He never stops talking and usually says nothing of importance. I think he has some serious problems. Maybe not. The girl next door is hot. I hope she comes over tonight to watch the UT game. She's got a great body. I'm still hungry. I need to get a job. My funds are running a little low. I waste too much money. I hope I win the lottery tonight. I hate this assignment. I guess it's pretty easy though. I better get an A in this class. I hate BA101. It is a pointless class. I need to do my assignment in there. I miss my homies in Dallas. I love kickin' it with them. You can't beat good friends and good beer. I wonder why I like to drink. It makes me feel good at the time, but I feel like shit every morning. I don't even remember when I started to drink in high school. Malt liquor is nasty, but when you're on a budget it hits the spot. Magnum. When I turn 21 I'm going to go nutty. Las Vegas here I come. only 3 more months. I better not fuck up when I turn 21. I need to keep getting good grades. Only 2 more years of this crap. I can't say that I've learned anything significant in college. All it's taught me is that you have to have one to get a job, but from there it is all on your shoulders. I like my summer job. Real world experience is better than book learning. I'm pretty sure they will hire me on after I graduate. I love computers. I guess that's why I'm an MIS major. They have so much power it is unbelievable. I need to eat. When I'm done maybe Ill order a pizza. My roommate is so loud. I'm gonna yell at his lazy ass. All he does while I'm at school is sleep and watch TV. Rough life. I need to take out the trash. I need to get some beer for tonight. Maybe something ritzy. I need to get a job. I wish all assignments were this easy. Too many classes and not enough time. I need to find a girlfriend. The girl next door has potential. It's Party Time by Tracey Lee is on the radio. It's the jam. I love rap music. The beats are great and that's why I love it. He is the clumsiest person in the world. If my window is broken I will kick his ass. What a fool. It's Party time, whoa yeah it's party time, we havin a party. Time's up. "
Tell me about yourself.,"it seems to me that the purpose of this assignment is not really to examine our mundane thoughts that we perceive but the logic behind the way our mind thinks. Since most my time is spent analyzing my thoughts and their processes I think that I must examine more of the logical progression.       This entry to me simulates making an entry into my journal. I look at that and realize that everything in their is exactly what you want. The most interesting things that I think about and that lead into other realms our my interactions with other people. Today at dinner I saw my ex-girlfriend from high school. she wasn't just a high school crush but the relationship lasted for over a year. After our break up things went down hill to the point that we don't ever talk to each other any more. She sat down with my roommate because she was with a mutual friend of ours. it is odd the way that the alliances from my old group of friends turned out. my roommate and I  can see because we have been friends for a long time and we never ran into the point where there was never any conflict between us. One of my other friends who I used to love more than any other person in the world is still a good friend but not quite ion the same level as we were once on(over my girlfriend we separated because he had just broken up weigh her a month earlier.     That brings up a question that everyone tries to answer:  Is friendship or a relationship more important?  all three of us were best friends but I bet with my ex that we could go to a higher level and stay there. The question that developed inside was it really a different level or another aspect of the same. I almost lost a lot of my friends for her, but those friends are the only ones still around.     I wonder if this philosophy or psych?  Does it really matter. The problem I think with a lot sciences now days is that the focus is so small that their lack of background in other subjects prevents us as moving as far as we might. How can a man consider himself able to study minds without the back ground of the philosopher. He must have explored his own thought and beliefs enough if is to ever have the hope of trying to understand others. Schools inside psych seen contradictory. How can one just study the physiological aspect without considering the developmental. Psych in its self probably should not be a major but the aspiration of the one who would devote himself to biology, philosophy, and sociology. The thing that irks about most of psych is that they seem to indoctrinate their own school of thought onto the tablet of their students mind. I believe in an approach that provides the conflicting theories in order to allow the student to make up his own mind.   The problems with a lot of classes and student is that they do not teach the children the ability to come up with conclusions for themselves. How is the man who can purely memorize the data of other smart. he is a machine that must have data read in to perform a certain task. Those that can create an idea or image to provide those others is the one who deserves praise. He is the man who provides others with everything they receive in life. Even in the arts we have gotten to the point where it is simply regurgitating knowledge instead of creating it. Those students who take band tell me they have a hard improvising because they were just taught to read the music.     The door to true knowledge is creativity and self-examination. "
Tell me about yourself.,"In the eighteen years of my life I've realized that man is either born without a conscience or with one. I was born with one. In my heart I bleed at the injustices of the world, of the rights taken from humans because they had not the power. What is more distressing comes not from the fact that the injustice is so evident but because of the powerlessness of the victim. I believe that education can free a man. An educated society becomes more aware. It can offer self-esteem, knowledge, influence, and the voice to speak out. It has become my belief that I or anyone else who is willing can make a difference. The conscience in me longs to make a difference. To scream at the top of my lungs, ""This is wrong! You are wrong! Give back his rights! Give back what does not belong to you!"" but I know in the bottom of my heart that humans, no matter how hard they may try will never rid the earth of its total harshness, because some men were born with feeling and some without. This gives no excuse for not trying to make a change for the better because with every change, an initiation must begin. Though my eyes see the sorrow of the world, I am a person who strives to look for the positive in people. My first encounter with an individual has me searching and finding his good qualities. More likely I am opt to say something good about a person rather than bad. Within me I feel no intimidation toward others strengths and I take pleasure in finding and praising someone else's gifts. Determination is the driving force of my soul. Being perceptive of other's nature has allowed me to see that it takes more than intelligence to reach a goal. I know only if I want it can be done and within my veins is a spirit that keeps me aiming to reach the top. It seems forever that I have expected highly of myself. With every aspect of my life I feel a certain pull to be the best I can be. Rarely do I accept being less. My love of knowledge and natural curiosity arrives from my need to grasp my world to better understand it. I cannot accept just reading new knowledge. It is utterly important for me to comprehend it as well. This allows me to know the unknown, to conquer all the earth's secrets for I do not like being put in the dark. I must see all things with my eyes, my heart, and my brain. This gives me confidence and strength. Hopefully, I will conquer all my fears, build my character, and use it to make a difference in the world. "
Tell me about yourself.,"stream of consciousness - well, The first thing that comes to mind is why exactly do I have to do this? I know college is going to be more difficult than high school, but projects like this don't have any meaning to me, honestly. I am wondering what will become of me after my collegiate studies. I want to become a doctor but then again I want to be a musician too. I mean I have been playing the piano, singing, acting, speaking, directing bands, and performing for almost all of my life. I want to continue but a part of me is saying - You need to become a doctor because you love biology, anatomy, and physiology; you can be financially secure if you become a doctor! I want to tell myself don't worry about it and what happens will happen. I don't know what to write about anymore! I'm laughing at myself because whatever I am typing I am literally reading it out loud to myself as I write it. I'm thinking is that normal? Anyway, I'm now listening at the keys of the keyboard and the sound that they make, and I am amazed as just how fast I type without formal or informal training. I then think about how blessed I am to be here in college with the opportunity to follow my dreams, once I figure out which dream is possible or realistic. How do I know that my major is the right one? I mean, I am now a microbiology/pre-med ,major and I don't know if that's my fate. Should I be in the college of fine arts and the school of music attempting to become a vocalist which is my other dream for myself. I am looking at how long I have been typing. Only 13 minutes. The phone just rang and I had to answer it; I hate that happened because I was interested to find out what this paper would end up like if I would write continuously. What am I talking about? Well, anyway, I enjoy music and stage. I like volleyball and am very upset that there aren't any male teams in high school or college that are competitive with other schools. My contacts are bothering me; somehow I have the ability to blink awkwardly and move my contact around so that they feel somewhat more comfortable. well, I was just disturbed for about 15 minutes because one of my friends came over to ask how to install his Ethernet card. But guess what I am almost done . I just have a few more minutes. I don't what to write about. I hope that this class is going to be very beneficial. I hope to learn alot because psychology, esp. the physiological aspects really interest me. I'm wondering whether or not I will get an ""A"" this semester for PSY 301. Well, I'm done! "
Tell me about yourself.,"Okay. I'm in the stupid SMURF lab. there are so many people here. I saw Brian downstairs. Sometimes he worries me. He met a new guy the other day and already had sex with this guy. I don't know if he used protection or not. but it worries me. He's so. so. spontaneous about things. I don't ever really know if he thinks things through. He just does as he pleases which isn't a bad thing. but it can be dangerous. I wish he'd just look at himself and what he's doing and decide if it's the right or wrong thing to do. He doesn't need to be going around having sex with whomever whenever. He knows and I know that he's a whore. It's not a surprise to anyone. But, he doesn't care. so it seems. Of course, I call him a whore jokingly but in a way I'm serious about it. He knows what can happen to him and it sucks that he doesn't care. Man. Men!!! Men suck! Josh needs to realize that I will never be with him again. He thinks things will change. he's so wrong. For two years I had to put up with his shit and all his lies. There is no way in hell I'd ever even give a second thought to going back out with him. He knows he's an asshole and I let him know that a long time ago. How dare he even bring up the idea of us getting back together. He's a 12 year old trapped in a 24 year old's body. He has no idea what a good relationship is and he doesn't know the meaning of trust. He needs to grow up and realize that he can't always get what he wants. and when he can't get it he needs to just give up and move on with his pointless life. I've moved on and he needs to realize that. I'm not there to be at his beck and call and I'm not there to just be there when no one else is. He lost whatever respect I had for him a long long long time ago. Why is it that I always seem to get stuck in the worst situations when it comes to relationships? Hell. let's see my record thusfar: hmmm, Josh is the asshole, Jay was just a jerk, Seth is the only man I ever loved and he's in California, Craig was someone that I could consider a ""summer love"". but he's at another college. Well, screw it!!  I need to concentrate on getting all A's and B's this year so I can get that free plane ticket to anywhere in the US. Plus, I get $50/A!!  I need the money. I'm poor now and I have bills to pay!  Damnit all to hell. bills!!!  Responsibility!!  Yeah, I have responsibilities as an adult but I don't think the 'rents realize that. I'm 19 years old. 20 in April. yet I'm still a little girl who can't do anything right for shit according to them. What the hell do they know?  I'm not living with them now and they don't see how hard I work to get where I am and how hard I try to be social, to get the education I need, and to get a job worth having in this freakin' town!!  It's hard to find a job. but I've done it. And what do they say when I tell them this?  ""that's nice"". What is that? Why don't they just tell me how they really feel. ""Oh, well, that's still not the real world so it doesn't count""  I swear they piss me off. My mom is the worst. She wants to lecture me about dishonesty and all that shit. Well, HELLO! Guess who's fixin' to eat her words!! I caught her smoking this past weekend. Yep. right there by the side of the house puffin' away like a chimney. What was that you said mom?  You quit smoking?  Right. and I was so proud of you!  All that's blown to hell now. So, I caught her. and what did Miss ""Liane, I can't trust you"" do?  Well, she decides to kiss my ass to try and make up for her lie. Yes sir! She bribed me with four 60-minute phone cards and $50. OH and she even told me that I could just pay for my speeding ticket without having to take the class. . Yes, that means it would go on my record but ""oh, that's okay. it's not much more on your insurance. Besides, we just got a load of money back from the insurance company because of our good  driving records"". Oh yeah. she was brown-nosing BIG TIME. I have lost a lot of respect for her for doing that. I don't know whether I should just forget about it and let her do what she will or tell my dad and have him deal with it. I swear. this world is nothing but a big mass of contradictions! I'm not saying that I'm perfect. but I've learned over the past few years about what I want out of life and what I don't want. I'm living my life the way I want to. as stress-free as possible and as happy as possible. When I'm put into these stupid situations it just makes life that much harder and it sucks!  I'm so tired of looking at this computer screen. I think it's about time for me to stop thinking. Yep. it is about that time. Thank God. Now I have to go help Brian with his Spanish work that he swore was gonna be ""SOOOO EASY"". I knew he'd have trouble. and I knew he would turn to me. I'm no bilingual. but what the hell. I do what I can to help my friends out. I've been called ""too nice""? How the  hell can someone bee ""too nice""????????? "
Tell me about yourself.,"O. K. Here I am in the computer lab in my dorm. I really do not know what to say because I have never had an assignment like this before. Anyway, college life is very different from my high school life. I do no t drink therefore being with a complete different crowd of people, I find myself being very uncomfortable. I suppose once I get settled and used to my new surroundings that everything will be fine. Don't get me wrong, I love UT. I could not wait to get here, it is just the whole different atmosphere. I have met a lot of interesting people so far and I am sure there are many left to find and meet. My classes are so much more time consuming than I ever expected. I joined a sorority this year and now I never seem to have any time to myself. Then there is the whole boyfriend situation. My boyfriend goes to A&M. Real convenient right. I miss him so much when I am here. He is the best person I have ever met in my entire life. His generosity, compassion, sensitivity, and love amaze me. I am so happy when I am with him. He is coming tomorrow to see me. Needless to say I am counting down the hours and minutes until he arrives. I have so much planned for us to do. I am fine being with out him. Long distance relationships are harder than you think they would be. We are making it work however. I have never trusted anyone as much I do him. I think it is the same with him. I am not nervous about him being in a different town or setting - I know he would never do anything to hurt. It is just the whole being apart thing. it has only been two weeks since we have seen each other. Sounds like a short time to everyone else but they just do not understand. that is another thing. I do not think many people understand me. My boyfriend, Jay does- very well- it is almost scary well he knows and understands me. it also provides comfort though. I cannot believe this whole paper has turned into a description of my life with my boyfriend. Anyway, he is coming tomorrow like I said and I cannot wait. Next weekend I am going home to Lufkin. Jay is going with me. I was on drill team and will be returning to the homecoming game. It will be a nice break from the hectic college world. I miss my bed. there is something about YOUR bed. the ones here are not the same. I miss my dog too. She is so sweet and loving. She used to sleep with me and now there is not a lump in the foot of my bed. Well I believe my time is up. this was fun. I have never sat down and written out my thoughts and feelings - I think it helps!       "
Tell me about yourself.,"this is by far one of the most interesting assignments I have ever had to do  not the first stream of consciousness assignment, rather the first time I have ever submitted anything to an instructor via the web. this technology is absolutely amazing and exciting because it is potentially so very dangerous. it is as if no one is safe anymore. I am very hungry right now and I could really use a lunch break, but there never seems to be any time to afford that type of luxury. I am writing this in the student microcomputer facility and there are a whole lot of computers in this place, I guess they need this many to accommodate 40. 000 plus students, this sure is a big school but there are a lot of advantages that come with that. I am beginning to wonder if this class is simply a tool for all of the psychological researchers at this school. it is obvious that one of the reasons UT has one of the best research departments in the country is that they take advantage of a class that at one point or another every student at this place has to take. this provides for an enormous field from which to gather information. in its own way it is rather sneaky. however, it is not necessarily a bad thing. I am actually thinking of being a psy major. I think I may double major with a BA in music and another liberal arts degree . I sure am glad I switched out of my performance major. I just didnt want to compromise my love of music for the narrow path I was treading. there was simply no t enough room for my own creativity to get involved. my stomach is becoming impatient with me. 20 minutes is a lot longer than it seems. it would be interesting to read different responses to this assignment because I bet that a lot of people think about a lot of different things. . in a class of five hundred it would be hard to have one general make-up. this keyboard is very stiff and rather annoying to type on . oh well. I wonder how much money is spent on computers at this school every year. I dont want to think about it. it is strange being a sophomore in a class with so many freshmen. at least I know what to expect. I am gradually running out of things to write. this type of writing forces you to think about what you are thinking about which is a very strange concept. I think the radio show went well last night  I hope to get all of the technical kinks worked out by nest week so that we dont look so incompetent. I don't think I spelled that right. just goes to show that most of your primary education is soon forgotten. probably why they dont hire people right out of fourth grade. my roommates hair is orange and pink right now and he wants to bleach those colors out and make it purple. I told him that no one would take him seriously that he needed to be serious about his non-conformity. that word is soooo overused and really annoying. sort of like the e-coli scare or playing the race card. we live in a society of sheep who blindly follow whatever is hip and chic without ever questioning what they are doing. this stream of consciousness is about to come to an end due to the fact that my 20 minutes are just about up if any one had to actually read this, I apologize for the sloppy spelling, bad grammar and weak syntax. I guess that's what being a TA is all about, huh? "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am very frustrated with this computer. I am the most computer illiterate person, and for this day and age, that is no good. I want to check my e-mail but it is telling me my password is incorrect. I am famished right now. I have had this job on my mind all day. I really want to teach dancing but she wants me to teach tap along with ballet, jazz, and cheerleading. I am not the most qualified person to teach tap and I feel I would be doing my students a great injustice be teaching that class. Also she has me working on Saturdays and if I ever want to go home I will have to find a substitute teacher. This is going to take up a lot of my time and as a freshman I need to make the grades. Especially around finals I will need time to study and that is when the studio is going to have a winter show. That means I would have to choreograph six dances and find music. But the thing is I really want to teach dancing like I did back home. This is such a hard decision because I already accepted the job and I feel bad backing out on Sherri, the owner. I guess after writing all of this out there are more cons than pros. My friend Chad is sitting next to me and he keeps asking me how to spell words. He is interrupting my train of thought. I love typing on computers I just don't know too much about them. I really want to check my e-mail. My dad me something and I would like to read it. I think I'm hungry for Chinese food tonight. But chips and hotsauce sound so good. Really I think I want Italian. I can always eat Italian food. I guess it is since I am almost 100% Italian. The food a Jester is really bad. I have been living off tuna and speghettios that I keep in my room. You know I think I'm going to quit my job that I just got two days ago. I really need to call her right now but I'm at the Flawn, so I will do it when I get home. My arm is kind of  hurting from typing. Maybe I have carpal tunnel syndrome. Just kidding. I was looking for the submit button but I'm not sure which one it is. I'll have to ask Chad. He is my boyfriend and my best friend. I wasn't sure if I would want a boyfriend my first year of college, but right now I am glad I have him. I think a lot of it is we are more like friends most of the time. Or really a lot like brother and sister. But I love him. Well I have a lot of other homework and studying I can be doing so this is the end of my thoughts. Well those will never end but this is the end of me recording them. Bye!     "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm sitting here at my boyfriend's place, and I am hungry. That's about the biggest thing on my mind right now. When I have to write my thoughts down, I just can't seem to know what I feel at that specific moment. Well, I guess,  right now I can say I'm thinking more about what I am actually going to type rather than what I am feeling or what kind of emotions I possess. OK, so now my boyfriend is trying to give me ideas on what to write. I, of course, told him that I will write only what is on my mind right now (which is HUNGER). Princess Diana's death just popped into my head. I can't believe she is dead,  even though I never paid attention to her. She was just one of those people  who I thought would always be in the news until she was ancient. Just a shock. The Hansons are stupid. I just now saw an MTV commercial with them on it. As you can guess, I am not a big fan. I thought they were kind of cute at first,  but the more I heard their song, the more I disliked them. Celine Dion needs to come up with some songs of her own. She is always remaking the old ones. All I can say is that she can't sing them as good as the people who first did. I never get E-mail. I know it's my only my first week of school, but I like  to get mail. Plus, E-mail is new to me. I've never had an E-mail address before. I was really uncomfortable today when my boyfriend's roommate, girlfriend, and  her friends came over. I can never seem to get comfortable around his friends. It's like they scrutinize me. I definitely do not like to be in the spotlight. Well, only if it's for a good thing. Like for an achievement or if I know for sure that I will not be embarrassed. Otherwise, I'd rather just be apart  of the crowd or stand in the back. Being uncomfortable is the worst feeling. Oh, goodness!  It has been twenty minutes already. Time flew by. I kind of  liked doing this. It was kind of a relief to just sit and type and not worry about sticking to a certain topic or subject. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Today is the Friday before labor Day. My boyfriend is picking me up and we are going to drive back to Houston. I am excited about going home. My suite mate is also going home this weekend. That is fun. Her parents don't want her to come back so soon. In one way I don't really want to go home either. I am going because I will get to spend time with my boyfriend. His name is Jonathan-by the way. My room mate is sleeping. I kinda feel bad about typing while she is sleeping, but I have things I need to get done. One of those things involves typing. She has been really mood lately as far as people being quite. She needs to understand that living with three people is hard. I have Flower from Bambi on my desk. I got her from my boyfriend. I collected all of the McDonald's toys. I had all the characters from Bambi except Flower. I don't remember why I mentioned that to him, but he went to an Antique store and found Flower!  It was really sweet. He gave it to me when I was sick. We have a really good relationship. It is really hard being away from him. We have only been dating for three months, but we have spent every hour of every day of those three months together. There was only one day we spent apart. He went to his dad's house. He went there early in the morning. I was really tired that day. I don't remember what I did but I was tired after. It was a long day with out him. I think my friends started to feel neglected because I was spending so much time with Jonathan. Most of them understood. I did make time for them-but just not as much time as  I was spending with them before Jonathan and I were together. My friend Jessica and I got into a big fight because I was spending so much time with Jonathan. That was part of the problem. The other part of it was that she stopped taking her Prozac. Bad move. She really upset me. We going in a fight at 3rd period and I was crying at 4th. I went to talk to a friend of both mine and Jessica's about the situation. Jessica showed up and started yelling at me even more. I was none too happy. Lauren told me that Jess was under alot of stress because of family problems and other things. I didn't understand why she couldn't be happy for me. Jonathan was my first real boyfriend. Jess has gone through many. I am always happy and supportive of them and her relationships. For once I wish she could do the same for me. It has all worked out now and Jessica and I have talked. We are friends again. That is good. I hate it when people are mad at me. I do not do well with enemies. My mommy always taught me to never make enemies. I still call my mom mommy. I don't know why. It is just one of those things. One of Shoshana's friends would tease me about that. That's OK. I'm well over that!  I have my next class at 2-3. I don't know what I will do until then. I think I might do some of my work-but that is not likely. I think I will return some e-mail and stare at the walls. I'm good at that!  It's my hobby, next to sleeping!  Until next time I have to type-I think I will go now!   "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am so down in the dumps right now because I have just broken off  a two year relationship. I seriously  hope I didn't just throw away the best relationship I ever had or will have. I can't help but feel slightly unattractive right now because Mark has already started to get over me quite well and Reid and Eric don't treat me the way they used to. I dont understand why people can't simply be honest about the way they feel. I probably have spent half of my life wondering what everyone else was thinking. I t is such a waste of time. If I saw a girl and she seemed really nice, I don't see why I couldnt just go up to her and be like, ""hi""  And  guys won't ever meet a girl with the intention of gaining a friend. The whole process is so much more exasperating than it seems worth at times. The friends I have now are my good friends. I just instantly clicked with them. There wasn't any of this trying not to seem overly eager to hang out with you bullshit that usually goes along with the turf of making new  friends. That's sort of why I resent Plano I guess. The stupid system and expectations they have totally just messed me up in the head. I don't have nay self-confidence. It is hard to feel like you are somebody in a class of 1500. I wasn't good at any sports, or at least not good enough to play there. so why did I come to a school with 50000 people full of clicks just like it was in high school?  I will probably be perpetually putting on the front of self-confidence and self-assuredness. thats what sucks about the world. Everybody just bullshits everyone else. People are so insincere and self-serving. I know I am. there are so many rules that govern the group that you belong to. You can't wear what you want or anything. I am not saying that I don't like the way that I look but every now and then it would be cool to go out in what I want to wear  or whatever and I could know that people weren't  talking about  it behind my back. Looking at my thoughts on screen makes me so ashamed of them. I'm nit a bad person. I just kive up to every part of the whole Greek system that ever gave it a bad name. rush is such a load of crap. everyone acts like they know or care who you are. it all turns out to be the same people in the same crowds that they ran around with in high school. I wish the rest of the work wasn't like this too. But I guess is doesnt matter where you go because it will always be the same old bullshit. pretty girls date the cutest boys who have the good luck to bring home the big bucks to raise their kids in an upper middle class lifestyle. so it goes. Kurt vonnegut really knew what was up. That's why I like him because he doesn't preach all this ""the sun will come up tomorrow crap""  he knows that if the sun comes up tomorrow you will probably get a really bad sunburn and die of skin cancer in the end. I hope mark doesnt meet any girls at this party I just don't want it to be too late to have him back once I get this whole lifestyle change thing out of my system. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I really don't like doing homework. How many hours of my life have been                                                                                                   spent doing homework? I'm sure the  number is unreal. Of course the only time I actually think about mundane things like how many hours I've spent doing homework  is when I'm doing something really boring like. well  homework. Its really warm in my room. I guess I'll have to go down and  get another maintenance request form. There's something seriously wrong with  our air-conditioning which is just not a good thing in Austin, Texas  in the summer. The last time the maintenance man came, he turned the vents down toward the floor. This was his ingenious plan. Great. Needless to  say, that didn't work. So back down to the dorm office I go. Joy of my life. I really wish I was in the mountains. We missed our hiking trip  this summer because we were to busy  showing horses. We went to Canadian  Nationals, but surprise, the horse show was located in the only existing  ugly portion of Canada. Oh well, I'll have to focus on our Christmas  skiing trip and think of the cold snow as I sit in my sweltering room. Well twenty minutes is up. I'm gone.  "
Tell me about yourself.,"Im sitting here drinking a beer. what is that picture on my desk-I stole this calculator from a party and I dont know why-I feel so bored- I've been doing homework all day and it's labor day-what a waste there are tons of people by the pool and I want to go there-its scary though what am I going to eat for dinner-I think that Im getting fat-I drink too much and am not exercising enough my girlfriend doesnt want me to order playboy-whats up with that- she also wont let me smoke my life is controlled-I dont think that I want to be an engineer anymore-they make lots of money but it might be boring I worked all summer and then had to spend all my money paying my lawyer- I hate lawyers they're scum-I hate fratboys too-although I wish I was in a frat I dont know anyone at this school-I want to transfer to atm because I know lotsa of people there I have a scholarship here though that I cant just leave. my shoulder is hurting-its from leaning over this keyboard-this has got to be the easiest writing assignment of my life I normally hate writing assignments-I definitely am not going to do that research paper why does this page have no ending width-these sentences are getting really long when am I going to finish my other hw? I missed the first two days of one of my classes and now I dont even know what the hw assign are. the gate outside my window keeps opening and makes this squeaking noise my roommate is worthless-hes supposed to get our dishwashing rack and get the exterminator to come but he's too lazy and all that he does is sit around and play his computer game I just looked at the clock and its only been 10 minutes-20 minutes is a long time when you are thinking about it-I remember when I played soccer 40 minutes seemed like 4 hours especially when you were losing I wonder what my family is doing right now-I miss my brother-hes going to come to school here next year-I cant decide if we should live together or what-it would be a lot of fun I dont know if I could handle another year in the dorms-they suck especially the bathrooms and the food-actually everything about them is bad- I wonder if anyone is going to be able to read my typing I dont type like Im supposed to. I only use about half of my fingers and I dont use any particular order most of my words look misspelled because I hit the wrong key first aha-15 minutes-only five more to go I wonder if everyone counts down the minutes in their papers-I bet that about 90 percent of the students write a line about how much time has passes ,etc my neck is really starting to hurt now-I worked on the computer all summer-8 hours a day but my neck still isnt used to it I wonder how many words I've typed so far my brain seems to be at a standstill-should I get drunk tonight? do labs start tomorrow I hope not I love punching the enter key   it feels like I've accomplished something every time it gets punched my friends ought to be here pretty soon of course theyll want to get drunk its so quiet in here-Im glad I have a computer and didnt have to go all the way to the ugl have I almost filled up the entire page-it looks like Im almost at the bottom I am almost there-I guess thats why you made the width unending time up    "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm pissed. I just sat here for twenty fuckin' minutes thinking I'm all bad ass and shit, trying to do this assignment and all along I was doing it wrong. Oh well, I really shouldnt be cussing. I find this rather relaxing in a way. I'm feeling lazy the last couple of days have been very draggy. So right now I'm thinking that I'm a fat, short girl with a high self esteem is that possible? Anyway right now I'm feeling let me think of what I am feeling. I'm feeling exited because I get to go home this weekend. I get to see my boyfriend and family. I was just noticing that I worded that differently. Wrong it's family and boyfriend. I havent been home in a while, so it will be great to eat some home cooked food. So do you get some freaked out nutcases in these assignment? I meant to put an 's' but I was too lazy to go back. Yesterday I killed my roommate and her soul will be back to haunt me as I sleep. She was a weird little bitch anyway. I got the kitchen knife and stuck it in her head. I didn't like her head anyway. It was weirdish. And of coarse I'm just joking. I am a pathological, no compulsive liar. Right now I hate my stomach it sucks because it is so damn huge. You see Im pregnant and it gets in the way sometimes, all the time. That is why I have not been home in such a long time. My dad would strangle me. Yeah so my boyfriend and I had a fling  one night, an unprotected fling and this is how I got in trouble. He then left me because he couldnt handle the publicity, it would be bead for him. seeing as how he's a politician and all his wife would freak, so I got myself a new boyfriend and now he believes that the baby is his. Men are so dumb!!!!!!!! My roommate is always forgetting shit, it's fuckin' annoying the hell out of me I mean you can't carry a fuckin' convo. with the girl I wish   could kick her ass right here in front of all these ugly people. They can't stop me I'm mega bitch. She wants to go into mass comm. This is my message to her ""GOOD fuckin' luck!!!!!!!!"" oh well, Im calm now. well, I was going to go on but it has been twenty minutes . Yes   type very very slow. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Here I go. I keep thinking whether or not I am doing this right. I can't seem to spell anything right. I am going to correct all my spelling after I am done. This line just keeps on going. There was just a commercial with people that that said ""I am in the woods"" and it sounded like the other add that says ""I am Tiger Woods"". I am so glad the Cowboys won today. I am not even looking at the screen now, because I was losing my concentration. Only 5 minutes have gone by. I wonder when my roommate will get back. I still dont know why my phone won't work. This line just keeps on going. It is a little bit hot in here. I am getting tired. I sure am glad I got this chair. I wonder how Jason is doing. I wonder bow many of my friends are in Rockwall now. I had a dream about Kim again last night. I wonder when I will see her next. I sure wish I could type better. Now it has been 10 minutes. When is Audra going to call. It is 10:30. Time sure does go by faster here. I need to think about all the  things I need to do tomorrow. But I dont want to. It has almost been 15 minutes. I am anxious to mail my letters. I wonder if I have any mail. I just found food on my shirt. I wish I had something better to eat. I wonder  Oh there showing the tennis highlights now. I am glad that Agassi is doing better. I am noticing that I am writing ""I wonder"" a lot. It is starting to get harder to type now because I am getting tired. I think the twenty minutes are up. I am stopping now. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I hate it when you get so confused and you don't know what to think about anything. Sometimes you think you are making the right decision but then you start to doubt yourself. I guess I tend to do that a lot lately. I never know if what I am doing is right or not. Will it work in the long run? Oh well. School gets to be confusing but I guess that is at least something  that is relatively constant. I don't think I deal that well with change. But I am not so sure anyone really does. Things tend to be uncertain a lot more that a lot of people like to  admit. The only thing that I know for sure is that no one person stays the same no matter how much they would like  things to. Personally, I have always thought that it is possible to care or even love more than one person at the same time. I am not sure why or when monogamous  relationships came around but I am not exactly sure they work. I actually have a lot of proof, just look at the divorce rate. But I guess that is not really proof of anything except for the fact that people have given up forgiving other people for their mistakes. Everything changes schools, and people and everything else. When you see people that you have known a long time in a different setting, why does everything seem so weird. Some of them seem nicer others have changed so much that you can't even recognize who they are. Anyway, I am really tired of thinking about this. Computers can really get so annoying. I realize that they are supposed to be a good thing but they can be really confusing too. I guess everything really is. I am getting really tired of talking to myself or at least that is how I feel I wonder what draws certain people to certain things. Like what makes me like  the color pink and someone else absolutely detest it?  My next question is  why do I put things off?  I guess because I don't like to admit to myself that I actually have work to do. Plus I guess I am just plain lazy. There's nothing like having a few really close friends but then that can be a bad thing too. But another problem is when you have a group of friends, and of course if there are guys and girls in the group as there normally one of them becomes attracted to another and of course that can become a huge problem. The worst thing is that if something does happen between those people then it will eventually seriously affect the  rest of the group. La La La!!! I feel so retarded right now and my time is up. So I guess this is goodbye. At least until I do my next righting assignment. "
Tell me about yourself.,"My stream of consciousness is being disrupted by several things at this time. My computer has been giving me nothing but continual stress and troubles. First, my computer is a piece of crap. I called a guy to come hook everything up to it and he basically laughed and was unable to figure it out. Then the guy told me to take it to the campus computer store. I carried the entire, heavy hard drive to the store in the heat. While there, everyone I talked to laughed at me. I ate dinner alone, as I usually do since I have not made very many new friends. I have had no sleep because of how many classes I've had to take this semester because of credit hours and retouching courses. I am so stressed out. I just learned that my CDROM drive isn't working so I'm about to cry because now when I go home this weekend I have to convince my parents to fork over a bunch of money they don't have so my computer will be like everyone elses'. My roommates Dad went through and installed everything one can possibly think of so she laughs at my computer problems which makes me feel worse. I miss my home and my dogs and my boyfriend and my friends so much that now I'm crying. All the stress I'm feeling is making me depressed and hungry and tired all the time. Gale, my roommate keeps me up really late at night and then wakes up at 6:30 to put on ALOT of makeup. She is so loud that I want to scream, but instead I keep my mouth shut because it feels like when I open my mouth to say things that might hurt peoples feelings or make them mad I end up losing the close relationship I had with them. So I guess I'm sort of keeping everything inside so that I don't lose any few friends that I made. It seems like everyone makes better grades than me here. I am so scared because I have so many questions about UT but nobody seems to know how to answer them. I knew that moving up here would be a big change, but I thought I could handle it. I know that once I adjust I will grow very strong and independent from this experience, but I feel that I may not be ready. I don't wear makeup for some reason that I have never been able to figure out. I always feel like I need improvement in something. Like with this essay, even though I know the length of it does not matter, I still feel it must be long to be acceptable. When I walk around to my classes I see so many people that they all look the same to me. It is so hot outside when I walk. I'm so thirsty right now that I am going to send this paper so I can get a drink. Then I'm going to call my mother and beg for a computer like everyone else has so I can feel like I fit in more. I won't get it so now I've got to prepare to use Gale's computer all year. My boyfriend is driving up here on Friday to spend the day with me at UT. I wish I had my own apartment so I could get some sleep. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, here  I am writing continuously for twenty minutes. The weird thing is that this keyboard is laid out differently than the one I have back home so it makes typing really difficult. Not to mention the fact that yesterday I got a cut on my finger and hitting the I button tends to hurt a little bit. I am a little concerned about coming to the end of this line but apparently it will automatically wrap my words for me. I am going on a trip to the beach tomorrow. Well at least that's the plan. We don't have anywhere to stay not to mention any food. Oh well, it hopefully will be a lot of fun. I am sitting at Mac 9. I wish they had IBM's in here. That would make my life a little easier. The computer in my room crashed and I can do absolutely nothing on it right now. It's weird I have been writing for about five minutes and I am only on my third line. Well I guess that's what long lines will do to you. There were really long lines at the student computer center the other day. MY roommate was such an angel and stood in line for me when I went to class. A girl just walked in to the computer room with headphones on. I think that is a little weird. I guess she likes to listen to music and type at the same time. I guess you can do laser copies in here. I will have to remember that. I went out for coffee last night with my roommate and his girlfriend. It was a lot of fun and I got checked out by someone really cute. I wonder if this computer lady will help me figure out my e-mail in a little bit. Last time I asked she dismissed me very quickly. That shirt reminds me of McDonald's. The one a guy walked in here wearing. I really wonder what you are going to learn from me by reading this. Probably that I am very random, (all my friends tell me that) They also tell me I am a crack head. I'm not really, it's just an expression they use for me because I am so random and jump from subject to subject. Don't you think it's weird that we still write stop on stop signs. We could probably save a TON of paint if we didn't and besides who doesn't know that a red octagon means stop. That sounds like a really bad commercial. I have to go to class at 1:00. I feel weird telling people that I am going to Acting class. I feel very pretentious. I really think I am going to like the class though. I have been in theatre since fourth grade I just completely lost my train of thought. It got derailed you could say. I wonder what derailed it? Oh well, I guess that's what you are trying to figure out from me writing this. Life imitates art. I miss Ronnie Geva. Not really, but she is someone whom I am supposed to miss. I really miss Amanda. She is one of my best friends in the world. I called her the other night and when I heard her voice I could do nothing but cry. The computer lady walked by. Apparently she chooses whom she likes to help and who she doesn't. I never know when to use who and whom. I think I am going to save this really quick so that I won't accidentally lose it. Wait never mind that would lose my train of thought. I think it would at least. I really wish I could read some of the other students stream of consciousness papers. I want to see how similar they are to me. Maybe they aren't similar at all and I am the weirdo in the group. That's what my sister would like to have me believe. She pretends that she doesn't miss me but I know she does. I wonder how this whole e-mail thing is going to work. I can't wait to e-mail my dad and Amanda. I would e-mail my mom too but I don't know her school e-mail name. It's scary how many e-mail accounts my family has, I think the grand total is eight. Maybe nine. I don't know if my sister has one at school or not. It depends which class she is in. Nine accounts and four people. There are way to many ways to reach us. This is an odd power PC. This computer contains the fonts necessary for the software packages Plato and Socrates. I  wonder what those are. Probably some English programs or something. At least that's what the name implies. El tiburon means shark in Spanish. I think there is an accent but I am not so sure. Fireworks are really cool. My mom and I love to go sit under them and feel the booms. A couple of years ago there was a grass fire near where we were sitting. It was kind of exciting. Not something like rescue 911 but still it was interesting for us. I hope you find this interesting and not just some drivel about me. Drivel is such a fun word. It reminds me of dribble. Well, I have to jet. I hope I didn't write for too long but It is fun getting your thoughts out on paper. Like I am doing now, Auggghhhh the insanity. Or sanity, however you want to see it I guess. "
Tell me about yourself.,"It is 12:53 on Tuesday and my roommate and I just finished eating lunch and  came down to the computer lab to work on our assignment. My computer in our  room is not hooked up to the Internet yet, so for the time being I have to come  down here. That's ok. The guy just came over because we forgot to give him our  IDs. Oops. Oh well. Anyway, I'm really sad lately. I miss all my friends from high school. Everyone I've met so far has been really nice and everything; I just miss how close we all were last year. I could go anywhere, to any school function, and see people that I knew and would feel comfortable with. Here, it's not that there are so many people - it's just that there are so many  people that I don't know. Every face that I pass on campus is another stranger. Actually, I have seen a few people that I know from other places. Earlier today I saw Brittany. But it's just not the same as walking down the hall and knowing every single person. I was so comfortable there. I don't know. I should  probably be writing on the other assignment topic, since I'm going off about  high school and college and what have you, but I'm kind of just blabbering so  whatever. I am ready to be comfortable with lots of people again. I miss my comfort zone that I had at Anderson and I want it back!!   Hey!  I just looked at my watch and it has already been ten minutes. I guess I  can't really say that it's been ten minutes, because of that guy that came over. It's probably been more like seven minutes. I don't like this keyboard. It's kind of hard to type on. This assignment is actually harder than I thought it  would be. I mean, it's not hard, because I'm not really writing on anything in particular, but it is kind of hard to think continuously for twenty minutes. I think it's crazy that so many Anderson people are in my psychology class. It  also freaks me out that Alex is in our class. Since you don't know about Alex, just let me say that he is the most intimidating person in the world. I think  underneath that tough guy Russian thing he has going for him he's really  probably a very nice person, but I don't know how easy it is for me to look past  the fact that he actually chased someone with an axe on the last day of school our junior year at City Park. So I wouldn't fail Alex if I were you. He might come to your office with his axe (do you spell it ""axe"" or ""ax""?  I don't know) or his machete or any of his other assortment of weapons that he totes around with him. I would really like to get to know him though - I think he would be an interesting person to get under his skin and see what he's really like. Not to mention the fact that it would be cool to have him be your friend in case someone was giving you trouble. I think that time is probably almost up, but I would kind of like to keep  writing. I think I will. The temperature in this room is perfectly comfortable. I don't know where that thought came from. I am scared about having to write papers. What if my professors don't like the way I write?  I've always loved to write, but I like writing creatively. I'm pretty bad at comparing and  contrasting and all my research papers are boring. I mean I got good grades on  them, but later I'd go back and read them and be like ""Hey did I actually write this?  Yuck. ""  I think I'm probably being hard on myself. I wonder how many  times I have used the word probably in this assignment so far. I bet a lot. I hate when people don't know that a lot is two words and not one. I wonder what Angie's deal is. She used to be so nice, but ever since Dis and  I rushed she has been so rude. That's her problem, I know. And it kind of  always justifies the fact that I didn't like her that much. I always had to  act like I did, and she was nice enough, but just something about her has  always rubbed me the wrong way. That's what I told Brian. Brian -- what to do about Brian?  I wish I knew I wish I could have some answer. I hate  leading  him on the way I did the other night, but that just seemed unavoidable. I know he needs me  and that's what I love about him. When I'm around him I feel  special and needed and important. But I just don't know if that is enough. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I can't wait until tomorrow. I have only one class from 9 to 10 and then its time to go to the Matchbox 20 concert. I love Christie so much and I can't what to see her tomorrow. Christie, I hope you'll give me another chance some day. Your the best thing thats ever happened in my life. God I've changed so much this summer. I am so excited about pledgeship. I love you mom. I am going to study my rear off though to get a 4. 0. I wish I was living at Towers because Jester SUCKS. And the food is nothing special at all. I got to ask mom and dad for some cash. I really can't wait to get back to Houston to see everybody there and especially Dean, Cassie, Mrs. Smith, and of course Christie. I need to keep working out. It's doing me alot of good. Carter needs to tone it down in there so that I can finish this paper. Holy cow my mind just went blank. Oh wait a minute. 2 great looking girls are swimming over at the Theta house. I hope the Rockets win it all next year because the Bulls are really pissing me off. College is going to be tough but I think I will do just fine. I am going to be more than successful one day. I don't hope this, I know this. For the love of God. I type so slow it's not even funny. That's what I need to do is take a typing class because this is ridiculously to short and it should be much longer. Only one more minute of writing and then I'll. . . . . . Oh, what do you know. times up. "
Tell me about yourself.,"wanna see the real you- I love this song. by the suicide machines. I saw them last spring break with the descendents. good show. now green world is on. this is weird, trying to write continuously for 20 minutes. you tend to think  differently when you're forced to. like today, those questionnaires in psych class. I think I analyzed them too much and tricked myself into answering  differently. oh well. I have a lot of shit I need to be doing like returning that journalism book and buying the packet for that class. that class sucks. how  can journalists shove a camera and microphone in someones face when theyre in mourning or whatever. and those guys who caused the princess Di's wreck just for some pictures. it makes me sick. do they have no feelings or sympathy  whatsoever? does anyone? how the hell am I going to find a job that I like that doesnt require making it to the top, no matter who you step on to get there. I guess all jobs are like that Im just not a competitive person at all. never was. I dont need to put other people down or be the best at everything in order to feel good or proud like tough guys. sure Im proud of what I can do but I could  never hurt another soul doing it. well the musics off now and its quiet here in  my castilian dorm room except for the fan. my boyfriend and my friends are  upstairs, probably watching t. v. I wonder if he wants to go to that less than  Jake show tonight I want to. theyre pretty good. my back hurts. I need to go  to a chiropractor cant believe this stuff going through my head. how boring. I do think about interesting things sometimes. a few nights ago my boyfriend (kevin) and me and three other girls got into a huge (drunk) argument about  how the world would be different if women were in all power. then we starting  arguing, are gender differences biological or environmental? kevin thinks  theyre environmental, and has a nerdy, stubborn, math/scientist guy and shows  very little emotions. marita and I said no, its about 50/50, because women are  born with these instincts that men will never know until they grow uteruses  and give birth. ok I have 5 more minutes to write. my hair feels weird. I cut  about a foot off 2 days ago. it was down to my waist now its to my chin. I feel  bald. I wonder if I should dye it again. last year it was purple. man Im doing  it again, rambling on about boring stupid shit. I wonder if everyone else  sounds as dumb as me, chatting away about stuff nobody really cares  about. for twenty minutes. all to make a good grade. why is so much emphasis  placed on grades I wonder. they dont measure your intelligence. some people  always do their homework and make good grades. that me. some people study and  study but still bomb tests. thats me too. tests suck. especially true false  questions. I analyze those too much until I confuse myself. kevin doesnt have to  study and aces every test. no fair. well looks like my time is up. if anyone  actually read this, sorry. fun job huh. I guess youve read much weirder  stuff than this anyway. well adios. "
Tell me about yourself.,Trying to track my thoughts. That's weird because I don't even know were to start. At the moment I am wondering who just called because I thought one of my roommates would of answered it but they didn't and who every it was hung up. I am also worried about my food that is cooking in the oven. It is suppose to be done in thirty minutes and I sure am hungry. I kind of mad at the moment because the Cowboys just lost to the Cardinals and they shouldn't have. To tell you the truth its kind of hard to sit here and just type what I am thinking  because I not thinking of anything. One of my roommates is talking on the phone and being really loud but she does have a big mouth. She is talking to my other roommate and asking him if he wants to meet the person on the phone for lunch tomorrow but they never ask me but I don't mind because the guy they are meeting gets on my nerves. That was weird. An icon came up on my screen and said my connection has been idle for twenty minutes and will disconnect if I don't  click on the stay connected. I guess that means I have been typing for twenty minutes or maybe not. It is weird the way I have been typing for so long and I am just on the second line. I know I have typed more than that I hope. My back is starting to hurt from sitting awkwardly in this chair and typing  but I guess I have typed for twenty minutes so I can stop now. I probably didn't type that much but I am not a good typer and I make a lot of mistakes. I guess I'll stop now. 
Tell me about yourself.,"Today is only the sixth official day of class, and I am already stressed out. I know that I don't necessarily have to do everything in one day, but I feel  just so overwhelmed with everything that is going on. I wish I was already set  into the swing of things and simply taking things one day at a time. I get  nervous every time I think of what possibly lies ahead. I also have to start  looking for a job. I feel I do not have the time to work, but I believe mom and dad when they say it will help me adjust better if I have set things to do. I  guess it will also help me manage my time better, possibly even help me. I mean 5-10 hours a week is not a lot and it could even be interesting depending on the type of job I could find. I can look in to this of Friday considering I only  have one class, although I seriously think I should take an extra hour or two  to simply lay down and rest. I haven't done that in a while. What else do I  have to do on Friday?  Look for a job, call home, rest, read, do homework, and  whatever else comes up. Let's see, Saturday. The game is on Saturday, so I  guess I will do game stuff most of the day and go out after the game. At least  I will be able to get off campus and breathe a little easier. So far, I guess I like it here. I mean I am having fun and enjoying myself but I just got use to  doing nothing during the summer. No reading, no calculus, no tennis, no Stu. -Co. or NHS meetings. Not to mention the constant weekend out of town tournaments. Yet, I do miss tennis. Even though it took up a lot of my time and effort, it  was always a blast. I miss the team especially, and all my close friends. I am  the only one of my closest friends that came to UT, but I guess it is all working out fine. If I went with them to college, I would be at A&M. Naah, I'm OK here. I can always call them. I miss home. I knew that I would be homesick. Even  though I like being here, I sometimes wish I was still at home, in my house, with  mom, dad, and even Lori & Angie. Gosh, I never thought I would miss those two brats this much. OH, I miss grandpa and grandma and my nanny. I need to call  her tomorrow. It's already to late. I wonder what they are all doing right now. They are all probably asleep. I'm hungry, actually just thirsty. I could really go for a big, tall glass of sweet tea with a lot of ice. I can't wait for this  weekend. Hopefully I will be able to sleep in late, or at least till 10:30 am. Going to bed very late and waking up extremely early is just not a compatible combination. My legs are so sore from all the walking I have to do every day. I'm used to jogging and walking at least 3 miles most days, but walking here is  exhausting. Uphill, downhill, up and down stairs. Just thinking about it makes me tired. I need to get everything I need ready for tomorrow, but I think I am just going to lie down and watch TV till I fall asleep. I am so tired.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 "
Tell me about yourself.,""" Stream of Consciousness ""  Everyday about now, I am still sleeping. I feel good just having barely six hours of sleep. I thought I would be feeling more tired and exhausted, but It has not hit me yet. This morning, while watching CNN, and still seeing the coverage of Princess Diana, made me sad. It makes me think why everyone in that crash died and the bodyguard did not. He had ten hours of surgery. What pain I thought. I kept on asking myself why did G-d let him live. Why not someone like Princess Diana who did so much for the world and has two young boys to help grow up. She did so much for other people. She even raffled her dresses of for charity. What a women. I'm feeling a little bit tired now. The psy experiment I did today was a fun experiment. I enjoyed it. I sat next to a cute girl. I hope today's classes will go fast. I would like to take a nap today. Just to sleep and rest for an hour. It was nice seeing one of my brothers in my fraternity on campus today. It was a nice surprise. Also, I saw one of my friends from home on campus. It is exciting walking home from campus or going a different route because of the unexpected people you see or new or old friends you see. My mother went on business and I hope she is doing well. I hope she got well rested today. I hope to talk with my sister and she how well she is doing. I try to put myself in a better mood everyday. I think about a lot of things and it gets me worried. An example is I worry about friends, family, grades, whether I am behind or don't understand something in a class. I also do not like change. I don't like a change in atmosphere or any change whatsoever. Like going home this summer was hard because of a change in atmosphere and a change in obeying my parents again with a curfew etc. I try to get along with all my fraternity brothers, but sometimes I feel it is harder than normal. I spoke with my mother and she says you can't be friends with everyone. I have so much to thank for but I feel that I am always asking G-d to help me in a situation. I enjoy life and enjoy the pleasures it gives me. I enjoy school and friends. I feel everyone has there moods and their times they feel good and bad. I had a very rough summer due to the fact that I had irritable bowel syndrome. It was very painful and I did not like the pain. A doctor prescribed me some medication. What upsets me is that one of my friends I feel is rude at times. I feel this because last night he was rude when I went to his room and he started yelling that I was disturbing his speech. I continue to be nice to him. I am always debating whether or not to be nice to him. He can be nice at times, but a jerk at other times. I feel that he maybe insecure and have no real friends. Sometimes I'm angry at him and sometimes I'm not. Sometimes I feel sorry for him and sometimes I don't. I walked into my fraternity house this morning and saw our cleaning man. The fraternity buys all his children gifts for Christmas and I think it's nice. Sometimes I feel sorry for him. He is a nice man. I also feel sad sometimes because I wish the relationship with me and my father would be better. I do not get along with him very well. Sometimes I get very upset thinking about it. I often thank G-d that I have an excellent relationship with my mother and my uncle and sister. I miss my dog. He is so cute. I didn't spend that much time with him this summer and forgot to ask my parents how he is doing. Usually I hear him barking when I am on the phone with my parents, but I have not heard him recently. When I visit home in a couple of weekends, I would like to spend a little time with him. He is a very nice and loving pet. He is old but still wild. I hope my girlfriend comes home with me. She said she would. Her father is coming up to Austin on Thursday and we are going to dinner with him. This makes me a little bit nervous, but who wouldn't be ? I think. I miss my family. They are coming up for parents weekend which should be nice. I hope to go to the football game this weekend, some of my friends drew tickets for the game already. I have not given my ID to anyone. I will call up some friends tonight and see if they want to go. Sometimes it is hard to ask my frat bros if they are going etc. Maybe I won't go to the game-- it is a good time to relax. I will see. I hope to watch Melrose Place tonight. I have a lot of homework but I hope to watch it anyway. I have a lot of reading to do and I hope I complete. I think I will or come very close to it. I sometimes do not feel 100 percent. Right now I am getting a little tired. I think I might nap after lunch. I think we are having steak today. I usually think of steak for dinner but I guess it is okay. Yesterday I read for a long time. I didn't get as much reading done as I would of liked, but I am trying to keep up and I understand most of the information in the readings. I have to buckle myself down and get my priorities straight. Maybe I won't go to the game and instead study for my classes. I would get a lot done because no one would be here. I am more tired now. I hope today's classes go fast and I have plenty of time to do work undisturbed!! I hope to see my girlfriend and not argue with her. She is truly my best friend. Guy or Female -- I think she is my best  friend. Another best friend is my friend Traylyn. He is nice and I have known him since third grade. I am probably going to pray later today. I was hoping to do it this morning but couldn't get myself to wakeup extra early to do so. "
Tell me about yourself.,"It is now 12:32 and so I cannot wait until 12:52 because at that time my writing will be done. I type slowly anyway so I shouldnt have too much trouble typing for twenty minutes and producing much of a paper. I am not thinking about much at the moment except for the fact I am hungry and stressed out. The first week or two of school seemed pretty easy and then all of the sudden, yesterday it hit me. I am in college and at this point I need to get my priorities straight. I am enjoying myself too much and need to have more focus. My mind is just wondering a million miles a minute about nothing in particular. I need a job, but Im so busy with school and stuff with my sorority, which is another story. I am not the proudest to be in a sorority. Don't get me wrong, it's a great honor and a fun time, but I don't like the whole association that comes with it. My whole life does not revolve around guys and partying and allowing myself no friends or life outside of the sorority, as many of them do. In fact, I like so many people outside my sorority and would like to get to know them better that it makes me wonder if this is a good, more importantly, healthy fit for me?  I love Austin because of it's diversity and that became one of the main factors in choosing schools between SMU and here. There are so many interesting people and I want to get to know them all or at least try. Wow, it's already been over 10 minutes and this has not been too hard. I used to write daily in my journal at home, but havent had too much spare time to do that here, so maybe that is why I have been able to do this, and express myself so well. I enjoy so much being able to express myself on paper, which may explain why I write so much-journal, letters, poems. It helps me gain a sense of relief and since I don' express my feelings out loud too often, I need to do this daily, if not more so I can release all that I feel. I am excited about doing psychology this year because I hope to decide between the two majors I am struggling with. I am at the moment down for premed/nutrition and I really do want to go into medicine, but I've also always been interested in criminal psychology. It may be a little depressing, but I find it very interesting, and definitely want a job I love. A few months back, I read Helter Skelter and this encouraged my psychology path a little more, so I am hoping this class will help with my decision making. I guess we'll see. It is 12:51 now and time for me to stop. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Such a new, big place to be. So many people to meet and things to do. I  hope it all turns out alright. This is such an important time in my life. Hopefully I will do well in school and also have a tremendous amount of fun. I have already met so many people that I can't even remember all their names. This is such a confusing time for me. Trying to settle on a new group of friends  and trying to fit in. Because I joined a fraternity I don't think making friends  will be a big problem, but I still don't feel totally comfortable with them yet. Everyone tells me that those will be my best friends four the next few years and   probably for the rest of my life and I hope they're right. I can't wait for   longhorn football season to start. I've been such a huge fan all my life and now  I am finally able to go to the games as a student. I'm trying to think of  something else to talk about. Oh, I got it. My girlfriend and I just had our   one year anniversary today. I feel really bad because we could not really go out. I did bring her breakfast in bed though. she gave me the most amazing present I   have ever gotten. it was a book she put together of pictures and other things   that we have done together over the past year. I almost cried because she put   so much time effort and love into it. I just glanced at my clock and I only  have a few more minutes to keep on writing. Ill finish up by talking about  school. I hope I start off my college career off with a good semester and then  keep it going throughout my college career. That would then lead to many good  career opportunities and a happy, successful life.      "
Tell me about yourself.,"Wow! I cant believe that Brian still hangs around here. That idea about the red churches in England is really outrageous. The queen will never go for it. Anyway it was random of me to have seen him. I havent seen him since Joe played. Our power went out at the dorm and it really sucks. I waned to this assignment there but I obviously couldnt. The rain today was so random. It was sunny then light again. My dorm seems o be the only one that lost power though. This keyboard is sticky and I don't like it very much. I cant wait till the weekend. At least I donut have too much work to do immediately. Most of it is due Tuesday. That boy is sooo cute. I donut understand why all of the cute ones are jerks 99 percent of the time. Can we say Josh?  He totally ignored me at that party but he e-mailed Ilse for my number What's up with that? Jerk. I wish he would just make it easier on he both of us and just give me a call. Hello it's not that hard. I hope I meet some new guys soon cause these sure arent doing the job, I wouldnt mind seeing Jordan again. He is sooooo hot. However I know that I could never have a good relationship with a boy like that. Shit, I couldnt even hold Steven's attention. Then again he's a jerk. Anyway, I wonder how the boys are doing in apartment life. I just donut see them all living out on their own. I wonder how James and Julie are doing at A&M ?  They should be coming down for a weekend soon enough. I guess Adi would call me if she's planning to come back any time soon. it is really convenient having been from here. I already know my way around and I know so many people. it is awesome. I cant believe my roommate was so loud last night when I was obviously trying to sleep. That is totally inconsiderate and she knows that I have an eight oclock. I'm never loud when I have to get up at seven in the freakin morning, I feel like I should be loud sometime just to get my point across,  I donut want to be rude to he though because I have to live with her a whole year and I might as well make the most of it Anyway my twenty minutes is over so I'm out. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Today my aunt Caroline came up to visit me. she was on a trip out here for business meetings. She told me a bunch of stories about her life at UT when she went here 25 years ago. she told that she was almost raped by a serial rapist the police had been trying to catch for two years. He had been stalking her for weeks, and she never even knew. the only other person I knew who this had happened to is a friend of mine who had an abusive boyfriend who would rape her on a daily basis. she's finally doing a lot better, but still has kind of a loser boyfriend. guys are just weird that way. I've been going out with the same guy for close to two and a half years now, and it looks like we might get married!  I'm really excited about that, we've had lots of plans about various things, but I don't know. we want a house and kids and that whole thing. today in art class, one lady had a quilt as her piece to express an emotion and it really brought me that sense of home. It was so pretty, it had a floral design, but also had these powder green and white solid pieces. It really made me feel at home and almost at my grandma's house. she's got a quilt her mother made, and it is about seventy years old. It was made from material of old clothes that no one fit into anymore. Their family was so incredibly poor that they lived out in the countryside, and worked in the fields. my grandmother has told stories of her life, some gruesome and some amazing. she used to be the one to cut off the heads of the chickens they ate, and it was nothing to her just normal. other times she can remember riding through the country side on her horse where there are now huge freeways and shopping centers. I often wonder what it would be like living back then. she gave me a magazine clipping of how life was like as a teacher back then (she was a teacher, and I am going to be a teacher) and Im am really glad that we are well on our way into the twenty first century!  they used to not be able to be married, have children, they had to go to church every Sunday, clean the classroom at least once a week on their hands and knees with a hand brush, and all these other gruesome things. the only thing I have to worry about are the guns and cuts that go on in the schools (maybe it would be better to go back to the old days, huh?)  I want to be an art teacher, but Im not sure how that will all work out. my major will allow me to be an artist but with an all-level teaching certificate on the side. so. I can either be a starving artist or a starving teacher!  (both kind of sad)  however, I don't really want to have to be out there working, Im more of a homebody, and want to be the typical housewife. everyone I know thinks Im crazy, but that has been my goal (perhaps ""dream"" is too strong a word) ever since I can remember. I have also wanted five children since the time I was about eight years old. I actually come from a family of four children, so maybe the fifth I want is an unconscious way of somehow ""outdoing"" my parents. that has often worried me because it's kind of what it sounds like, but I really don't feel that way. my parents were actually the ones who first brought it up, so I don't know. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I do not know what to write about for twenty minutes. It took me so long to get a computer at this place, and I would like to E-mail my best friend in Arizona since I never get to see her. Well, I guess this is the coolest assignment that I have had so far since it doesn't require any thinking- well, it actually does. in fact, that's all this assignment is about. But, I mean it is not hard. I am really worried about my classes this semester. I feel like I have been going to school here for a while, but it has only been a week. I have a lot of reading to do. I think my classes are not too hard, but I KNOW THAT THEY WILL GET HARDER, I JUST HOPE THAT I DO WELL. Oops, I just turned the caps lock key, sorry!  Well, I am now thinking about what I should eat for dinner. I am also thinking that I don't want to gain the freshman-15. I eat pretty healthy food in the cafeteria, but I eat a lot more than I did at home. but I guess since all of my classes are miles away from each other, I will be OK. My boyfriend is coming to see me sometime soon, I wish that he was here right now. I hope that he is doing OK because I wonder about him. He's always changing his mind about our whole relationship- whether he thinks it will work out or not. One minute, he is all for it, and another, he thinks it will never work because we are too far away from each other. Anyway, all I know is that I really care about him, and that I have to leave the rest up to God to figure out. I feel really exhausted right now because I only got 6 hours of sleep last night, and then I woke up and went to class after a cup of coffee, something I think I'll have to get used to drinking now that I am here. that's one thing I really miss about College Station, though (even though there can't possibly be that much to miss in a town like that except for the people)  I miss the Java shakes I used to get at Sweet Eugene's, this coffee house I love so much. I thought that by coming to Austin, I would surely find a replacement for the Java shake, with all of the many coffee houses here, but I have yet to find something to beat it. Although I did find this shake called a ""Skinny Banana Espresso Shake"" at a coffee house on the drag called Metro. My really good friend Maria and I go there every Friday now to get one- it's like one of our new little Austin rituals, so we can make sure to stay close by seeing each other once in a while, and making an outing of it. It's really weird though how people you least expect to get so close to, you end up not being able to live without seeing!  Maria and I haven't ever been this close, but lately, we have so much in common. I just hope this isn't one of those ""since you're from my hometown, let's be best friends until I meet some other people"" kind of thing. Ok I have about six minutes left,  this is actually pretty cool, getting to know how my mind works and all. I already realize how many different topics my mind changes to in just 20 short minutes. I wish my mind did not wander off so many times, because that's really not good for my grades. Like sometimes in class, I will sit there thinking of my boyfriend instead of listening. But, then I go back to paying attention until I start wondering how my dog is doing all alone at home. Well, actually, I haven't thought about my dog during a class yet, but it could happen. Besides, I wanted to bring her up in some way in this little writing experiment, and that was the best way that I could think of. Anyway, as I was saying, I really hope that my dog does not die early since it is do lonely right now. My mom says she just sits on the staircase waiting for somebody to come home- that would be me or my brother. Ok, now I am thinking about me brother, who is the sweetest guy on earth. I hope that he is doing Ok right now. I thought that now that we live in the same city and all, we would actually get to see each other more, but we are so busy, I really don't get to see him until the weekends. Anyway, I don't know what I would do if he wasn't here to help me out. For example, I wouldn't have even known about this big computer lab. well, I am sure that I would have found out somehow, but I didn't have to find out myself. I mean, I don't want to be all dependent on him or anything, but I learn a lot from him, and I learn a lot on my own, too. Well, I think that my twenty minutes are up now. So maybe I will submit this and E-mail my friend Jimena. Or, maybe I won't. "
Tell me about yourself.,I just wrote for about  18 minutes and I accidentally cleared it all so Im just going to write poetry.      good enough. hey your glass is empty its a hell of a long way home . why  dont you let me take you its no good to go alone. I never would have opened up but you seemed so real to me. after all the bullshit I've heard its refreshing not to see. I dont have to pretend . she doesnt expect it from me. so dont tell me why I havent been good to you. dont tell me I havent been good to you. just tell me why nothing is good enough                                                                                hey little girl would you like some candy . momma said its ok. the door is open come on outside . no I cant come out to play . its not the wind that cracked your shoulder . whos there that makes you so afraid youre shaking to the bone . you know I dont understand you deserve so much more than this so just tell me why hes never been good to you dont tell me why hes never been there for you. ill tell you that why is simply not good enough. I can be good to you and I will be there for you and ill show you why your so much more than good enough. that was just some stuff I made up in my head I hope it is what you were looking for in this stuff. 
Tell me about yourself.,"This is my stream of consciousness writing for psychology class. I'm going to use periods and capitalize out of habit O. K. I had a dream two nights ago and I was at some Hollywood awards ceremony. This lady introduced me to kirstie Allie as I was sitting at a table. I looked over, and it was not Kirstie Allie but Andie Mcdowell, some other actress. Anyway, it was weird. Then on the very next night after that dream, I was watching a movie on T. V. and she was in it. I rarely see her on T. V. and I was astonished. It is very relevant, because I am reading a book right now called the Celestine Prophecy. This book is very cool. It talks about some ancient manuscript found in Peru that is going to change every human beings consciousness. It is very involved, but the first insight in this manuscript says that at the end of the 20th century people are going to become more and more aware of these coincidences. It is amazing because I have been having many of these lately such as that dream. Also, on the way over here  I turned on my car, and I thought of this song by Jewel. I turned the station and that song was on the radio. Unbelievable, right?  I don't think so, man,/. this kind of thing happens to me all the time. Ok I finished a focus question for history class before I came here and I also watched Seinfeld. It was the one where Jerry picks up a deaf lineswoman at a tennis match. George makes a mess of himself with an ice-cream sundae and they get it on T. V. Georges girlfriend breaks up with him and he doesn't know why then Kramer tells George alright I'm not gonna sit here and talk about Seinfeld for 20 minutes. I am so happy like not really just kidding alright wrong here we go alright You are all just a bunch of hacks. Lets get ready to rumble in the Bronx Joy boy girl swirl pearl grapes of wrath. Nietzche's theory on Dionysus man Let's call ourselves the Doors man. Like the doors in your mind, acid. Aldous Huxley. When the doors of perception are cleansed, we will see things as they truly are, immaculate. That was a line from Oliver stones, The Doors good flick. It is total irony how Jim Morrison has a poem where he says, Did you have a good life when you died, Enough to base the movie on. He must have known they would make a movie about him. Strange days. I'm taking Tai Chi classes. That should be very beneficial to me. I must do well in school this semester. Man that is a big deal to me Wow I'm really looking forward to the UCLA football game. It should be a good one. I really want a piece of glass you  know. My grandmother died last week on the same night Princess Diana  died. Was that some kind of luck, or what. I want to die at a reasonable age. Death, now there's something I could talk about Nope let's see Mi hermano no va a California para la funeral. Neither am I. Is that wrong, I don't think so. Man let's just increase the peace I can't believe I just said that There is a reason to live. We are all one consciousness functioning at different levels on the same paralysis of unending consequences of our reaction to the global warming issue in South America for the love of Peirre. They are going to read my thing and go nuts man. Who am I talking to. Sometimes when I'm sitting alone I think as if someone were with me. This is a good thing, for the love of my family is always going to be there. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I cannot believe that I am actually writing and doing my assignment on a Saturday. I am actually right now in a friend's apartment and trying to talk to a friend before this assignment writing, and I got nowhere with my friend. I feel so bad for my friend, Jimmy. He is so depressed, but he won't even talk to me. I feel like I should be there to help him out, but he won't say anything. I guess that I should talk about myself and not about other people, but I am just so worried about him. I have been so extremely busy today. I woke up at 7 this morning. And I had to go to a BASIC meeting, which I am very involved in. I just happened to be 2 minutes late, and now I have to do something very humiliating in front of everyone next Friday. I guess I don't mind if I do it to learn not to be late anymore. Then I had to go see my cousin and his wife for lunch. I didn't want to go, but I felt compelled to go in order to show support for my cousins since he is a pastor of a new church. I am glad that I went because they are my family and they helped to support me when I needed them most. Actually, my friend Jimmy, which I just mentioned earlier, totally bailed on me when I asked him to help me move b/c he had a truck. I asked way in advance, and I called him the night before, and I even told him that he could back  out and I wouldn't even mind. He actually said to my face I don't want to do it when I had driven all the way from Houston to Austin. I couldn't believe that he had said that! I was so mad! I mean for someone to make a promise and then say no really hurt my feelings. Then he said he would help, but only when he called an hour later. I got prideful, and I said that I would take care of it myself. Then I realized my pridefulness, and I prayed to God to break me down. He definitely showed me how I need to be more patient these days. I then called him back later and asked to borrow his truck if one of our mutual friends would drive the truck. Our mutual friend had before, but Jimmy somehow didn't want him to do that for some extremely strange and bizarre reason. it wasn't as if our friend hadn't driven his car before. I don't know. I then thought about and then prayed some more, and then I realized how he was nice enough to help me, even though he couldn't follow through with his promise. I went to California on vacation, and I had bought him a key chain b/c I knew how stressed he was. I put a little letter of apology, but he didn't even thank me for the gift, or even said that it was partly his fault for not helping to move. The fact was that if I wasn't living by myself, then I could have gotten more help. And if he said that he was too busy, I would have understood, but he  said that he could. Everyone said that he should have been better about the situation. But he is so depressed and distraught and etc. I wished that he would ask for help sometimes and try so hard to handle everything by himself. I know that he is angry and bitter and mad at so many things and at so many people. I just don't understand why he is acting this way. I also have a feeling that he likes this girl  who was an old roommate. Everyone knows. For some reason he is just acting more cranky and weird. we all think that he should just be open and honest. I hope that my (girl) friend can handle the situation well. She doesnt happen to know, and I don't want her to have to be stressed out about something that might hurt the both of them. I just hope that everyone gets better. "
Tell me about yourself.,"the end of this song is so weird. what was Andy on when he thought of it. now this song is pretty cool. it bumps. too bad my sax solo was gay. I think that funk is the coolest type of music. I can't believe that maceo parker is  playing at antones. I am so there. I can't believe I remembered the number man, I wish I could get rid of my damn computer virus. what a pain. my knee hurts. I so stupid for busting it. I think that my dorm room has to be the coolest in jester. jeff is such a pimp. too bad he sounds kind of white. josh is the coolest though. he's just about the funkiest drummer Ive ever played with. I don't know if Im supposed to be pressing enter, but if I don't I start writing off of the screen. I think that Im gonna like psychology. it's pretty interesting. I hope my stereo is bugging anybody. the concert tonight is gonna be cool. I just hope that I don't get killed. this song  cracks me up. I gotta leave in 20 minutes. I better have a lot of sugar to keep me awake. I can't believe how tired I was last night. maybe I should  have slept over at the girls place. I got to record my CD and send it to b. Ive gotta find out when I need to take defensive driving. these pizza rolls are so good. man, jester food sucks. the only good thing is the cereal. salads are ok. the pizza is decent too. my new hat sucks. it's really  uncomfortable. my brother is so whipped. me and my twin brother aren't really a lot alike. he is so disgusting when he's around his girlfriend. I guess that keyboarding class paid off. paid or paid. ly or lie. die or. . . well maybe not. what the hell am I talking about. this is a pretty crazy assignment. over half way done. it pisses me off when my posters fall off of my wall. CDs over. what do I want now. how 'bout a little screaming headless torsos. they are the coolest. jo jo meyer is the most amazing drummer in the world. too bad I can't go to the first game. I still gotta get that sports package. some much to do, so little time. almost done now. my mind has gone blank. Ive got to wash my clothes. if I don't do that tomorrow, Im gonna smell all damn week. Ive got to read a lot this weekend. this is boring. Im sure who ever might read this cares very little about what Im saying. oh well. looks like my time is up now. just gotta push the submit button. bye. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I returned to Austin Monday night at about 12:30 a. m. thinking I would be able to simply crawl into bed. Wrong. Upon opening the door to my room I was mugged by an extremely intoxicated friend. Her name was Sally and the source of her angst was my best friend Sean. They, as I am, are both from Houston. They had broken up their one-year relationship two weeks before they were to leave for UT. Unfortunately, they both reside in the private dormitory The Castilian. Unfortunately only because there is an exorbadent amount of tension between them, and I being friends  with both of them, am forced into an awkward situation. Sally declares she is ""so totally over Sean"" and is willing to forgive, forget, and become friends. Simultaneously, she has been extra nice to me, extra offense to Sean, and picked up a nasty habit - getting totally plastered every night she has been in Austin. She has a lot of frustration with Sean, and regardless of what she thinks, needs to find more positive ways of venting it. Sean's feelings toward Sally are fickle and skeptical. Sean addresses some  interesting questions Sally is unable to answer. Such as, why all of a sudden do you want to  be ""friends"", what do expect from our friendship, and why did you suddenly latch onto Bryan as a friend. Sally's motives remain unclear and yet she doesn't seem to want to  discuss any of the many issues at large. In turn, this makes the situation of the three of us living within 20 seconds of each other an awkward one. Am I to take a side? Most definitely not!!! I refuse! Yet how can I befriend both Sally and Sean without functioning as a mediator. This is one of the many issues that trouble me and make the transition from High School to Huge UT College life challenging. Thank you. "
Tell me about yourself.,"  It is Tuesday night, about 8 o'clock, and I don't really have time to do this assignment but I know that I have to so I'm going to do it anyway. I'm about ready to throw this computer off the desk right now because I am so mad. I have the most annoying boyfriend in the world whom I want to kill. Not really kill, maybe just hurt really bad. He thinks he knows everything in the world and he doesn't, nor will he admit that he acts this way. Everyone around him can see this accept him. It really bothers me. When I try to tell him he just says ""whatever, I don't think I know everything"" but he really does act this way. It bothers me so much sometimes that I get so upset and frustrated that I want to cry. But O well. There is nothing I can do about it and he is to stubborn to even listen to me so I guess I can either find a way to deal with it or not. And if I can't or if he doesn't change I guess this relationship will fail after almost 2 years. What a waste. O well, I tried. I guess we will have to wait and see. So anyway that is what is on my mind right now and I can't believe that I have been writing for almost 20 minutes. It seems like 5 or 10. That is pretty nifty. I like this assignment alot. It made me feel alot better, so gracias. I'm kinda worried that something might happen to this and whoever is going to grade this won't ever get it. I have really bad luck like that. I guess I'll find out at class next time. Hopefully my social security number will be on the big list. If not, I guess I'm screwed. I wonder if anybody is going to read this ? I hope not. I will sound pretty dumb. Maybe everyone else will to. Guess what the buzzer for 20 minutes is going crazy so even though it has been great, I must depart. So long till tomorrow. "
Tell me about yourself.,"okay I hope this works because I already did this assignment but some one called in and took me off line and erased my entire message. ooo frustration and things haven't been going exactly right lately anyway. Ooo this key board is really dirty, I should clean it. should what a funny word. I should do lots of things. Sunday morning, man it is hot. my ac was out for the last two days, but it is on now so this world is alot nicer. I am in a better mood. I feel relaxed this morning, peaceful. Sundays seem to do that to me, especially when the Monday is going to be a holiday. The fan is blowing on me and I feel great. I ran this morning 8 miles around town lake and it has to be one of the hottest mornings yet. wow, very sticky. I felt exhausted and sick when I was done, but nothing water couldn't fix. The radio is on in my room the TV in the living room and my roommates radio in her room. many a noises going through my head. Oh I need to change my calendar page tomorrow, I just noticed that. august is over, wow that went fast. each year seems to go faster then the last. I can remember being 16 thinking college would never come and now I am a junior and college is almost over! what happened. dishes I need to do the dishes before I leave today. I am going out to my ranch to meet up with my family for the day. Why is there chocolate in my bed? That is odd. The arch of my foot hurts. no good. can't have that for running. tomorrow there is a 4 mile race around town lake. 7:30 am. maybe Ill run in that, maybe Ill actually sleep in one day. I haven't yet. not really since last spring semester. It was the busiest summer that I have had in a long time. poof. Oh I need to write Andy a letter. I keep forgetting. It was nice to talk with him yesterday. especially since he paid the bill. That always helps. I have quite the movie collection going now I just noticed all my cassettes. I don't like this song playing now. hey the TV went off. I don't want to drive today. I am tired of driving. My relaxed attitude seems to be disappearing. I am beginning to think of all the readings I have to begin doing. I took 15 hours this summer so I am tired. what happened to that thing called break? I think it forgot me, but I had a great summer. can't complain, plus now I am that much more along. I am glad I did what I did. The list for Wal-Mart just was delivered to me by my roommate. hmmm what do I need or want, diet dr. pepper I have to have that stuff. yum, great for the caffeine. well the day should be one of reading and talking. I love the weekend life. Talk again with you later. Good bye. "
Tell me about yourself.,"After spending almost an hour trying to get my computer at home to work on-line, I finally got here. So what do I say?  Well, I guess everybody says that the first time that they do this assignment. I guess all that is going through my head right now is the advancement of the classroom. I am actually fulfilling an assignment by typing on the internet. I think it is pretty cool, though I am a little worried about what the future has to offer. The future is probably a real uncertain thing for me. I do not know where I will be in ten years or even ten months from now. Will college work out for me?  Will I change my major from Advertising to Design and back again or will I totally steer from the graphic arts which I so dearly love and take up a new love or hidden talent. Well, I do not know. I guess that it is all the future really is to me, just a bunch of questions with unclear and vague answers. It is probably the same way for everyone else, at least I hope. What else do I want to type on my new fancy Compaq laptop?  I don't know? As I ponder this a song I heard today keeps coming out and no matter what I do I cannot get it out of my head. And as the case always is I can only remember a few lines, while I try to hum the rest. ""Blue skies -- all of them gone -- nothing but blue skies from now on"" and that is all I can remember. When I come to think of it I really never heard this song today or anything, it just popped into my head. It is from With Honors, my most favorite movie of all time. I don't no whether it is the actors I like, the music, or the emphasis on Walt Whitman, one of my favorite poets, along with everybody else. Everytime I take a pause the song starts coming into my head again. When I really listen to the words of the song it is talking about your future, pretty coincidental, I might add. It is almost scary!  But that is what I am going to have in my future, nothing but ""blue skies"". I think that that is too optimistic for my blood. I am usually the glass-is-half-empty-kind-of-guy. And I do not know -- DARNIT I HIT THAT CAPS LOCK BUTTON FOR THE MILLIONTH TIEM AGAIN. I hat that when I am typing really fast and the ideas are flowing and then -WAM- you hit the caps lock button or some other button  that makes you take time and fix what is in caps or something else. To totally get off the subject or anything, but it is a really beautiful day out, today. If it wasn't so hot outside I probably would be outside right now, instead of in here typing this - whatever it is?  Speaking of being hot. It just me or does it just keep getting hotter as you walk all the way across campus for a class. Well I guess it is better than rain. I always want the grass on the other side of the fence -- my mother says to me all the time. I informed her the other day that I was going to have a better life when I become rich and famous. As I soon found out that I shouldn't have brought up this subject to my mother, because she spouted for the millionth time that the ""Grass is not always greener on the other side. ""  I totally do not agree with that. I just told her that I want things to be better and that you always need to strive for the best and I think that there is nothing wrong with that. My hands are starting to hurt!  I think I am going to stop. I feel sorry for the person who has to sit down and read this. Well I bid you farewell. And may all your skies be blue! "
Tell me about yourself.,"wow, I want to go talk to the socialist organization they have a booth out on the west mall, but I am scared. I called them a long time ago. do they remember? I was supposed to go to that march but I didn't I hope they don't remember me-as  not showing up-Ill go in a little while. I hope the toadies don't open up for rage on Saturday, the toadies don't deserve to open up for a band like rage-rage has energy and pizzazz. the toadies suck, they're okay. i dunno, that boy looks like Andy, I don't know what to write, I am trying to write whatever pops into my head first, I wonder what they're gonna do with this I thought he was sam, I  look around at people  a lot, I wonder what people think o f me when they see me,  I think I am pretty thin, but I have a poofy stomach. liposuction would be great, what am I gonna say when I go up to the socialists? hello? I am ericka, I called one of you before--was it you? no no no --I just have to be calm, why am I so nervous? my stomach is tying up in knots. breath in , gosh that's so lame that the wu tang clan cancelled, they suck, why did they do that, I wanted to see the, live- then I could say Ive seen them, Ive seen rage, Stanford prison  experiment, mighty mighty bosstones, pietasters, h2o, cherry poppin daddies, miss xana don't and the whatevers, less than jake, discount, frenzal rhomb, the impossibles. I have probably seen others, but I dunno, I like shows, Kim goes to all the ones I go to but I haven't even met her in person yet, only on the  computer, how weird the computer brings people together, maybe Ill write her tomorrow, or today, I don't have much time lately, I am sleepy, I want to hang out with people, especially boys, they are my friends more than girls although I am  one, we get naked in front of each other, we spit, burp, fart, we are comfortable or at least I am,  I wonder if they look at me like one of them, well I guess so, if we do those sorts of things. I am pretty much a boy, sometimes I wish I was, but I like being a girl, no not when it's time to bleed, but see, I can have a baby, and do other things they can't, I love boys, I love Andy, gosh I wish he was here so I could take him down to the socialist table with me I think he knows them, I hope they don't leave, I am going to go when I finish this typing thingy, I can type pretty fast, she looked like Chris, why hasn't she called me, is she in Dallas? I hope Matt didn't leave he probably did, I had a dream he left, I bet he left, he didn't say bye, I hope he emails me, I hope  he doesn't forget me, I hope he has fun in merry old England the princess' funeral is on Saturday, I am glad it's on TV. how sad that was, those freak photographers killed her. paparazzi assassins, he is nevermind. cramps hurt my body bad, but only recently, I wonder why---I never got them before. I am just unlucky what an unlucky girl am I --three more minutes of this, my fingers are getting tired next I will get on the list serve for my juvenile delinquency class, then I will talk to the socialists I hope my breath isn't bad I have chicken breath, but I was in a hurry after lunch. no time no time for picking my butt just do it I hope they're still there when I go down, if they aren't I dunno, I hope Jaime likes me, I kinda like him. I hope I have been writing long enough I think so  adios "
Tell me about yourself.,"9/8/97 Yeah, I've finally gotten around to doing this assignment. I hope I do o. k. Oh whoops, I forgot to check my watch to see when I need to stop. O. k. it's 1:50 so I will stop at 2:10. I just double spaced at the end of that period. I remember learning how to do that in my 8th grade computer class. Oh gosh, what if this is too short?  I'm a really slow typer, but this is really fun. The girl next to me is typing so fast, maybe I will be that good by the end of this year. There is a boy now walking around with a blank expression on his face. I wonder where he is going. After this I am going to my room and working on some homework. I like how the keys on this computer feel when I type. I miss my computer at my house, but anyway. This is fun, because I'm so used to typing in an organized fashion where everything is structured. I mean this assignment is structured, but our writing doesn't have to be. My left eye itches, but I'm afraid you touch it because I don't want to waste any time on my assignment. My watch just beeped which means that it is now 2:00, and I have ten minutes left. Wow, a loud buzzer just went off, maybe someone messed up a computer or something. Someone just rattled his change which reminds me that I have only a little bit of money left for the week. I hope I'm writing enough. This is as fast as I can go. I wonder if you really read these or just skim through them. It said this was a completion grade, good. I'll work on the other assignment tomorrow afternoon. the line now for waiting has gotten really long. Thank goodness it is air-conditioned in here. My left eye still hurts and is making me blink. I wonder what the others in here are working on?  I wonder what my parents are doing right now?  They are probably both already at home. I hope they find a place to stay for parents weekend. Gosh, that sounds so freshman. I only have 5 more minutes left. There is no way the teacher reads all of these. The t. a. must help. I like Scott. I went to one of his study sessions. My nails are long and I wanted to get a manicure. I wonder how many in the class have finished this assignment?  Typing is very therapeutic, I feel a lot more relaxed now. I hope I've typed enough. The girl next to me is leaving. I have 2 minutes left. I just checked my watch. I'm kind of sleepy. I think I will go to bed early tonight. Yeah, tonight David Letterman is on. He's my favorite. Oh, my time is up. I'll be back tomorrow to work on the next homework!!! "
Tell me about yourself.,"I just sat down at a computer in the lobby of srd, which is where I live. I just finished checking my e-mail since my computer in my room has not yet been equipped with an Ethernet. My boyfriend e-mailed me because he just got home. He goes to Baylor. He hates it there, though, and wants to transfer here in the spring. I am perturbed by the method of typing this computer is set up with. why doesn't it automatically wrap to the beginning on the visible screen. sorry, I can be really anal at times. I am sorry if this looks messed up, but I couldnt figure out how this works. sorry again. I sure am glad this isn't going to be graded, or else my body paragraph would get an ""f"". I really miss my boyfriend. I am nervous about my dance-team tryout today. I don't know if I am in good enough shape to make the team. I haven't danced in like four months, and I am really out of shape. I am adjusting pretty good I guess to the whole college experience. I have made many new friends , and already have done things with them. for example, my friend heather and I are going shopping at the mall at 4 to get my boyfriend a birthday present. I am misspelling words right and left huh. I am kinda excited about learning psychology. the brain chapter, I hear, is confusing, but all of the case studies should be interesting  I have no more classes today, but I need to finish reading my chapter one in psych. and my chapter two in chemistry. My boyfriend cam for a visit this weekend. I think he had a good time. We went out to eat at El arroyos, which was rumored to have good Tex-Mex food. They were right, alright. some of the best I've ever tasted. we then went to comedy sports, an improv club at northcross mall. it was hysterical. the members of the teams respond to impromptu suggestions from the audience. He stayed with friends at towers and called me the minute he woke up on Saturday. he came over to srd and  we went shopping on the drag. I got two T-shirts, a baseball cap, and two books from the co-op. he got some u. t. memorabilia to take home with him to try and persuade his parents to let him come here in the spring. he is going to have a tough time explaining it to them, I think, because they will undoubtedly think that the only reason he wants to come here is because Im here. I don't know how much weight that pulls in his decision, but I hope that isn't the basis for his decision. he started out at Baylor because they are said to have a good pre-med program, which is ultimately his goal. he met with the hpo office while he was here, and met with an advisor about the science program here. he was impressed that it was so similar to Baylor's. We then went over to the admissions office so that he could meet with someone about credits needed to transfer and other such items. He needs 24 hours to transfer, and after fall he will have 26, so he hopes to be accepted as a transfer student. Amy just walked in and said Hi!. now she looked at my screen I'm not crazy, I am doing stream of consciousness assignment for pschology. as she nods. she is a nice girl. she lives down the hall from me.  I needed to get this done today because I have plans for the rest of the week after Wednesday, since this is a two day assignment. I should've recorded what time I started typing, huh!  that would have been beneficial. Im retarded in that sense. i mean sometimes I have no common sense. I wonder what my grades will be like this semester. I am used to straight As, and I hope I can accomplish this in college as well. I need to petition my AP grades sometime soon, but I don't know when or where. oh, well, Ill look it up somewhere, and get it done. I need to do some laundry today, too. I am running out of plain little T-shirts, what's a girl to do. maybe Ill find something cute while Im shopping today. I hoe my boyfriend ( jaron is his name, if you wanted to know) likes his present. i think I am going to get him a ring from james avery and have it engraved. always. that is what I am engraving into it. so he'll remember. I am kinda sore from my dance class this morning. all we are doing is stretching but it takes alot out of me. I need to take a shower this evening sometime, cuz I am still kinda sweating from walking from like the stadium back home. in case you didn't know I live at 27th and the drag, so its a good hike to and from classes. I think I have been typing for twenty minutes so I am going to submit this. I wonder what happens if I didn't type for twenty minutes. what if I don't get credit. maybe Ill keep going for another minute. I checked my mailbox when I came in, and I didn't have any new packages. my dad supposedly sent one on Friday, but it hasn't arrived yet. I think I am running out of things to say, so Ill let you go on to whoever's paper is next in line. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Hmmm. stream of consciousness. Follow my train of thought. I guess I can say I've had experience with this in that I used to, and still do sometimes, write down stuff when I just had to get something off my chest. I followed my thoughts and emotions. It helped me a lot to get through some things. I had never really done anything like that until this past summer. I guess it was because I hadn't had anything bother me so much until then. But anyhow, I am not about to tell you about my experience; that is personal. I find it strange that I never really liked to write, assignments for example. I found it so boring and pointless. But now I realize that many authors write for pleasure, for entertainment, or to simply get something off their chest. But I guess you learn as you go. So far I feel I'm doing ok in following my thoughts, which have been pretty much superficial. Anyhow, I'm here completing an assignment, and complete it I shall. Besides, there are no right or wrong answers. Now, I'm just looking at the keyboard because my mind has gone blank. I thought this assignment would be easier for me seeing that I've had experience in writing my thought without planning ahead, but I didn't think I would have this much problems in having a subject to write. I just thought of something. It is something I had thought about during the summer, while I was going through the experience mentioned before. I feel that many people skip the thought process and just act with what they feel. I do agree that it is important to satisfy your emotions, your feelings, and your desires, but there must also be some thought put into a decision. Without this thinking process, a person could get him or herself into a lot of trouble. For example, if for some reason Person A decides he feels like killing someone, he could get into a lot of trouble for doing it. If he thinks about it ahead of time, he will see the dark road ahead. He will realize that he is just being crazy and that satisfying his feelings could cost a lot. And yet, I find it hard to believe that some people, some of whom I know personally, don't use this process. Take for example many teenagers. They got out with friends. They get drunk and end up crashing and in the hospital, if they are lucky to be alive. Had they thought about the consequences, chances are they would have realized that getting drunk was not worth it. But then, there is also an ""evaluation"" that takes place when this thinking process is used. In the case of the teenagers, they are probably aware of the consequences of getting drunk and driving. I mean, they see it everyday through various media. They probably realize that the consequences are pretty bad; yet they choose to go ahead and drink. They are willing to take the risk. They have decided that getting drunk is more important, or at least worth the risk, than their lives. It's probably that stage in their lives when they feel immortal. When they feel invincible. I was a teenager once, but never did I do the things that many others did and still do. I consider my life to precious to waste on one party. I have just made an evaluation after the thought process. I have found throughout the years that I tend to hold myself back on certain actions. I feel like doing something, I want to do it, but yet, my mind says ""Stop. Is it right?  Is it good for you?  Is it ethical?""  etc. , etc. I consider many things before actually making a decision. Although my feelings and desires might be held back for a while, I know that at least my life remains the ""right"" track. You will notice that my college experience will be a little different from other students. Twenty minutes and thirty-three seconds have gone by, so I guess that's time. Hope you enjoyed!!! "
Tell me about yourself.,"The first thing that comes to my mind is how unbelievably long the web address is to this web page. My gawd!  Now I am wondering if this text box has automatic text wrap-around, because, so far, everything is on one line. Oh, I guess I will have to do it manually, and hit return after every line. Now my roommate Brandon is berating me for not knowing how to format this text. Maybe if I ignore him for long enough, he will go away. My glance has caught the sight of the Daily Texan. What a lousy newspaper. It is really short, and the best-written articles are from the Associated Press. That's really pitiful, because the Associated Press writes the most boring, dry articles on the face of the planet. But that is better than the grammatically incorrect and content-devoid writing of the staff writers. I see that they (ah, the non-descript ""they"") have created a virus that destroys the AIDS virus in at least some instances. Supposedly, this new virus has worked in the testtubes, but they will not test the virus on animals until next month. That brings up the issue of testing on animals. I have mixed feelings about the issue. If only the animals were voluntary to (almost certainly) die, then it would be different. And if the animal testing ultimately leads to the eradication of a disease or virus, then, of course, it is worth it. But that doesn't make it any easier to do such a terrible thing to an animal. I saw a Twenty-Twenty about these apes who had been tested on and then were taught to talk. They were so intelligent, and so smart. They were depressed, and so sad. Poor babies. Why do I call them babies?  Because that implies that they are poor and innocent. I hate the ""dart"" board in our dorm room. It is not a true dart board, but one of those Velcro kind with the plastic balls that never stick. ""Bulls-eye!  Oh, dang it, it fell off. Never mind. ""  That is quite typical. I hate studying!  The thought of it makes me sick to my stomach. I hate to puke!  Just kidding. It's just that I have gotten a little behind in my reading for both astronomy and psychology, so now I am having to read last week's chapters just to get to this weeks. Needless to say, I could use some improvement in my study habits. And the astronomy is so dry!  What up with that, G-dawg in da' house?  You ask any G-dawg, and that dawg will agree straight-up, you know what I'm sayin', fool?  School tomorrow!  I don't even want to think about it, so I won't. Church went well today. I played pretty well, with the exception of jumping the gun on the opening hymn in the 9:30 service today, altogether skipping the call to worship. Oops!  Thank god my salary is not based on number of mistakes. No, actually, I usually do well, and, that mistake notwithstanding, that held true today. I must say, though, the sermon was pretty boring. Especially since I had to hear three sermons. Two is my limit, and three is just too much. Now I am singing in my head. I cannot stopping ""playing"" in my head the new version of ""Candle in the Wind"" that Elton John wrote for Princess Di's funeral. ""It seems to me you lived your life like a candle in the wind. Never fading in the sunset when the rains set in. ""  I believe it has been twenty minutes, so I'm OUTTA HERE! "
Tell me about yourself.,"so I am going to write this stream of consciousness thing for psychology and Im worried that someone will come in and think that Im retarded because I live at home because my parents won't let me go. If they read this they will get very angry with me for feeling this way but I don't understand why they even still try to control the way I feel. I don't really know what to say but I guess that's the whole point of this assignment. Which is not of what I say, but what I think. I hope this typing isn't too bad. Maybe I'll go back later and reedit it but I'll probably get embarrassed or ashamed of how I am. That's weird that I get embarrassed of myself. Maybe I think too much and am hypersensitive or maybe this class will help me understand myself. I was thinking about something that the teacher said earlier about everyone suspecting that they are crazy or abnormal as he put it and that's probably right because I always ask myself and others I trust which are few what is wrong with me. I know that there is something or maybe it's all in my head. I know that if I wanted to I could convince myself that my dad just walked in and yelled at me for shutting the door. What was I saying maybe I should not be at home writing this someone always comes in and opens the door or reads whatever Im doing. I hate this. not this, just my situation. I'll bet I sound pretty negative right now. I suppose it's because of school and my relatives all dying and my family but everyone's got problems right? I wish that I could talk to a counselor. I don't want to think about myself and try not to thing right now about that. I don't want them to see me cry and come in and yell at me or ask me what's wrong and tell me what to do about it. They don't understand. my being unhappy doesn't help them it just makes them mad at me. why am I so unhappy. why am I writing about this because in class it was said not to write about this stuff. I guess you won't read this like you said until a while from now anyway who knows maybe Ill be better by then. Maybe Ill have friends, but my family will still be here. I used to  wish they died but then I thought Id feel bad if they did. Everyone is dying. As my mother says, it's not normal to be happy all of the time, but of course she married my dad who is the cause of the problem so she is right about herself, but not me. why when I was a child, was I happy more than now. I didn't experience my father as harshly then as I do now. how would she know anyway, she married him when  she was 18 my age. just a kid who didn't know anything made to be a servant to him. wish  I don't even know what I want anymore. I wonder what school will be like tomorrow. what will I become in life does everyone feel like me. they certainly don't show it very much . I walk the halls and it's all so big and impersonal maybe its because Im younger a freshman or Im not looking at it the right way. I think that I'm too negative the phone just rang once. I wonder who it is. It's not for me because I don't know anyone I miss high school, that's weird when I was in classes I hated it. I guess I miss my friends. I wonder what he's doing now. I cant think about that it'll only make me worse. Why do I feel this way. I wish I could control my emotions like others and look serious and normal, not afraid. why am I afraid. I  bet you'll think that Im weird. I don't even care anymore. Why can't they leave me alone. Those psychological tests scared me. It was . like either write a five page paper or do tests. Obviously the kid would rather do tests than do a billion page essay. but who know maybe it will be fun. I just got a call  weird my only friend but I told my sister that I had to go and to tell them bye. Even when I have a friend I can't talk. I just wish that I who is singing. there's no privacy in the house. I wish that I lived in a dorm you shut the door and it makes them want to come in but when you open the door they feel like they can just come in and talk to you. if I shut the door they get curious like that time my dad thought that I was taking drugs in my room what a  jerk. why can't he trust me maybe I am bad I have done nothing that I regret but I guess I should reap what I sow. I hate consequences. who is that . I wish they'd just shut up. why can't UT give scholarships to live in dorms to middle class students theyre so stingy about that now I suffer at home alone traveling to freedom at school alone. I want to have friends but am afraid what if someone walks in and read this. I wish I could shut the door but that would disturb me and my stream of conscious like everyone already has. Who is talking. I don't know why they're all worried I think I need more attention but I don't know how to get it what is wrong with me what is she doing. I  wish theyd all leave. it's nine and I have to wake up early how much longer. I actually enjoy this it's like purging all of the negativity which I have alot of. This is a good idea. I kind of wish I could read other kids stream of conscious to see what theyre like. if they had the same thoughts and feelings that I did. I don't want to revise it you said it would be completion anyway so I don't have to revise. I want to sleep and forget everything all happened for a few hours of nothingness. then start over tomorrow and feel again. People would be so much better off if they didn't feel at all Less war and no jealousy. I hate love and emotions they only hurt you. and others involved. I have a minute left and just in time because my  dad might come in and get mad at me for staying up too late. theyre is never enough time to do anything Why am I negative. I  wish I knew what I wanted. what else do I say or think I start work tomorrow. I wonder if I can handle it or not. what if I fall why do I worry so much I wish I didn't worry. then Id be fine. who is behind me I hope I meet people tomorrow. I want to get all of my work done so that I can work but it keeps piling up will I ever finish do I have the time I hate being overwhelmed high school was so easy. they didn't prepare me at all. it's too hot. why do I complain all of the time I hope that I am doing this right it's not a grade but it might be. who is that behind me. no matter if I shut this door they open it no privacy no body cares they do but they don't show. that's dumb. What do I say next where are the keys for tomorrow I have to get ready what time is it. that's my timer cool I wish I weren't so tired bye  "
Tell me about yourself.,"My roommate won't shut up. O. K. Bert. My friend Bert was just talking to me. I better drop my Geography, because that class is boring. I don't even read  the book because it's so boring. I hope I can drop it before the date where I  get a full refund. My Dad might get mad, but oh well. I think I'll go home  this weekend and work for my Dad because I need some money. I hope he's working. My hand hurts already. I can't study here. I can't wait until I get home. Sometimes I just love being by myself. Man, my friend Matt needs to get a job. It's like I'm running a daycare center. He's always at my house and he never goes to school. He just plays on my Playstation all day. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well I'm not sure what to start talking about. It's taken forever just to get this assignment started. I had to set up an if account and all that before I could  start. I hate coming to new computer labs, this one is new to me because I just transferred here. I feel totally computer illiterate, so I start to feel like an idiot when the lab people have to go around with me and me  figure it all out. But anyway, I'm here now doing it, and I guess you always learn something from these situations. I learned that I need to get my own account set up from my computer in my room, so then I don't have to worry about coming up here and dealing with this. I guess we are just supposed to tell you what we're thinking about and our thoughts as they change. Well all I keep thinking is I wonder what you are going to think about my thoughts and ramblings when you read this. Maybe you'll enjoy it because I sound paranoid and you can analyze me! ha ha I'm looking out the window now at the trees, wishing I was out there and not working on this assignment. I still have fifteen more minutes to write. I wonder what everyone else here is working on. I'd rather be here doing this than doing the physics equations I was working on before I got here. Psychology is so much more interesting than the other sciences. Well now I have an E-mail account. I never had one before. I think it will be fun to be able to send and get mail. Especially because my boyfriend still lives in Dallas and its getting expensive calling each other every day, but it wouldn't be the same not to here his voice. I've never really been in the UGL before, I registered here but I haven't ever been in here to do any work. I probably should have been in here before now though! I think the chairs are to too low or maybe the desks are too high, its just not that comfortable. I guess they want you to sit up and have good posture like they taught you in typing class. There, I lost my cursor for a while. I guess thats why it says - Who knows I. Well I have to help cook dinner at my co-op tonight, we are having Mediterranean Turkey. I wonder what thats going to taste like, good I hope. Well my time is just about up  so I guess its time to submit my paper. I hope you never read these but even if you do I guess I won't really matter because with the size of our class you don't know me from Adam!  "
Tell me about yourself.,"September 4, 1997   I am not too sure what to write about. I am hungry right now. I have anorexia nervosa, so I not only am constantly thinking about food, I also won't allow myself to eat it when I want it. I am actually in the recovery stages right now. I have been battling this for two years now, have been in the hospital twice, and have had therapy involving nutritional counseling, psychiatry, and group therapy. The only treatment left for someone in my position is to go to long-term therapy. That treatment would be out of state (in Arizona) and would last at least 60 days. It doesn't sound appealing to me at all, but despite the threats that my psychiatrist has faced me with, it still doesn't make it any easier to eat. The battle is all in my head. It is my mind that will not ""allow"" me to eat when I am hungry, and it is my mind that tells me I don't need to gain weight, that I am not critically underweight, and that I am physically in good shape. The whole thing is very confusing to me. My psychiatrist has shed some light on the whole thing, but still no one can completely explain things like this that involve the mind. I think this class is interesting so far. I have enjoyed reading in the book already because I deal with this stuff on a daily basis. I am constantly battling my mind, and trying to figure out its trickery. My psychiatrist says that this is the best class out of all the ones I am taking this semester. (I think she's a little partial to the subject myself. )   I have to go see her on Tuesday, which is only 5 days away and I am scared half to death. She scares me with her threats to send me to treatment, but like I said, apparently it doesn't scare me enough because it doesn't make it any easier for me to eat. Right now, she has threatened me by saying I will have to go to the treatment center if I haven't gained 15 pounds by a certain date. That date is coming up in two weeks. I have had this agreement with her since the end of June. I am really very scared because I really do not think I have gained near that much. It's strange how I can think about it realistically and know that I am still not eating enough and then my irrational side of my mind will come in and tell me I am fine and don't need to gain. But, as the date comes closer to my appointment, I will start to gradually get more afraid, and get mad at myself for not doing enough. And still, that won't make it any easier to eat a thing. You have to make yourself feel totally like crap if you are going to get over an eating disorder. You won't want to do it, you'll feel incredibly anxious and angry with yourself for letting yourself go. I have experienced this a few times ( like in the hospital), but I haven't been able to do much of this by myself. It seems like it isn't worth it to let yourself feel so bad when you could just avoid the problem and not feel the anxiety. Instead, by ignoring it, you get to feel hungry, tired, irritable, you get to think about food all the time because of your low body weight, you make your family freak out, you risk losing your car and your opportunity to go to college. It seems that the negatives of not eating strongly outweigh the positives of not eaten, and I can logically see that. My mind is just totally screwed up, which the doctors say will get better when my weight and body fat percentage increase. I hope I will make it to the point soon. It's just all too confusing to explain. I am sure everyone thinks I am crazy, but you just can't explain to someone how you feel. I wish there was a cure or some more insight to it. I am interested in what this class has to say about things like this. Maybe I'll get some more insight into it (if that is possible since I live it!)      "
Tell me about yourself.,"I have a ton of things to do. I still need that book for MIS. I wonder  what Jon is doing?  He's probably waiting for me to call him back. Man,  I'm so happy matti called. I miss her very much, I wish she still lived here. I can't wait to hang out with Jon's sister and husband that should be pretty cool. The purple on this screen is sort-of pretty. I can't  believe it actually feels cool in this house, it's always so hot in here. I hope you go downtown tonight I haven't been since school started. I'm always studying or I have to wake up so early. I can't believe I'm not  swearing as I write. It's kind of a natural thing for me but I'm holding  back in case who ever reads this gets offended. I think my mom's home I wonder what took her so long to get home. Usually she is always getting  home from work early. I wonder if I'm going to get a bad grade on this because I keep pressing return, but if I don't then I have to click the  arrow buttons and that takes to much time away from my typing. Man this is getting easier as I go, I thought I'd start typing and just go blank. Why  do people ask so many questions?  I guess I do and I just don't notice it. I keep thinking of different things while I'm typing. Days Of Our Lives  was so good the other day. Carrie slapping Sami was awesome I've been  waiting for the day for Austin to find out that Sami was lying. Lucas  doesn't even like her anymore for not telling him that will was his son. My neck is starting to hurt. I would hate to have a data entry job, that  would get so old. It's so crazy that I asked Danielle about Mariell today and they got in a fight just last weekend. I completely forgot about  Mariell until I saw her best friend the other day when we went tubing. Tubing was a blast I hope we do that again before it gets to cold. I was  drunk as a skunk. that food from El Mercado was good or maybe it tasted  good because I was drunk and super hungry. I wonder how many students from UT are online right now?  I bet a whole bunch. I like this new desk my  parents bought for me. It's so much nicer than what our computer use to sit on. I need to start exercising. I have a membership at world gym, and I pay $16. 22 a month and I never go. But if Jon didn't work at nights then I would make him go with me. I hate going by myself, because it's  so boring if you don't have some to talk to or if you don't have headphones. My headphones broke so I guess I'm just going to keep making excuses until I get my lazy but up and workout. Right? Right. Well I'm pretty sure it's  been 20 minutes so goodbye. "
Tell me about yourself.,"  It has taken me a few minutes to get the hang of things. Meaning, I didn't know the steps in getting set up to use the computer because I really have never had that much experience in using the computer. I went to set my e-mail account  yesterday and also got my IF account number. Let me see what else comes in mind I have no idea but to keep typing. Oh ya here with me is Brandi who is a senior and is helping me get to know my way around campus and also answering any questions I have over school. I am planning to go to the football game this weekend I am still not sure, because my friends don't know if they would rather go to  the football game or go home to Dallas for the weekend. I myself would rather go to the game. I almost forgot that I have to go to my apartment and clean up and then I have to go to the bookstore to return a book that I don't need. Well what else can I write about. . my twenty minutes are almost up but not quite yet. . . I am here staring at other people in the room looking for familiar faces but I don't see one. . . . . Something that just came  to my head was that I really miss my family, especially my mom. My sisters,  and brother mean a lot to me too, oh ya my nephew also is someone I miss a  whole lot. He is the most adorable kid I have ever seen I not saying this  because he is my nephew but because it is true. Time up. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm sitting here typing again Ive got a lot to do today I want to get all of my work done soon so I don't have to worry about anything this weekend but I probably will anyway cause I always do. I wish I was a speed reader like on this movie I once saw -my stepmothers an alien- where the alien just stuck her arm in a book and in a matter of minutes she understood the entire content. if I could do that I would have so much free time to write and draw and relax . Im sure though that there are people who read slower than me. so maybe I should feel lucky. my wrists hurt again. and my head hurts kind of dizzy tiredness that I have to day from of course not sleeping enough last night. was on the phone instead because some times- especially when your tired and missing your friends- it feels like the right decision to sacrifice sleep for conversational anecdotes. but in the morning and now I feel it may have been a mistake Ill feel better tomorrow. after I sleep it will be nice to see Paul tomorrow. Justin is so funny -all the porn off his computer sticks in my head its so plastic- I wonder if anyone a long time a go ever thought that sex would be reduced to a computer graphic. its an ironic opposite maybe people are slowly changing- they are- to be more electronically oriented- I wont be one of them though I will stand alone. Mr. purdy too, he always talked about how overindustrialized the world has become and how it will eventually change back like in a cycle to the way it used to be- primitive. but I think his optimism is held up by a false sense of security most likely brought about by his memories as a child of a life with out computers . me on the other hand, they've surrounded me since birth so I cant see his 'cycle' but still I think its more morally correct to not get so swept up in industry - it only aids to the separate ness that everyone in our generation feels the nowhereness, and island like mentality- dad told me when I was little that every one is like an iceberg floating in a vast ocean and from the air you only see these little pieces floating so far away from each other, but beneath the surface, in our subconsciousness, we are all made up of the same water that connects us that we are surrounded by. so we arent really all alone were all created from the same stuff. I probably sound like a televangelist but I shouldnt care what you think of me anyway. I wish I could just cuddle up with Justin under heavy covers-warmth- and just feel his arm and shoulder under my neck and feel the ebb and flow of his breath on my forehead and slip away to sleep I love waking up next to him so warm - it doesnt even matter if we get married - I've thought about it sometimes. its what's now thats important and I love him and were happy if we ever do get married in a million years it will be because that will make us happy then ,whenever then becomes now. "
Tell me about yourself.,"In the background there is the movie ""Space Jam"" which is a little distracting. I can't help but focus on the comedy the Looney Tunes attribute to communication disorders because it was a topic that was discussed in my CSD class. It's a little too cold in here. My agent is not paying enough attention to me as of late, in agreement with a statement just made in the movie. I still wonder about my sign language assignment tonight. The screen on this computer is getting out of focus, then coming back in focus again. I love this keyboard. The spacing on the keys is wonderful. I wish my face would stop throbbing. My lips are very dry, and it's still very cold. I can feel the fatness in the side of my face from my surgery. the Newman guy on Seinfeld is in this movie. I hate his character. In Seinfeld he's funny at least. this music reminds me of aerobics and now the Eagles are playing ""Fly Like and Eagle"". Michael Jordan is a very attractive man. I wish I lived on campus. I wish I had a boyfriend. I gave the wrong number to my friend. It's hard to pay attention to the assignment and the movie , but it's not my computer so I must make do. no more basketball this season. I love this song, it reminds me of 5th grade and going roller skating. My best friend from 5th grade was really messed up. I wonder where she is now. I need to get the old school Salt 'n Peppa CD. I want a new car. I really want a nice car, not another piece of crap like I already have. I want a new Honda Accord, if life was perfect. I'm glad, this boy is coming over and I am very attracted to him. the movie with Kevin Bacon in it about basketball. I forgot the name, crap. my head hurts. you know that looking at anything that is emitting light, like a computer screen or a TV with the lights off it is very bad for your eyes. I'm hungry, I need to work out. I love the free rec center. My fingers hurt a little. I love playing sports, I love movies. I want to make movies when I get older, maybe I'll just produce. Actually I want to be rich. God, that mouse is annoying. Reminds me of my little sister, she always talks to fast for her mouth. This movie sucks. I am tired and I have to do that stupid Lab tonight. I want to go to an amusement park. I'm hungry. I miss Karen. I need a haircut. God that's Danny Devito's voice. That trips me out. OK , my fingers really hurt. the chubby boy? Who's voice is that? hey time really flies, it's good to hear Jenny laugh. I love it when other people are amused. Why is Michael talking about his butt. My friend Justin called me, it's very cool that I ran into him today. enough. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, my name is Robert Marshall Reinauer Jr. I am now thinking about what I am thinking. I am thinking about Physics. Physics is hard because I have never taken a class in it and the first one I am taking is a college course. Another thing I am thinking about is how long these lines are and how much of a page am I really writing. Did you guys set it up this way on purpose to see something or to tell something about us. Well, if you want to know something that I am feeling right now is that these lines really annoy me by being so long. That is o. k. cause I will just deal with it. I am also thinking about my home and what my girlfriend is doing. If she misses me and other things about her. I am missing her. Studying here is tough and so are the classes. But hopefully that will just make me learn more. There are two girls next to me and they are talking alot. Usually I get people next to me in the computer lab that talk in French and Spanish so I don't know what they are saying and it does not bug me as much. Finally the end of the abnormal typing line. Well, I can understand what these girls are talking about and I don't even really care but they are still distracting me from providing a researchable paper. It really does not annoy me that much but, I like perfect situations and that means everything goes my way. Unfortunately that does not always happen. Guess what they just left. It is really quiet and I can think lots better. Well, since I have been in college I have thought about the future more. Does everyone think about the future more in college. I bet the majority does. I am really worried about how everything is going to work out after college if there is an after college. I would like to become a big success and become a great doctor but so would a million other people and I know there is not room for a million other people which narrows the picking for medical school. I will just do my best and the hope the best comes of it. Nobody knows though what will happen. This is pretty neat turning in a paper on the computer. Finally another line. I am going to try to pick up another class because I need more hours. I hope I can get something that will help me maximize my time here. My counselors said that I can only take 12 hours which is nice advice but who has to go to school here them or me. I would like to get out of here as soon as possible. Not because I don't like it, but just cause I am eager to see what I will be in the future, a success or a complete failure. Well, 20 minutes is up and I have to confess that I have been correcting my grammatical mistakes just cause I feel better if I do. I hope you understand. Bye.         "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am feeling kind of nervous today because I only have one class and I am supposed to spend the rest of the day at the fraternity house doing chores. I also wonder why I have to do these chores, because all of the actives had to do them when they were pledges?  In any event I know that I have to go over there and it will not be fun. I am also excited because next week my parents are going to come in town and it will be the first time I have physically seen them since I moved down here. Also my cousin is going to be coming down here to visit UT and I am excited that I will be able to see her. People told me that I would be overwhelmed when I came down here but I haven't felt that way yet. Things are getting harder by the week, but I think I am handling it well. My room is a mess and I really need to clean it up and do the laundry. I guess I will today since I will have maybe a little free time. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I really am tired. I can't understand why I have so much to do and I haven't even started maybe I'm just lazy and I don't think. Could be I'm just a loser. No I'm not! I just want to be accepted for who I am and not for what I am I can't stand to eat Jester food. It tastes better when I'm already full. It makes me sick sometimes and I have to use the bathroom a lot. How many times do you think I can say a lot without spitting on myself. I like this song it  makes me think of parties, dancing girls. I miss my girlfriend, why can't I be with her. Too bad. Just be strong, If the person reading this actually knew me I wonder what he/she would say? Who cares! I don't care anymore. Just give me an A. Is that what it's all about an ""A"" we should try to learn something for a change in America instead of taking the shortcut approach. My fingers are getting tired. I'm hungry but it's too early to eat dinner What moron decided that dinner should be served at 4:30? If I get my hands on him/her, I would probably do nothing but laugh. Ha Ho Ha. Funny dude, that's me. How many times do I have to keep hitting the repeat button on the CD player. It's pissing me off. I wonder what would happen If our nipples were on our foreheads. I'm a dick for. A lot of people ask what's a dickfor? Funny huh? You probably think I'm sort of a psycho or pervert. Why won't this program automatically return me to the beginning of the document. If I get drunk this weekend I may feel better. probably not. I really miss her. She's got my heart forever. I wonder if this is the way I should feel. Who knows? I can't stand a cold shower. My phone just rang but I cant answer it because I have to do this stupid homework. I hope I don't get demoted for calling it stupid homework. Tired, sleepy. Do you know what time it is. I really miss my sister. She took care of me. She's only 15 though but she's my only true friend. I can count on her to do anything I ask her. Most of the time. Who knows If she gets married to one of my friends, I could be the best man. Who knows a way to type and answer the phone and do this stuff in one motion. I hope a little pause in my typing doesn't hurt my grade. I don't even understand why someone would even spell phone with a ph instead OF an f. My caps accidentally came on change the damn station roommate. He's gone. Black hole sun. Fair-weather friend. Dancing in the woods naked with a beautiful blonde wouldn't be so bad. She probably wouldn't want me though because I'm black. Who gives a fuck. In the goat ass. Colin's here he's hungry.

Tell me about yourself.,"Today is September 4, 1997. It is twelve days before my best friend leaves for the NAVY. He has come to Austin to visit. I have dreaded these past couple of months ever since I knew he was leaving. He has been my best friend for five years. We have gone through so much stuff during those years. It is hard for me to say good-bye, but I know I must. We said we would see each other in six years but how will we know. it bothers me to know that he will forget about me, but I hope and pray he won't. Ever since he has come to visit we have went out and done something. Usually we just talk. He has been the only person that has understood what I feel. It's like we have some unknown connection that I can't really explain. But I realize that time will go one and maybe in six years we will find each other and things will be  the same as they were be for either of us left. but how will I be certain. I told him that this is the hardest thing for me to do. I don't know if he understands it or not, who knows. It's kind of funny. Everyone believes that best friends (when male and female) make the best couples. And everyone always told us that we will probably get married, I don't think so. There isn't that feeling of that kind of love there. When I came too UT and began to meet other people, I didn't feel that I was loosing him, merely that I didn't think about him so much. But there were times that I missed his companionship when I didn't have someone to talk to. That is what Im going to really miss the most about him. He has the great capability to listen and help out, even though he is male. But I will always love him and his great personality even if he changes during the years. I believe we have come to far in life as friends to let our friendship fail. September 16, will be a very sad and happy day because he will begin his career and future and I will be missing my best friend in the world. "
Tell me about yourself.,"My parents just dropped me off at my dorm room and they are headed home to Houston. They came up for the football game and to see me. My mom calls me every day, whether it be to see if I'm up for school or  if just to see what I'm doing for the day. Gosh, I'm starving right now and my friend just ate all of his Taco Bell. I wish he would have saved some for me. when I get done typing I'm going to go find some grub. Oh, speaking of food, this morning I ate an awesome breakfast buffet at the Double Tree with my parents. I just got a computer; I don't know why I'm using my friend, Matt's, computer. His roommate just  picked up the phone and disconnected me. But, luckily I got right back on. I have so much reading to do today for philosophy, chemistry, and nutrition. I hope it doesn't take too long because I'm so tiered  and I want to take a nap. Every time I wake up from sleeping I feel as though I'm getting more and more sick. I'm on different medications for my asthma, allergies, and my congestion. The good thing is that I have a Doctor's Appt. on Friday. So hopefully I can hang in 'til then. I met a girl that lives down the hall from me named Jenny when I moved in my dorm and it turns out that we long lost sisters. Well,  not really, but we do have absolutely everything in common. It really is weird how alike we are. I feel so lazy staying in side studying on a sunny Sunday afternoon. I would love to go swimming right now. I hope that this writing assignment gets to Janel Seagal or whomever it is supposed to go to. Well, it's over and I'm off to eat!!  Good-Bye!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! "
Tell me about yourself.,"It is now 4:10 PM, that means I have to do this stupid assignment until 4:30. it's probably beneficial for the psychologists at this school, though. I think I am going off the page now so I will press return okay, that line was probably fucked up but that's okay. I wonder how long it will take to get on a computer tomorrow. It didn't take too awfully long today. I used to be able to type faster than this, I think. I  am out of practice from summer. I can't write as well, either. not that I was very good to begin with. This is going to seem like a really long time. I was going to say take a long time, but it's only twenty minutes, which doesn't seem like that long in theory, but it really is. I am not looking at the screen and my writing is going everywhere. I wonder what the other people said, and if they noticed that this thing doesn't automatically scroll down as you type. It's good to do this on the internet because it saves a lot of paper waste, but it's annoying to have to come here and wait for a computer when Im used to just writing things on paper at home. I wonder if Jonathan had emailed me yet-- I will check on that after I finish this thing. Doh!- It's only 4:16. I have a really long time. I wonder if he can tell whether or not people cheat and cut it short. if you can type really fast then you can get a lot done. I wonder how fast I type in comparison with everyone else. I should have learned how to touch type before I came to college. I still use the hunt and peck version staring at the keyboard. It's hard to do that when you're transcribing a paper or something that you aren't thinking of as you go. I'm getting tired. This reminds me of the simpsons when grandpa is rambling on and on and nobody is listening or cares what he says. ""ewww. what smells like mustard?"". I love that show. I can't wait until the new season starts. I wonder if we'll win the Simpsons house that would solve all our problems for the rest of our lives. never having to do what we don't want to do. But it would be annoying to live in. I think you can tell a lot about a person by knowing  to what degree he or she likes the simpsons. Some idiots like my dad just think it's a cartoon, but it's really so much more. I should really finish that chapter that I didn't read. It was interesting enough, I just didn't have very much time to read. oh, I forgot some of my books, and I don't want to walk all the way to the dobie to get them. it's so hot! I'm so lazy. no wonder Im a big fat cow, I can't even walk half a block to get my books. I should really start riding my bike again. I like the bus. it's so much easier and I don't have to carry my bike down those fucking stairs. I've climbed more stairs today than I have in a long time. I wonder if Ill ever be able to go running without dying-- I think Im just not built for it. Andy is so athletic, and Ill never be as fit as he is, and Im really just slowing him down. Yay, it's 4:26, only 4 more minutes. I wonder if you freaks are actually going to read all 500 of these things. yeah, what is the point of this  stupid thing, anyway? I could see the point of that research project, but not this. You can't possibly read all these. M back hurts. I should probably try to have better posture. but I like to conserve energy. again, laziness. two more minutes. Im tired, I think the sun drains all the energy out of me. Im really sick of this stupid thing, and the minutes are going by so slow. it's really irritating me. I can' t wait to get to my email! I wonder how many messages I got in the last 3 weeks. well, it's now 4:30 bye. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I don't really know how to start this but I guess it really doesnt matter Computers are so frustrating. I wish I knew more about them. Its 5:25 now so I need to write until hmmmm 5:45. Thats not to bad. I wonder what that guy keeps laughing about, It must be some really fun assignment or maybe hes on email with some girl or something. He pretty cute, kind of looks like the guy on  The Princess Bride. I love that movie , havent seen it in a while. This assignment is kind of hard because I cant type as fast as I think. Oh, this is how this thing works. Kind of annoying You cant even see what your writing! How dumb. I wonder what Heather is writing I hope my email got to Ryan and Jeremy. That would stink if it didnt. What time is it anyway?  5:35 10 more minutes. There sure is alot of people here for a Friday afternoon. I wonder if I'll be  in here alot doing homework. Probably. I'm kind of tired. I hope gosh I'm hungry. I hope that HOPE is fun tonight. I want to meet some people . I hope David comes I wonder if Trey or Jason called. I bet Trey did for sure. I wish he was more  talkative but he's really nice. I bet Heather kind of likes Dave. I wonder if  I'm going to be able to get out of this computer without having to have that  weird guy help me again. I felt so dumb. I need to do my research requirement  soon so I dont get behind. There's a lot I need to do. That guy is laughing again. I kind of wish I could just laugh back at him. Gosh I'm a really slow typer. I hope I'm doing this right. I wish all my assignments were this easy. I need a floppy disk and oh yeah I need to get those Paradigm notes for Zoology. I bet Leann doesnt remember to bring me hers. Oh well. She's really nice. I wonder where that girl is from. She has a funny accent. I think I've written for about 20 minutes  now so I guess I'll quit even though I dont have very much typed out . I'm just slow. Besides they didnt say this had   to be a certain length just a 20 min. time frame. I wonder whats for dinner tonight. I think I'll go find out. "
Tell me about yourself.,"As I sit here and drink this very nasty coffee. (coffee maker is on the fritz) I look back and recollect on this past weekend. In fact this has been my only thought since Monday morning. So I can give you can better understand what I am talking about, I will give you  a background premise to what occurred. I was sitting on the computer, as always, talking to my boyfriend in Houston on a chat group. He and I are still in that ""newlywed"" phase of a relationship, so we are constantly wanting to be around the other. My having to be a couple hundred miles away in school is causing major distance pains. Any way, I was trying to encourage him to come visit me for the weekend. He was regretfully working on both Saturday, and Sunday lunches ( he is a waiter, where we met this past summer) . He replied to my requests with a request for me to go down there. I thought about it for a brief moment, decided that I had no major plans for the weekend, and immediately called Greyhound. I was on the next bus home, in one hour. He was so completely surprised. As he put it, it was one of the largest signs of love that he had ever been shown, for someone to just up and leave on the spur of a moment, spend over $50 that he knew I didn't have to spend, sacrifice a weekend of my time, just to see him. He was on cloud nine, and as soon as I saw him, so was I. Well the weekend progressed, and I had a wonderful time. I also had a chance to meet up with my friends still in Houston, without having to report in to my mother. thankfully I neglected to tell her that I was in town. Well, on my last day there, before my ride to the bus station, he and I had a heartfelt conversation. He basically proclaimed his undying love for me, and told me exactly how special I was in his life. He also went over all the things that I did to let him know how much he knew that I love him. He remembered all the little things that I have done since day one. which really meant something to me cause I know that my actions are received with such appreciation. He felt that this last one, my coming to see him on the spur of a moment, was the ultimate. He then proceeded to tell me of a mental list that he had of who he envisioned his wife would be, what kind of person she would be, and what her traits would be. He told me that I fit every one, and he said that I was his perfect companion. Both of us have seen a lot, and have dated almost every type of person out there. I know that he is the one for me, I have known it for a while. I have been told that when you meet that certain someone, you will know it is them, and you will know that they are the right one for you. Well. my mind, heart and soul are screaming at me that Terrence is him. Well, I stated a few things to him that I had been thinking about, and at one point,  I started to cry, out of sheer joy at what he was saying to me, I have never had any one person ever express their feelings to me, and I don't think I have ever experienced love at this level. I was so happy that the tears just came. Oh. to explain the next thing, I want you to know that we have talked, hypothetically about marriage several times in the past. but it was usually never in a fully serious tone, only half serious. but each of us was contemplating it. When he saw me crying, he embraced me so tightly, and with such warmth I felt at totally peace, at that moment, he whispered (and I still don't know if I was meant to hear t or not) that he had ""finally found his wife"". he pulled back from the embrace, looked so deep into my eyes that it felt as if he touched my soul, and right then and there, asked me to be his wife. I was soo taken aback that I couldnt speak. I have never been proposed to, and wasn't sure how to respond. All I could do was smile one of the biggest smiles I have ever made, and I replied yes. He said that he was completely serious. no hypothetical at all. he also said that he would ask me again, but this time, would present me with a ring. I know that it could be a while before he can get up the money for that. but I am willing to wait for a man like that. I have never meat anyone quite like him. I have only been in love 2 times before. one lasted for 3 years. but it ended as an abusive relationship. the second was only a one sided love. He was leaving for the Marines, and didn't want to return the love because he knew that he would come out a different person. But both times cannot even compare to my feelings for Terrence. Now I come to my contemplations. I had plenty of time to think about my life and where it was going on the bus ride home. I know that I want to spend my life with Terrence, he and I share the same values, we are both religious people in our own ways. we may not go to church regularly, but we are both at peace with God and what He asks of us. I have never met anyone that was religious and not afraid to admit it, but he isn't overly religious to the point that I am disgusted. :O)  We both have the same values regarding marriage. in effect, neither of us believes in divorce. Marriage is for all time, and if you marry a person then it is forever. ""'til death do you part""  I know that this could work. The biggest obstacle that I can see is the age gap. he is 28, I am 18. It hasn't posed a problem for us before, my mother likes him, and sees that he shows acceptable behavior, and treats me with the utmost respect. He never belittles me, or disregards what I say because I am young. In fact he looks up to me because I have set such high goals for myself, and will stop at nothing to achieve them. He also knows that I want to wait until graduation, or at least close to it, before I get married. And he knows how important Med-school is to me. He also says that he will not marry me until he knows for sure that he can support me. he is one of those chivalrous guys, that believes that a man should be able to support a family on his salary alone. but if his wife wants to work, or even makes more money than him, then he is all for it. he just wants to be able to know that I don't have to work. At the same time, he is giving me more support about being a doctor than any other person. including my family.  One thing that bothers me is that he is 28 and still a waiter. I know that it is only temporary, he is working for a career in music, either with a band, as a musical engineer/producer, or as a teacher (he is one of the best drummers I have heard. and writes INCREDIBLE music. everything from piano pieces, to synthesized complete modern music. he can do it all!!!!  I know that with my income alone, we can make it. even starting out, being a doctor will be able to support us. The problem could arise in the fact that we will be in debt for a while, paying off med-school, and it would be a shaky start. But of course all marriages start out financially shaky. I am also concerned that because he is so much older, and more ready to settle down, that he will encourage me to marry before I graduate. that would just be another added expense. By the time I graduate, he will be 31. I just hope that he can wait that long. he says that he can, and that he will, I believe him, but he may grow antsy as the years go on.  Bottom line is that I love him, and will do anything in the world for him, but of course within reason. I also know that he would do the same for me, without even needing me to ask. I have never felt this way about any other human being. and I don't think that another love like this is possible. besides I don't want any one else but him. soo. Yes, I will marry him. and we will have beautiful children. We know that once this ""honeymoon"" feelings wear off. our love for each other will change. but as I know my love, I will still be there. by his side. I have never met anyone that completes me, and who I am, so perfectly as he does. not even my best friend. Terrence and I connect we realized this when we first met, and had our first deep discussion. In fact we connected to each other so well. that it scared both of us. and with reason. when you meet someone and the next week you can complete each other sentences. and already know what the other is thinking without them having to say a word, it can be a bit scary. But as we grew, we grew more comfortable with the idea. and now he is ready to marry me. my life couldnt be more perfect, and I couldn't be any more happier. I am in love. and now, I am engaged!! "
Tell me about yourself.,"I have to work at 1pm, go back to my dorm, and get everything organized I still have to do my geology homework and study that since science is hard for me. I need to go shopping for food also and get my internet connection set up. I hope my dad can help me because if not I dont know when I will ever get on the net and all my assignments are due over it. I also need to call my Brad in College Station. I dont know what to do in that situation. I think I love him but I need to date others--but who to date? I am not interested in anyone I only want to know for sure if it is Brad I want but how do I know if he really wants me when we go to such different schools and he will probably find an aggie woman I could find a longhorn man also . the guy I just met is pretty cool but I don't see me dating him maybe I should just have fun and see what happens no need to get serious yet-- unlike Lori and I do not want to be like her and Ryan. I am glad I didnt have to quit my job I love everyone there only my manager is driving me crazy with the shifts I am getting hopefully it will all work out but I have to work 2 shifts today and I still have so much to do I just need to relax or something but I cant until I get all my stuff done. oh well I wish I had time to tell my mom and dad everything that is going on here but things keep coming up people are always calling and or dropping by and there is no time to call unless it is at midnight when they have been asleep for hours its funny because you would think that since we live in the same city I would be able to talk easily but I cant tomorrow is labor day I wonder if Jeff will want to do any thing he probably will and I don't know if I have time or not to spend the day with him and if I dont he will probably throw a fit since he lives in san marcos but he can come home all the time if he wants or I can visit him I wish he wasnt so needy he has to really we are not together but he has always been like this that is why we could never work out not like brad though he is wonderful but he wrote me some letter I havent gotten it yet and he says parts of it are sad and parts happy I wonder is it good sad like he misses me or bad sad like he met someone else I will find out in the next few days  I wonder if Ryan got my letter and how he is doing I wonder how mecredy is doing and when he is going back to Dallas the George strait concert was great I wonder is they got to see brad I wonder how Lori is I havent talked to her in a couple of days and we have to do the draw together on Tuesday I hope she can stand in line with me and I may have to leave early since I work at 10:30 I dont know the games are going to be great I hope I get to go to the A&m game! I dont think I want to hang out with brad that weekend though I dont know it depends on him and who knows if I'll get tickets I really want to go though Tyler already has some lined up I wonder how you get to college Station I'm sure someone will give me directions I hope it isnt too scary I dont know what I would wear I wonder whose car we could take mine would never make it and it has UT stickers all over so they would trash it "

Tell me about yourself.,"I really don't know how to use the Internet and I have a feeling everyone can tell how ignorant I am. I really wish that I did not have to use the computer for my class assignments, its not like I will really have to use it in medicine. I wish my dad would subscribe t o the Internet at home. Oh well at least during the Christmas vacation I probably get a car if my grades are doing real well. I wish my dad had not held me to that deal, I mean what if I flunk out of math, my dad will kill me. Forget the car I just my hope my dad is in a very happy mood during the Christmas holiday just incase I fail. You know I am really scared what if I really do something to endanger me in to getting to the medical school of my choice, what if do get  into medical school and I happen to fail, what if I became a doctor and all my patients died on me will I be labeled as a bad doctor and have to forfeit my license. I really have to talk to the microbiology advisor so I can see what courses I should be taking and when I can fit them in so I can graduate in four years. You know what this is a stupid assignment because I am still thinking about spelling everything correctly and capitalizing, this even reminds of my psychology class in high school. Mr. ward was cool but his class was very boring, he should have known that because everybody was falling asleep and hardly anyone did well on his tests. You know if I had been a braver soul I would have blatantly told him his class was too hard and too boring it didn't even help some of my friends who to the a. p. exam. What kind of teacher is that who can't make sure all his students pass a standardized test he has seen before. that bring me to Mrs. whitenight I cant believe I didn't do that well on the a. p. exam, I suffered through out the whole year in her class only to not be able to receive a four or five. I mean really since I suffered and improved each and every day in her class I should have gotten a five, but oh now you know what I could believe that since she was a member grading the exams that she helped get that low of a score It sounds really silly, but who cares I don't have to look at her ugly face again thank goodness. and You know Mrs. Dubner should not try to cover up that she has thinning hair I mean thousands of women each year go through the same thing, if she really wanted her hair to grow she should have tried rogaine or something to that effect. This is almost over thank you God I never want to do this again but I have to. Yesterday my birthday was half good and half bad I cant believe my family could not have fed exed me a package ,it a good thing I have friends like Jean and Rosemary. I still havent talked to Dina and I could  not believe she chose my major after saying she would not like it, it would have been great had she told me the truth instead of me having to hear it from Regina the nerve of her trying to steal my major. I mean its not like it belongs to me anyway, but it seems like she going around my back trying to one up like so if we go back to Richardson she can tell every body how much better she is at microbiology than I am. I can tell you one thing she will never get that satisfaction I am going to work harder and work better then she will the only class she can probably beat me in is computer science and I can get me a tutor so I can improve my grades in that , thank you very much. I hope I beat enough so that I graduate suma cum laude(knock on wood) and she graduates cum laude or magna cum laude ( I could care less). Rosemary is a cool roommate , I sort of getting a little tired of jean I mean she complains from one thing to the next but she is a great friend I hope we all graduate together and become even better friends. Today I am supposed to start jogging I hope I can make it around the track once with out collapsing, that would be a miracle in and of itself I think. I know I have to call my parents I am especially worried about my mom I mean ever since the death of Princess Diana she has sounded a lot weaker on the phone I hope she gets over it soon. I hope when I am able to get home for a holiday they will have my birthday presents, I can't believe Jean and Rosemary got me a perfume oil for my birthday that has to be the greatest birthday gift I have received from anyone since I got my Cowboys' jacket from my parents on my fifteenth birthday ( in fact that  was the last birthday I got present from my parents at all. You know in the two weeks I have been here I have forgotten all about mike almer its a good thing too because I think I was starting to get obsessed about the whole thing. Maybe I'll see him during the Christmas holiday maybe I wont maybe I'll even have another boyfriend who'll treat me better any way I shouldn't be thinking about that right now I'll think about it later when I am about to graduate from medical school. well thank goodness my time is up its a good thing my professor won't really read this its not embarrassing I just don't feel like having anyone analyzing my brain waves or my mind thinking pattern, I would rather be analyzing someone else myself. I wonder what the projects are going to like I hope its going to great well I have to go so I can eat lunch which I have never wanted more than right now. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I finally got all of my Ethernet problems worked out today, so I e-mailed  everyone I know. I wish my mom would call so I could tell her that not only  did I get the package with my Windows 95 disk but I also received my Nabisco  care package. It had all kinds of goodies in it but I haven't yet gotten to eat  any of them yet. I wonder where Scott is. I haven't heard from him since Monday I think. He's probably at work, or playing Magic with Tim and Anthony. I'm glad  I got a card from Julie today, looks like she's having a good time at OU. Maybe  I'll call her before I go to the Red River Shoot-Out in Dallas, or better yet maybe she's got a place to stay in Dallas and I could stay with her. I wish the guys  working outside would be quiet. And for once the girls in my hall are quiet, either that or they aren't there. My fingers are really cold , but they aren't numb yet so I guess I'll live. I'm so excited! I get to  go to my first UT football game on Saturday. But I also get to go to all of the other home football games because I got Season tickets. maybe I'll see my Aggie friends at the A&M game November, Kristine doesn't have an e-mail address yet otherwise Id write her. I  don't think I get to go home again until September the twentieth, but maybe I'll get to see Scott then, unless he comes here, but I don't think that he'll do that because it will end up costing him to much money, then again it will cost me a lot of money too, if I keep going back and forth I hope that Im getting enough sleep to make it all the way through the day. I need to start planning my week like I  learned how at the time Management and Study Strategies Seminar I went to on Sunday I think I need to take a nap. I wish I had some nail polish remover, I need to repaint my toenails. I wonder if I can make it through three weeks before I need to get my nails redone. I hope so I dont want to change manicurists, I like Vicky. "
Tell me about yourself.,"What to write. I just missed dinner because I came down here to write this paper. I think that they should make dinner last longer then just till 7:00 at night. That sucks. Last night I requested that they give us a new couch because the one we have now hurts my back. Besides I saw what the new couches looked like and they are pretty cool. They are bright blue, not just plan gray. Grey is so boring. I wonder what I will do tonight. I could stay home and do my homework and sleep,  maybe get to see what a good night's sleep feels like. But I will most likely go out and party like I always get suckered into. So the guy situation on campus. Not to bad. The one Im dating now is a sweetie. But now that Im dating him it is not as fun anymore. Why is that?  The fun part is the challenge of getting the guy but now that I have him I don't want to spend any time with him. I am such a bitch. God, my eyes can't handle looking at a computer screen too long. They get all dried out. We have a Nintendo at our room upstairs, and I sit there for hours and my eyes kill me. Well, not really for hours, just a little exaggeration. My roommates are pretty cool. I like them a lot. Sometimes I feel bad because I don't spend as much time with them as they do together so now they are closer to each other and I kinda feel left out. But I spent my time with my other friends. My best friend Athena who is just down the hall and whom I love so very much. I am so glad that she is here. I would hate it here if she weren't. When I fist got here I was kinda upset that she was on my floor because I wanted my space and my time away from her, but now I love it. It is a perfect set up. I can go and visit her anytime I want and she can come to my room if she likes but I don't feel like hanging with her than I don't have to. How come I can write forever and this screen just keeps scooting over, it makes my feel like Im not writing that much. Last time I did this I only wrote one line. And the sad thing was I was sitting at the computer for about an hour. I just had people distracting me. I wonder how you check your e-mail. I wonder if Chris wrote me. Chris is such a great guy. I hope he comes down and visits sometime soon. I miss the boy. He is the one guy I regret not ever liking. I had my chance with him and broke his heart, but I guess that's the way life goes. I always go for the loser guys who treat me like shit. Maybe that's why I never like a guy after I finally know he likes me, he is too nice and treats me too well. Doesn't that suck. I thought that the psy. experiment in class was very entertaining. I hope that I do well in this class it is truly an interesting subject. But is seems like I won't be doing well in any of my classes. I don't concentrate enough. I came down here thinking that I was going to get a 4. 0, or at least close to that. But now my study habits have gotten so bad that I don't know what is going to happen to my. I think that I will change my ways and get back on track. I started out exercising every day too, but now I haven't ran in several days. The freshman 15 here I come. Ok that has been 20 min. Hope you had fun analyzing me! "
Tell me about yourself.,"It is 5:24 in the afternoon. I wonder how long 20 minutes really is and how much I can write. time always seems to go by so slow when Im bored out of my mind. it's too quiet in this room. usually there's people constantly talking, walking in and out, shouting, banging, or anything to cause distraction. you see, Im in my cousin frank's room. well, we're not really blood cousins, just cousins by marriage- his aunt married my uncle. anyway, he's pretty cool. I hated him when I was a kid. we were in the same Chinese class and he was one of those really annoying, obnoxious boys that always teased the girls. I guess we're pretty close now. it was pretty scary finding out we were cousins, but its fun calling each other that. ugh. Im so bored. the only noise I hear is the humming of the a/c which is right above the desk. it's hot, and the a. c. 's not cool enough to keep me comfortable. Im really paranoid about frank's room. he's a pretty messy guy, and someone just came in here complaining that there were fleas in here. yuck. I hate bugs of any shape and size. all I know is that Im beginning to feel itchy everywhere. man, it's only 5:35 now. about half way through this writing assignment. laddy da dee da. I don't know what to write. the more I sit here, the more impatient I get and the more paranoid I am about these bugs around me. frank lives inside an Asian fraternity house. Im not trying to say Asians are dirty, but sometimes the guys do get a little lazy. I wish they'd clean up a bit. even right after the clean, it's still a mess. it smells moldy, the lighting is really bad, the air is thick, and it just feels nasty walking in here. I hate taking showers or going to the bathroom here. the dim lights are constantly flickering, the seats are a dingy yellow/brown color, and it stinks like shit. and the one stall that's actually half way decent has no lights in it. I basically take a shower in the dark. and the worst part is that I paranoid about guys walking in and out of the bathroom while Im in there changing. all the guys here know me and respect my boyfriend, but it's just the thought of guys there. yes. it's 5:41. and frank and my friend Tony just got back. they're starting their own racing crew and just picked up stickers for their cars. mmm. and they brought back food. even though I don't like McDonalds, I always crave it when I smell it. oh well, Im just gonna eat some since my time's up. yeah! "
Tell me about yourself.,"  Okay, I am working on assignment number one in which if I understand correctly, I am to follow my thought pattern. I am thinking about everything that I need to accomplish in the next two or three days. This is difficult to follow because everything seems to run together. This happens to me every night when I try to go to sleep. Sometimes it takes me hours to get there. I have to actually talk myself into clearing my thoughts in order for me to get some sleep. There have got to be some better relaxation techniques that I should try in order to sleep, because I am always tired. When you are always tired, it is difficult to get everything accomplished because your mind and body just do not cooperate. I wonder how much power the mind actually has over the body. Maybe that is something that we will discuss in class. I find the topic very interesting. It is amazing how much more conscientious you become of your thoughts when you are trying to track them. It seems to make you lose some of the negativity or criticism that usually passes through one's mind. It is hard to think when you are trying to, but when you would rather not, you are overloaded with thoughts. Just what exactly are thoughts anyway?  I wonder just how the brain actually thinks. The human mind and body are absolutely amazing. They work so precisely that it is quite intriguing. Life itself is amazingly difficult sometimes. All my life, I have wanted to get big, now I would love to be back in kindergarten. Life was so simple back then,  Now everything is rushed and hurried and there are still not enough hours in the day to get everything done that needs to be done. I wonder how other people seem to do everything with such ease, because I definitely cannot seem to get away with doing anything easily. Maybe I will be a stronger person because of it, or maybe I will be insane by age 40. Who knows? only time will tell. I wish I could see into the future to know whether what I am doing now will pay off or if it is being done in vain. Time, what a concept anyway. I would imagine that the world would be quite chaotic without it, but sometimes I still wish that it would go away. I have been typing for a little more than ten minutes now. look at that, I just used time in a simple statement. The concept of time has probably always existed in some form or fashion, however it could not have always been this exact. I wonder who came up with making it the way it is today and if that person knew what a profound effect it would have on the world. I am already ready for Christmas break. I had an absolutely wonderful summer and cannot quite seem to put summer behind me and get in the going to school mode. I want to do well in my classes. I graduated fourth in my class and had a GPA of over one hundred. I made one B is first grade and swore that I would never make another. I guess college is a different thing though and I will have to wait and see how everything works out. It is quite an adjustment from high school. I was trying to stay away from this topic due to our second writing assignment, but my mind is consumed with thoughts about everything that is going on right now which is moving away and going to this absolutely huge school. There are more people on this campus than there are in my whole town. Anyway, I have been typing for more than twenty minutes now. I think my mind skips around a lot and jumps from topic to topic, but oh well, that is how I work. "
Tell me about yourself.,Well I really do have alot I should be doing right now but I thought I would get this out of the way and I want to do it early because I am paranoid it won't get sent by some freak accident. Anyway I really need to get stuff done. I need tp study for French even though it's a French I test and I've been in French for 3 years so hopefully I will do o. k. Some guy just tried to chat with me but I told him I was busy and now I feel kinda bad. Oh well he'll get over it. People in Austin really do try to chat with other people in Austin alot. The only people that try to talk to me are online. Maybe it's because I intimidate people. I'm 6 feet tall. I like it though because most guys find it really attractive. My boyfriend loves it. He lives in New Jersey so it really doesn't matter anyway. I really love him. I met him Cancun In May after graduation and he has called me just about every night since. He's even coming down here next month to see me. I really miss him. He really can't even afford to come down because he works in a casino in Atlantic City. That actually kinda bothers me. He's 24 years old. He really needs some ambition. That's something I really admire in people. I've got alot myself. I hope to be a producer someday and live in New York. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm already ready to graduate. I miss my friends from home. Hopefully I can see Jina in 2 weeks. I may go to visit my brother at A&M so hopefully we can hang out. I really feel like people don't understand me. I really wish Rich lived closer. I know he loves me. I went with my roommate to visit her boyfriend at Baylor this weekend. It was fun. I just really miss my boyfriend even more now. I really nee to read for RTF right now. I want to read ahead for this week. I just want to get out of here. I just wish I could pack up my bags and move to Europe. I do want an education so I guess I'll stick around here for four years or so. I need to call Jina. I ran into my old boyfriend the other day but I pretended I didn't see him. He is someone I will never get over. He had the most amazing mind. He is going to be very successful one day. I feel like he is out of my league. I know I'm not but he just never really understood me. I hope I see him again this week and maybe I will have the courage to talk to him. 
Tell me about yourself.,"Well I am sitting here in my room and it's about 2:30 PM. My roommate  is on the phone so it's not very quiet in here right now. Last week my boyfriend hooked up the Ethernet on my computer. After trying to get it to work we finally got everything hooked up. It seemed to be working, well all of the programs  were working but when I went to shut the computer down it came to a blue screen and my computer was messed up. It said a bunch of stuff about pressing a key  to terminate a program that wasn't working, well I pressed a key and the screen was frozen. What's wrong!!!!  I restarted the computer and shut it down again and it still did the same thing. Today I turned the computer on and it did the  same thing. I called the computer center and after being on hold for an hour I finally go help, well I guess you can call it help. He couldn't help me but he set up an appointment for Friday with someone who will help me. Hopefully I can get this thing figured out. I just bought this computer a few months ago and  it was very expensive. Well enough about computers. I am a little tired. I had an 8 o'clock class, after the class though I came back to the room and took a  nap until 12:30. I think that made me even more tired. Well I need to start reading my English. I have a book I have to finish by Thursday. I am half-way through, but there's still 120 pages to go. I hate reading!  I read slow and it takes forever. That's not very good for an English major. I should enjoy to read, especially  because I will be doing a lot of it in the future. I am a sophomore student here but this is my first year here. This is a big change, I am very close to my  family and it was hard to leave them. I am 2 1/2 hours from home so it's not that far, but it's still a lot of driving for the weekend. I went home this weekend. I was glad to be home. I'm not sure if I like this place yet or not. I think it will take a little time. At least my roommate is sweet, we get along good. That's a positive thing. The bad thing is that last night we found roaches under the sink. Babies so they're everywhere under the sink. It is really gross. I never saw roaches before so I freaked out. The weird thing is that we don't  have any open food, I guess the roaches are looking for the water and it's also  dark under there. We put a request in to have someone come and spray. They  haven't yet. I hope they come soon!  Well my time is almost up. This was really  weird just writing off of the top of my head. Actually it's kind of peaceful because I enjoy typing. Well I have my psychology class next, at 3:30 PM. I need to get ready for class. I need to check if they got the books in yet. Last Friday they didn't have the book in. Well my time is up so I will submit now. Until the next assignment. see you later!!!!   "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm so glad Lizz, my roommate, just left to see Brad, a guy she has liked for quite some time now. I think they should get together as more than friends, but sometimes that just doesn't work. I remember a time when a friend of mine turned out liking me as more. I don't know why this computer always makes some kind of noise like it's starting up even when Im not using it. Someone is very loud in the hall. They sound like they are having fun. wish I could join them. Is Ben thinking about me right now?  I wonder were he is and if he loves me the way he says he does. I wish I was a better typist. There is so much chemistry I need to be doing. Is there a party in the next room?  Cohen just walked in. is he up to something?  This room is kind of hot and I could really drink something cold right now. I just hate people who expect me to understand them when they're speaking a language I don't know. French wouldn't be bad to learn, though. Wish I was at Disney World right now. I just saw Mickey and Minnie on my shelf and remember the great summer we had there. Well mom and dad were fun, but Brandon was a royal pain in the butt. I even have Chip and Dale wallpaper on my PC. gosh, am I a fanatic or what. I think I just know a good thing when I see one. Speaking of good things, I wish I was good at chemistry so I wouldn't have to study the rest of the night and early into the morning. I don't think I'm doing this assignment right because I'm now to the point where I'm thinking of things to say. sitting at this desk is not comfortable at all. My hair is in my face and I wish it was alot longer than it is so I could pull it back. Jester is not a bad place to live except for the constant interruptions. This comp is a pain because the mouse is built in and I always hit it when typing. Who keeps slamming those doors. Doesn't anyone have homework besides me. I put too much pressure on myself to make my parents proud of me. This coo-coo clock on my comp just made a noise and the bird, Iggy is so cute nose itches. it always does. Does that really mean that someone is thinking about me. If it's true I hope it's Ben. I wonder where he is now. Is he going to call me soon. When I get through with this I need to check my e-mail to see if anyone is trying to get a hold of me. I miss Tara. She's the only friend I can really tell things to. If she came up to UT I would never get any of my homework done. But then again she would spend alot of time with my brother. He treats her so bad. I don't know why she puts up with it. I always wondered why people couldn't answer when I asked them what they were thinking. This assignment proves there is always something on your mind. I just hit the home key and it took me to the beginning of this writing and I wasn't smart enough to figure out to hit the end key until I scrolled all the way through what I just wrote. If I could type faster this assignment would flow a lot more smoothly and I wouldn't lose any of my thoughts while typing previous ones. I wonder how long it's been. The way I'm sitting here is hurting my back. I can't believe I wrecked my car and got whiplash. It's been two months and I'm still doped up. I can't even carry a bookbag without it hurting. It sounds like there is a guy talking outside my window but that is not possible because I'm on the tenth floor. It's been almost twenty minutes but this is kind of fun. I should do this more often. It got my mind off of chem for a while and relieved some of my stress. I'm such a basket case anyway, I worry way too much about stuff that I end up doing just fine on. The phone is ringing in the other room. I wonder when Ben is going to call me. If I didn't worry about him so much and worried about chem a little more I probably wouldn't hate it so much. I can't wait to go to the frat party this weekend. There are so many guys there that want to go out with me. I wonder if that's true or if Ben just said that to flatter me or to make himself believe that he has a beautiful girlfriend. Oh I'm so bad, I've only known him for a little while and I'm already second guessing him. He is actually the best guy I've had in a while. He is so smart. how sexy. That guy is still talking outside of my window. I guess I shouldn't be correcting my mistakes when typing but even my friends say I'm a bit of a perfectionist. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, after two weeks of trying to find a computer after receiving this assignment, I finally found one. Unfortunately it is probably in one of the worst possible locations, at least unbeknownst to the owner of this computer, who is-ironically enough, my poor neighbors who suffer through hours and hours of us ( the people living next door) screaming and yelling and jumping around until the wee small hours of the morning. I can hear the people in my room pounding on the wall now. ohhh shit, this girl who owns this computer just told me, not knowing it was me, that she hates the people who live next door (ahhhh!)  I am smiling now. I always find irony amusing. They are still pounding next door. What the hell are they doing. HE HEHEEHEH-they just called us the 'Fort Worth Girls'  now that's funny stuff. I seriously have a major stomach ache. It hurts soo soo soo bad. I have been sick for like, three or four days now, I really feel terrible. My insides just hurt and every time I stand up I get dizzy. This computer is slightly difficult for me to type on. Oh well I only have 13 minutes left if I did my math correctly which, knowing my intellectual level, I probably did not do. I kind of feel bad that these people I don't even personally know already hate me and my suite mates. That's kind of depressing you know, but then hey, what can you do about it?  Everyone is entitled to pass their own judgements, how ever unfortunately. I wish my computer was working. It's really, really cute. It's a new black compaqe-compaque well however you spell it that's what it is. I wonder how I did on my French test two days ago. I hope that I did okay. I am seeing all kinds of new people. Isn't it surprising all the people that you see all the time, every day that you dont know and will never meet?  I think that that is , well to say the least, strange. MY back really hurts. I think , wow, coughing fit, that I will thank the girl who's computer this is profusely. I feel so bad now, physically and mentally. I cant wait to go home this weekend. Have my mom take care of me and see my guy that I am kind of dating. I miss him. he says he misses me. I wonder if he is sincere in the way that he expresses himself he is so poetic and thoughtful and lovely. I said that I loved him but I dont know if I really meant it. I dont know if I could ever really love anyone. After all, I really dont even think that I love myself. chocolate milk, how random, sounds totally really really good right now. Anyway, he has a boxer dog named Romeo. Very cute. I hate most dogs however. I love my cats. I miss my cats. I am glad I am getting at least this first assignment done. I cant spell for shit tonight. I also manage to talk like a sailor. Oh well. I feel bad, this girl has like left her room, probably until I leave, I guess I wouldn't want to hang out with a strange blonde girl typing on my computer either. I wonder if she is talking about me now or will talk about me when I leave. That must suck, to know that that is going to happen and well, I guess I'll just be as nice as I can be. I really dont want her to hate me but oh well. Oh hello boy in very very short shorts. That is so Montreal. I am just in extreme pain. I want to work out and I haven't in like ohhh-three weeks now. Hello freshman 15, 25, 55. Im all about gaining weight this year. My mom is going to freak out and enroll me in every diet program in the country. Maybe I just can start like, slim fast right now, save myself some time and pain with my mere. I want to go to France. I wonder what exactly constitutes 20 minutes. I really must be very very thankful. I am such a terrible person. I really really am mean. "
Tell me about yourself.,"This assignment was not as hard to figure out as I thought it was going to be. Actually it was quite easy. All I had to do was follow the simple directions. It is pretty cool in here. This library is not quiet though. I thought libraries are for people trying to read or study, but this one has lots of little rug rats talking and laughing. Oh well. Next weekend is going to be a lot of fun. I get to go see my boyfriend, who lives in Lubbock. I can't wait. Boy, I miss him a lot. I wonder how much my phone bill is going to be from calling him almost everyday. These two guys sitting by me are talking about weird things. I don't think they can figure out their computer. What do I want to buy today, when I go shopping?  I'm not quite sure. Maybe I will get a new dress. I really need to start looking for a homecoming dress. I have to have it by October because that is when Texas Tech's homecoming is. Hopefully my parents will pay for it. How do I tell them though, that on the way to San Antonio I got a speeding ticket. I guess I will just tell them that I was so anxious to see them that my anxiety caused me to speed. The police officer was not very understanding though, although I was at fault and I am going to pay the consequences. I need to study all day today, but Im not really looking forward to it. If I get behind in my school work though, it will be extremely hard to catch back up, and I don't want to have to do that. Maybe I will go out tonight and have a really fun time dancing and stuff. That ought to compensate for me studying all day, and release the stress. At least I will have something to look forward to tonight. For now I only have studying to look forward to. Who do I want to go out with?  Maybe I will call up Jessica. She's pretty fun to hang out with, or maybe I will go to a club with my brother and his friends along with mine. No, I did that last night. It was fun though, maybe I should do that again tonight. Whatever the case, I need to have a night of fun planned so that tomorrow I can study all day again. I wonder what my roommates are doing. I bet they are watching TV  That's all they ever do. It must get boring for them, but evidently they like it. I can't do that, because I get overly-bored. They are the type of people that don't like to do anything outside of the house. I can't believe I got messed up with them. If I only knew that they were like that, I would have never agreed to live with them. They are kind of psycho. I don't know how anyone can fight and be unhappy as much as they are. I try to stay away from there, but maybe I need to find new places to go. My brother is probably half way to Wisconsin right now. I hope he is doing well. At least I got to see him before he left. That girl has a tattoo on her ankle in the shape of a snake. That is so ugly. I would never get a tattoo like that. I think it is so unattractive to guys. That lies right above the piercing on the face. I don't really think too bad of piercing your belly button, but anything else is too far. Actually, I have even thought about getting mine pierced, but Im not quite sure if I want to go through all of that pain. Wow, that lady has a huge afro. Doesn't she know that it looks really bad. I guess if she thinks it looks good though, then that is all that matters.     "
Tell me about yourself.,"My name is Rebecca Webber. I wonder how many people will start out this writing by stating their name. it seems the logical thing to do since they have just finished typing it and therefore will be thinking about it. I wonder if this assignment is some kind of study that our professor is doing. he did say that he and whoever helps him would not get around to reading these writings for a long time which makes me think that he is compiling some big database to look at find stuff out about people who take a beginning psychology course at the University of Texas and what makes them tick. I wonder how many people will write about how they think that this is a dumb assignment. how come my words are appearing on the screen on one huge line instead of returning to the next line?  I would really like to have access to these writings. I bet it will fascinating to see what people will put down. can any of this be used against me in a court of law?   I am having a great deal of trouble making my computer operate correctly. that is why I am writing this assignment in the basement of jester instead of in the comfort of my own room on the 11th floor. I am worried about having to run down that many steps if there is a fire. the thought of burning to death does not scare me as much as the thought of drowning. that is odd since I am an excellent swimmer and even have worked as a lifeguard. the summer I guarded, I had nightmares about drowning. I don't want to think/write about that anymore. I wonder if Luke write his article for the Texan. I wonder if Daniel is mad about the letter I wrote him. relationships are very hard sometimes. I have two hard relationships. one with Daniel and one with Abby. gabe is hard to relate at times too. I like Abby more now that I don't have to live with her. I wish that I could just be normal where Daniel is concerned. actually that is the problem: I am normal. I am tired of this. I swam laps today. exercise is very good for self-esteem, not because it makes you look better although it does)it just makes you feel better about yourself. I wonder if there is a hormone released when you work hard at something that makes you feel good about yourself. this seems like such a waste of time. I glad to help professor pennebaker get tenure though.  "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am reading a book called Atlas Shrugged and it is affecting my consciousness and belief system more significantly than any novel I've ever read. Ayn Rand wrote it and it's just a metaphorical portrayal of her philosophy of Objectivism, but the book touches on subjects that I feel are very important to all humans. I find myself newly enraged at those incompetent people of the world. Not because they are incompetent but because they are the ones who ask for help and breaks and favors by those people who built the society in which we live. The anti monopoly law is a perfect example of this. Why should the men who built the country be penalized just to give the other people who weren't strong, smart, or productive enough a ""fair"" chance. It really is disgusting. Just as is, in the theatre department they don't allow one person to get too many leads in order to give other people a chance. THIS IS STUPID. If those others who would never otherwise get a chance can't cut it, then they don't deserve a chance to begin with do they?  I also notice the moral depravity of some of my friends. These are the ones who are joining fraternities in order to get breaks when they go into the real world. Personally I would hate knowing that I found my station in life by the grace of one of my old drinking buddies. I would much rather know that my hard work, intelligence and talent got me to where I was. But not many people think like this anymore. I guess that I just have way too much faith in my abilities, but I'm glad I do. Ayn Rand is right in saying that incompetency should not be rewarded in society, but it is. So in the book, all of these genius men, who have built of the industrial world are becoming much too regulated, to the point of ridicule, so one guy called John Galt decides that all of the producers should go on strike against the looters. He decides to stop the motor of the world - hence, Atlas Shrugged. So one by one, men who own oil companies and car, and coal, etc. starts disappearing and the world fall apart. It is such a great argument too. You should never take advantage of the hand that feeds you, especially if you haven't the abilities to perform their task as well as they have. This is not, however, indicative of a condoning of ruthless, unfair capitalism. The men who build the world in this book form a secret Utopia and their motto is that they will never give to any man anything, nor will they take more than is their due. Thus, charging unfair prices etc. is just as bad as giving breaks to the dumbasses. Anyway, I have this friend called Jason and since this is for psychology, hopefully someone will read this and can tell me what his problem is. Actually he's not my friend anymore because I don't want such an asshole for a friend. He's the only person I've ever met in my life that truly believes that he's better than everyone around him. You hear of people speaking of someone like this but they are never quite as serious about it as I am. He thinks that he's found the only way to living, and it's so wrong it's sad. The only thing by which he measures success is economic gain. I have heard say horrible things about all of his ""friends"" and have heard what he's said about me behind my back. I've overheard him saying that he's set  in life because when his dad dies he's going to get 500000. This wouldn't be so bad if his parents abused him or something but they are the nicest people in the world and give him everything he wants. Of course, this is probably the root of his problem. I've noticed that he doesn't go to parties unless he's throwing them. If he actually does go to one, afterward he makes it a point to call out all of the things that in his eyes were bad about it. He doesn't want to hang out with these people because they are irresponsible and are potheads, while he smokes just a much pot as they do. And, they pay rent and go to school all on their on while he does nothing but loot off of his parents. He really has sever problems. I guess you'd just have to know him to know exactly what I mean, the biggest asshole ever. Anyway, uhmmmmmm, I went back home this weekend to get my car and I got to see my dog. I missed her more than I missed my parents. Shes so pretty. She's a golden lab retriever and she sleeps in my bed with me every night, Just as she has since she was a puppy. the other day my mom almost got her run over by letting her go to the bathroom without the leash, she ran out in front of a car and they had to swerve up into our yard to miss her. Pretty scary. but she was ok thank god, just really scared. She had her tail between her legs all night long. My roommate is really cool and nice thank god. you never know what kind of freak you're going to get when you go pot luck, thank goodness he's not a freak. He's listens to a different kind of music than I do, but that's cool, because I'm learning a new genre. anyway, my 20 minutes are up so bye bye. "
Tell me about yourself.,It took me forever to get into this program I had the address written all down wrong and now I am going to be late for practice Shannon is waiting for me and she is not going to be happy I can't believe I have a flat tire everyone was honking at me to tell me on MLK. oh well so I had to walk here and now I am running completely behind schedule I am gonna get Kevin to fix my tire tonight when he gets off work I hope he knows how to change a flat and where to take it because I have no idea he won't mind he is really a cool guy what am I gonna do until then I guess Ill just walk back home to it is good exercise for me any way now I am so sidetracked I dont know what to write my parents are coming Friday so now I have to clean for them and that I have absolutely no time for but I guess I'll have to find it gosh my typing is terrible and I keep hitting the wrong letters since I haven't typed all summer. this computer thing is not for me I am so computer illiterate but I am very open to learning if someone would teach me I don't want to go to work on Friday I really dont like it there anymore I probably should quit then I would have no money whatsoever that it'll be nice maybe I will starve and lose some weight I really didn't me that I could never starve myself I love food too much my gosh Shannon is going to be pretty mad since I was suppose to be at practice ten minutes ago to teach her what we learned now she is just going to be waiting on  me because I am gonna have to walk down there and it will take forever. my car hasn't had a flat in such a long time I wonder what I hit because I didn't see anything in the tire but what do I know. my mind is just going blank nothing can run through it cause Im so tired. I want my shoes back from winstons house they have been there for a week now and they are my favorites but I can't remember exactly how to get there I would probably get lost I can't wait for this weekend the game will be so much fun and I won't be so nervous for it this time I wonder how many people will be there for UCLA how exciting I am so glad I talked to my friend Michael last night he sounds like he is having so much fun in California at occidental I can't wait to visit him he says his classes are pretty tough I would probably drop out! just picking it wouldn't hurt to get a good kick in the butt to get myself in gear. gosh twenty minutes seems like forever to put down all your thoughts I don't even remember what I have attempted to type so far I think my time is almost up though and then I can run to bellmont to help Shannon who has no clue where I am I was suppose to call my friend Whitney last night to see how rush went at her school and I didn't I am a little curious to see what she picked I cant believe she hasn't called to tell me because I am her best friend but I guess I can forgive and forget but hopefully she'll call me tonight last night I talked to rhiannon and she sounded so upset I hope things will get better for her I am so tired I am falling asleep good thing my time is just about up because I am exhausted naturally I cant go take a nap because I have practice I guess its all worth it in the end because I get to perform for a lot of people but sometimes it seems like a waist because no one bothers to tell the new girls what is going on and then we look like idiots I want so much to say something but so far I have kept my mouth shut and just had my own kind of fun I dont know if they act this way on purpose or they just don't know exactly what they are doing I try my hardest and ever since I hurt my knee it has sucked tremendously I can't strut my usual stuff and I just want to scream because no one knows how much it hurts well it has been well over 20 minutes now so I am going to practice bye! 
Tell me about yourself.,"ok, I guess I really don't know where to start. I just got out of my BA101 class, which was possibly the single most boring experience thus so far since classes began. I guess maybe I should have stayed longer, but there were so many freshman around me with their eyes so wide open, and trying to make friends with everyone around them, that I couldn't stand it for very much longer. this screen is really bothering me because it seems as though Im writing all of this on one very long  line, I'm wondering if there is some way I can go about fixing it after this is all over, because it is really annoying and it seems as though I'm not writing anything. I don't know what I'm going to do tonight, it's too late to call my boyfriend, he lives overseas, and there is a seven hour time change. I hope everything is going well with him, because he is going into his obligatory military service soon and he is really nervous about it. If only I was still in France that way I would know that everything was going well with him. this is a really huge box that I'm writing in because the wrap around just came into affect. very strange, very very strange. I guess I'm at a point where I don't exactly know what to write about because my mind is kind of going blank. My friend once told me that he never stops thinking, that at all times he is thinking about something, and when you are talking to him, that he may or may not be thinking about the subject that you are talking about with him. that worries me, because sometimes I see Im smile for no apparent reason when we are talking, and I just know that the last thirty words that I have just said, he is paying absolutely no attention to. my friends are kind of strange in that they are all in their own little worlds, that's not saying that I'm not. But my little world seems a little bit more down to earth then the ones that my friends are living in. Maybe that's why I'm taking psych instead of sociology, it's because Im trying to figure out who these people are and why I chose them as my friends. It could be an extension off this whole existential kick hat I've recently gotten into. My boyfriend is really into existentialism, and so the only thing I've been reading as of late has been Kundera and Sartre. But then of course I must be honest, I'm taking this course because it is located close to my other class on Tuesday Thursday, and it is at a convenient time relative to that class as well. Not to mention my friends who have taken soc, told me it was echelons more boring than this class was to take. I  hope I get a good grade in this class, after this last semester, my grades are suffering, I literally dropped my GPA by . 4 over this last summer semester, which should indicate that I really didn't do very well. But I only have 35 hours, so if I do well this semester, I can bring my GPA back up over 3. 5 and maybe my parents will start being nice to me again. It's not like they aren't nice now, but they are ""really disappointed how I handled last semester""  that is ""considering that we sent you to France last you, you could at least try a little harder""  this would all be said in the James Earl Jones low god-like voice that I always get in my head whenever my Dad is yelling at me. I probably get that in my head, because my Dad yelling at me reminds me of Darth Vader when he's mad at the corporals, and James Earl Jones is the voice of Darth Vader, do you see the connection?  Anyway, so I'm trying to make my grades appear somewhat better, because if I do, they  will probably let me go on the intensive French study program I want to go to next summer. and then I can see my boyfriend he is so cute. I miss him a lot. I tend to think about him most when I'm either lonely or bored in class. That only either maker me more distracted from the work I should be doing, or even sadder about being all alone. If only he could be American, my life would be so much simpler. Have I been writing for twenty minutes yet, I swear I've been writing for decades, and my hands are starting to get lazy, and tired, and I really don't want all these people around me in the computer room, and I wish that I had had the time to take a shower this morning, because I think all day in the sun has really made me start to smell. I have to have been writing for over twenty minutes now, because the people at the workstations around me have already started leaving, granted they were here before I even started this little assignment, into the mind of the student at the University of Texas. I'm starting to think I'm going to end this pretty soon, because that is the only thing I can think of right now, is when am I going to end this assignment. I think this would probably be a good time because this is starting to redundant. But you said that it didn't matter what we said as long a s we did the assignment and wrote for twenty minutes. so here I am my twenty minutes complete, and I am saying good bye and thank god this is over. only one more to go.   "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, here it goes. I don't know exactly what to write about because my mind  is sort of blank to real thoughts as I've been studying all day. But I'll start with what is the most important thing to me right now--loneliness. What better thing to write about when you're listening to Bruce Springsteen. Anyway, it's not the clinical loneliness from which I suffer. It's more of a deprivation I guess. It's a deprivation of emotional intimacy. You see, I have quite a few male friends  which is great because male bonding is always a must. But I'm the type of guy  who always needs a deep relationship with a girl. It gives me a sort of basis in my life. Everything falls into place. I do better academically if I'm in love with a girl and I  am more confident about everything I do. I am so much happier when I'm in love. Basically, when comes down to it, I love being in love. How do I know?  Well, I've been there before. I fell deeply in love with a girl in my junior year of high school. Yeah, yeah, I know ""you were too young to know what love was. ""  I really wasn't. There's a Van Halen song which says           ""How do I know when it's love?          I can't tell ya' but it lasts forever.        How does it feel when it's love?          It's just something you feel together. '  Well, I completely relate to the togetherness part and lately I've come to realize  that I can also relate to the foreverness part, too. There will always be a place in my heart for Shannon. But she isn't the point. She is what was. And life isn't what was, it's what's going to be. All I'm saying is that I know what love is and how to love. I want it back . But it's so hard up here at UT to find it, or so it seems. I should be able to find it because I'm pretty good-looking and I've really turned into a nice person. But every girl that catches my seems so unapproachable. But, there's another factor in this whole game. I'm already in love. I'm in love with someone who  lives back in The Woodlands. I had a crush on this girl since my sophomore year and somehow we developed a friendship where both of us went through some peculiar twists. You see, we know we both liked each other and we both wanted to do something about it but we didn't. I didn't because I felt that if I told how I really felt, she  wouldn't understand and run away from me(metaphorically). She didn't do it because  I don't think she knew what she was feeling. She's never been there before so she's not familiar with the symptoms. It took me a while to figure mine out with Shannon, but when it happened, I knew the second it hit me. I think it's hit her but  she doesn't know what to do. Well, my twenty minutes is up so I'm gonna' cruise. But I might actually get on here on  do this out of pure enjoyment. You see, I always do this. I always sit down and throw up all this junk onto paper and then sift through the vomit afterwards. It helps when you're stressed. Anyway, thanks for listening, and if no one ever reads this  I DO THINK BERT FROM SESAME STREET IS EVIL. IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE, GET ON THE NET AND FIND THE BERT IS EVIL WEBSITE AND SEE FOR YOURSELF!!!!!!!!!        "
Tell me about yourself.,"  I am feeling a little hungry right now. What should I do? Go to Jester, go out to eat, make something here in the dorm. Maybe I should just go to the Union. Lets see, I will change clothes and go shower or something. I'll get my comb and toothbrush and go to the restroom. What do I wear to go out tonight?  I think I will wear my white Polo shirt and my black shorts. No I'll wear my khaki shorts and my white tennis shoes. I can't stay out to long since I have so much homework to do. The entire English rough draft to do, my pre-calculus, and all my psychology reading to do. Man, I feel sleepy, guess I should have gone to bed early last night instead of watching Letterman and Leno. Maybe I'll just come back and sleep after my biology class tomorrow. I wonder what is on T. V. right now. It's mostly just the news. Good! Entertainment Tonight is on now. Hope it's a good show. Let me start washing up and changing my clothes for supper. I don't think it will rain again so I guess I don't need my umbrella tonight. I wonder how much I will have to do tomorrow. I still need to go draw my tickets for the Longhorn game on Saturday. I hope the seats are better than last time. "
Tell me about yourself.,"class lasted all day today. on Tuesdays and Thursdays I have class from 8-5, 8 is to early 5 is to late. I like earlier classes its easy to concentrate in the mornings. I worked out today  I think I hurt my elbow there is alot of pain in the  joint. I have been lifting weights for a long time maybe that has something to do with it. lost 7 pounds today, I now way 310 lbs. my mother thinks I grew another inch I dont know maybe. this typing is really bothering my elbow, damm thing really  hurts. I think I am going to take some aspirin. I've got a biology test in two weeks, lots of studying to do. first test should not be so bad just a review of chemistry. the class moves pretty fast but the  professor is pretty good. the seats in that class are way to close together. I am about 6-5 maybe a little more and my knees push right up against the backs of the chairs. it makes it hard to concentrate after about 20 min. all my other classes the chairs are pretty comfortable. I hope we beat UCLA on sat. I hope the d defense can hold Jimmy Hicks under 200 yards. James Brown might not play, but Watson is a good back up. Ricky will have a great day and will kick ass. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm very tired and don't want to take a shower I'll never be able to go to sleep  I wonder what mom and dad are doing supposed to call but roommate is on the phone I can't wait until this weekend to see Eric hope everything goes well and works out I really like him Anthony has always been there but I am changing and not happy anymore doesn't seem right not like it used to be I know he will always be special but I'm not sure I'm happy with him anymore  I hope Robin doesn't get lost waiting for me after class she probably will because she gets nervous being by herself I have so many math problems to work out and I don't even want to think about them. I cannot forget to bring my notes from last year from home, they will probably help me a great deal I can understand my notes a lot better My feet are so cold I have to put socks on before I go to bed I wonder how Adrean is doing my roommate took her some pizza that's really nice  I would be mad too, I hope everything works out she's very upset talking to her mom. Nothing is on TV it's hard to believe it's so late already time flies so fast there's not enough time to get everything done shouldn't have stayed so long at the RSC it was nice though and I had a good time glad I went  wonder if Anthony will call back so hard to let go of someone who seems like such a part of you I don't know if it's the right thing but if I wait too long I could miss my opportunity with Eric being friends is too hard because of everything we've been through old feelings are still there and get in the way of being friends I feel bad to do that to him sort of unexpectedly but I can't pretend to be happy with him anymore wonder what will happen we always seem to get back together eventually but this time seems different I can't forget to get my dirty clothes and the clothes I need to wear this weekend at home it is such a pain taking things back and forth  Wonder if Anthony will call Eric is working and won't get off until late have to get up so early and have to have everything together I still have so much to do but I'm too tired maybe I'll do it in the morning but then I can sleep later if I do it now I'll just do it before I go to sleep. "
Tell me about yourself.,"  I am sitting here in front of the computer trying to write a constant flow  of my thoughts its about 1:30 in the morning the day of the first UT football  game that was successfully won by the Horns my roommate is sleeping right now  it seem that he sleeps almost 14 hours a day it makes me mad that for some  reason that it seems to me that he wastes time so much. All he does every day  is go to class, which I guess I should give him credit for that, and when  class is over all he does is sit in front of the computer and download things  or he lays in bed and watches TV or movies all day he is not that social  either he isn't part of a fraternity or any other group or doesn't play any  intramurals. He doesn't study whatsoever I guess I am just worried about  him because I care about him I mean we've been friends since the sixth grade. It seems kind of weird when we were in junior high he was the sociable type  and I was the reclusive type and about since the 10th grade the situation has  taken a 180 degree turn I hope they televise the 49er game that they are  playing against the Rams and even though most everyone especially my roommate  thinks that the 49er don't have a prayer I believe that this opportunity will  be a coming out party for JJ Stokes and the emergence of Jim Drunkenmiller the  last rookie quarterback to start for the Niners was Joe Montana hopefully a  good sign I am also kind of disappointed that I am not able to join the  professional business fraternities because they hold most of there meetings  when I have my CH301 extension course from 6 to7:30 PM but hey looking at the  positive side I have something extra to look forward to next year it sure is  great to be alive I feel like I am on top of the world everything is working  like clockwork I feel like watching Disney movies well it's about 2 o'clock  so I guess that I should go to sleep to rest for the world that lays upon me  tomorrow and remember to smile after all physical motion controls the mental emotion ( - :      "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am writing in the Flawn Library. This is my first time using the computers here at the University. I was a little afraid because I did not have my e-mail address yet. But now I do and I am feeling a little better. I still do not know how to e-mail someone yet, but hopefully I will learn. The only people I would e-mail to would be my dad or some assignment I have to do for RTF 305. I am not very good with computers. That is one of my weaknesses. I feel a little out of place here in the computer room because I feel that I am the only person that does not know how to use computers. I guess I will keep asking questions until I finally figure it out. I wish I learned how to use computers earlier in my life, then maybe I would not be at such a disadvantage. Computers could come in real handy. Like for this writing assignment, for instance. In RTF 305, we have to go to the web page and ask questions in a discussion between fellow students. That sounds like a good idea. I am feeling tired today. I got enough sleep last night. I do know what my problem is. It was hard staying awake in  class today. Hopefully  tomorrow will be different. Before I came to the library, I was supposed to go to a SI for RTF. The only problem was that I went to the CMA building instead of the CBA building. That upset me because I was really looking forward to going. There is one tomorrow, but I have Psy during that time. However, I will be going to the Psy SI today from 4-5 p. m. This time, I know where the building is. I think these SI classes are good ideas because it is a follow up to the lecture that students receive in class. So, if I missed something, I could go to the SI and re-learn what I did not understand. Now, there is no excuses for not understanding material. I did an assignment like this one in my typing class last year. It was the same exact prompt:  let your mind flow freely onto the screen. That assignment was only for five minutes though. Right now in the library, there is a long line for the computers. I hate waiting in lines. Today I waited in line to draw football tickets to the UT vs. Rutgers game on Saturday. I hope UT wins the football game. I am a big fan of football. In high school I was in band. That means that I got a free ticket to go to every football game. However, our football team was not that good. I think that Psychology will be an interesting class. I like learning about people and the things they do. I am looking forward to an interesting semester. I hope that the class is not too hard. Some questions that come to my mind right now is why do students have to do this writing assignment?  What kind of research is this?  What will this writing assignment tell about students?  I will also be doing the experiments instead of the research paper.  "
Tell me about yourself.,"I absolutely hate Mondays they make everything seem to last forever, except for the weekend. minutes seem longer, hours seem longer, the entire day drags without any hope for it to end. But in actuality, if Mondays were obliterated from the week, Tuesdays would simply inherit the mundane tasks of being the first day of the week and the thief of the weekend. weekends are not exactly the most practical approach to leisure activity. the ""fun"" things in life we wait to do until the weekend and try to cram everything into the two days that can not possibly be accomplished only to start out the new week  on a Monday nonetheless  with drained energy, hangovers, for some, and incredibly lethargic. a better approach would be to evenly space the week out with ""leisure days"" in between week days. also by random people taking off different leisure days, the maximum enjoyment could be appreciated due to less crowding, fewer lines, less traffic, etc. traffic is far too overrated. the idea of everyone trying to get one place at one time is beyond me . if every one had their own schedules, for instance of everyone could decide for themselves, when their necessary lunch time was instead of the standard 12:00, the roads and restaurants at that time would probably be less crowded, therefore, traffic would decrease. if traffic were lessened everyone would probably be less cranky and agitated. cranky people are just entirely too obnoxious and loud. simply because of their crankiness is everyone else cranky. its like a yawn  once someone else begins to complain about things, you find yourself griping about little nit picky things over which you have no control  perky people are the same way only usually they are responsible for the cranky people being cranky. I guess it all goes  to say that there is such a thing as too much of anything. you can be too cranky and you can be too perky    "
Tell me about yourself.,"okay Im writing this stream of consciousness things and it's 11:57 and god my roommate is sick as hell she's got this nasty head cold and I hope my typing isn't keeping her up god I wish people wouldn't pound their feet when they go up and down the stairs I wonder if my computer was a bad idea when I decided to place it right by the window oh god I think I am bothering my roommate she just sat up but now she's laying back down again I wonder if Ill get cold tonight with the fan on cause a cold fronts coming through I feel a little drainage in my throat I hope Im not catching my roommates cold oh god I hope tomorrow wont be boring or mundane god it's only 12:00 I never realized how hard it is to write for 20 minutes this mouse pointer is annoying me I want to move it but I dont want to stop writing thud somebody's making thud noises outside god that fan is loud oh I can't stop writing because if I did it would be unethical or shit my roommate just made a very weird snorting sound it must suck to have a nasty head cold your first week of school Im looking at my water bottle wishing we had an ozarka bottle in our dorm I was mildly planning on drawing up a petition with the other girls in order to get one I was also toying with the idea of creating a petition to get better food in the cafeteria or whatever god I can't wait to use the sorority koozie I got on bid day for some reason I don't like flashing around and advertising the fact that Im in a sorority, not that Im not proud of my sorority it's just that it seems such a confining statement to be making to the rest of the world who reads my T-shirt I mean Im no longer Lindsey (blank) but I am sorority girl and so many connotations accompany such a title so Id rather start a point 0 with people instead of increasing their preconceived notions of my personality because of my tee shirt god it's only 12:07 boy Ive never written so much bullshit in my life there goes my roomie again with her congested self I wonder if Ill be able to swing this college life I mean I want to do well so well so I can prove it to my mom that I can do it yet I want to party a lot I know that sounds real deep and profound anyway my back is starting to ache because I still havent attached the back part to my computer chair b/c this task requires me to use some tool that I don't have in my possession at the moment so my computer chair kind of acts a rolling piano stool type dealie, speaking of computers I put this damn computer desk together with my own bare hands and boy am I proud it arrived in 4 foot 3 inch thick box of plywood and screws and it now stands a proud computer desk with a cd holding section, god my eyes are starting to get tired but I really have no reason to go to bed b/c I have no classes before 12 and Im not a morning person and I already have a hard enough time filling my days with things to do and I don't want to be too tired to party because Ive risen before 10:00 am. so I have many incentives to not go to bed and I feel like shit if I get more than 8 hours of sleep Im one of those always got to be busy people so I can't stand not having something to occupy my time even if it is sleeping late in the morning yet I feel like a slug if I sleep to late actually I feel guilty as if Im wasting my life and not prioritizing my time correctly god my left eye is tired and my nose keeps itching, Im so proud of myself that I am completing this assignment ahead of schedule at least it appears that Im off to a good start see I just can't fathom how some girls I know are already missing class, I mean what the hell else do you have to do here but occasionally study, party, and sleep so my belief is you might as well go to class since your paying for it and it makes a tremendous difference in your grade, but I shouldn't necessarily jump on a soap box because I never know how long I will remain this disciplined. kick ass it's 12:18 and Im signing off! "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am sitting here in the computer lab of my dorm at SRD, even though I  have a computer in my room. I have been too lazy to go buy a network card in order to get the internet on my computer. I have absolutely no idea how to use the internet. In fact, some girl at my dorm had to show me how to get onto this website. Hopefully, I will be able to learn how to use it pretty soon, especially for this class. I don't think I'm going to do very well in this class because I don't know anything about psychology. If my study habits don't improve, then I might not do very well in any of my classes. My math class is kicking my butt!!!!  I have tried so hard to do my homework, but I don't know how to do a lot of it. I have a test on Friday and I know I'm not going to do very well at all. I need to do good on this test since it is the first one in the class. I don't know what to expect on college tests because I never really had to study in high school. I just got off the phone with my best friend from home; she is a year younger than me. I miss her so much. She is the one person that I can talk to for hours about nothing. I was supposed to go home in two weeks to see her, I can't. She was upset when I told her. I promised her that I would be home to see her in three weeks though. My sorority is Delta Gamma, and it is so much fun. I have so much going on in the next two weeks with my sorority, which is why I can't go home to see my best friend. All the girls are so sweet and I know I'm going to like it a lot. I am very excited about being in Austin because in Mt. Pleasant, there is nothing to do ever. We get excited about going to a nice restaurant to eat. My home town is  pretty small; it only has about 13,000 people. Everybody in the whole town knows whenever something happens. The high school football games are the entertainment for Friday nights. I guess there are some good points about living in Mt. Pleasant though. I have some of the best friends I've ever had from my home town. Also,  I get excited about little things that girls from big cities don't get excited about. My classes have more people in them than all of my graduating class. I am amazed that there are so many people at this college!  I didn't really get lost on the first day, mainly because I looked at my map for two days. I am about to go work out because I don't want to gain the freshman fifteen like everyone says I will. I  don't have room on my body to gain any more weight!!!!  I don't really watch what I eat though. I do some exercises and I walk a million miles to class everyday. How do people gain weight here whenever classes are a  million miles apart?  I am so tired because it is late at night, but I wanted to get one assignment over with early. My twenty minutes is almost up. I have so much to do tomorrow; I have class from 11 to 5. I am dreading it. Then I have a meeting at 6:00 and I have to study for math. I am going to sixth street tomorrow night if I get through studying in time. Well, my time is finally up and I am so proud of myself for getting this done on time because I usually procrastinate.                                           "
Tell me about yourself.,"today I called up some of my friends from Harlingen (where Im from) and we all went out to the drag. it was sooooo nice to be able to kill time, since it has been going by so slowly. I am so tired from walking all day. at least I found my exploring psychology book at bevos. I want to get fake nails put on tomorrow. my mom said that I could buy whatever I wanted, but I feel bad spending the money. oh well, at least Im not doing anything illegal. I am so excited about rushing for that Christian sorority. I really want to make some lifelong friends here. not just some people who only care about themselves and what they're going to wear tomorrow. I wonder if it's true that a huge majority of psychology majors become shoe salesmen. great. Im here getting homesick for nothing. Im surprised that there are so many people talking outloud here at this computer lab. I thought I would be the loudest one here by simply opening my backpack. I wonder if it matters that Im not using capital letters when I type. Im sure it will be fine. I am so thirsty. since I've been here I have already finished off 18 bottles of water. at least it's helping to keep my skin clear (knock on wood). psychology is so interesting. I wonder what my stream of consciousness says about me. who knows, Im probably sending off signals meaning that Im going to be a psychotic weirdo when I get older. I like my necklace, but I feel like I am wearing a dog collar. it looks so tight on me; I have a huge neck to begin with. they say that the first sign of aging on a woman is when her neck wrinkles. well my neck has quite a few. I really like this computer. my keyboard is so annoying. this one has keys that write so smoothly. I hope I've been studying enough. I really need to get over the idea that college is extremely hard and requires absurd amounts of studying. Im doing just fine!  Im really surprised that I have so much to say. I thought I would be sitting here trying to impress whoever's going to read this by using really big words and coming up with impressive thoughts. I guess I was really wrong. I forgot my glasses in my dorm. I hope Im not damaging my eyes by not wearing them. these girls sitting beside me are really getting loud. it's really getting annoying. all of a sudden they quieted down. I guess Im sending off bad signals to them. I really feel like brushing my teeth. for some reason I've been brushing them an average of five times a day. it's probably some type of stress release or something. I wonder how my friend Jody is doing back home. she just left to Harlingen this morning. I wish I could have gone home with her but I really need to duke it out here. I can do it!!  what am I going to do tonight?  probably study or something. I hope my roommate decides to stay in our room for once. I guess I like my space though. my mind just went blank right now and I dont have anything to say. I really admire the older people who come to college. I wish my mom would. she deserves it. I hope I am that devoted to my child. I dont see how someone could give up so much for someone. I know I would do it for her, but just the fact that she has done so much for me already is amazing. I wonder if animals go to heaven when they die. I really think they do. it wouldnt be fair to me if they didnt. I wonder how Danny is doing back home. I hope he is having a fun time. Im so lucky to be here. I wish I could give back to someone else. maybe that volunteer organization will call me and ask if I want to help out. I definitely would jump at the chance. I need to go to the rec center and pick up an aerobics membership. I hope Im not gaining weight here, but I guess I will find out when Jody brings my scale back up with her. I better not be gaining weight, because I spent an enormous amount of money on a personal trainer. what a waste!  I hate it when people ask me what type of music I listen to. I really dont know what to say because I dont listen to very much music. Im so glad Im getting this assignment over with now so that I dont have to rush to do it at the last minute. I need to go back to Mezes to sign up for some of those experiments. I hope there are some slots I can fill up. Ill bet that so many people are going to end up writing a research paper just because they'll put of going to sign up for the experiments or because they dont show up to participate. what a waste!  maybe I shouldn't talk, because I can just see that happening to me now. I wish I was good at math. that would be the ultimate!  I've been typing for twenty minutes now, so I think Ill sign off. Im surprisingly sleepy!  you all probably wont read this until a few months from now, but I just want to say thanks for such a wonderfully convenient assignment :) I hope Im not too weird :)))) "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, here goes. I'm in my room right now and it's very warm. My housing  is not air conditioned. I'm not used to doing homework like this so you'll have to bear with me. I tried to do this assignment about a week ago. after some fifteen minutes I was kicked off. I was beyond pissed. My  ankle is itching. Yesterday we went to mar's and we waited outside and I sat in the grass. For some reason that makes my leg itch. I wind is  blowing in my room and it feels good. I am very tired and want to go back to sleep. I took an hour nap awhile ago. Matt came down. I hear people talking in the alley. One of them is a guy. I wish Matt could stay here with me in Austin. I miss him so much. I'm so pathetic. The tissue on  my computer is waving like a flag, so are the papers on my bulletin board. I need to call my tutors one day. I need one in math more than anything  else. I'm not stupid or anything, I just need assistance on the problems sometimes. Doug say's that I don't have a life. That I has no personality. That made my confidence soar. I know I didn't have a life, but I really couldn't help it. My parents are super, super strict and I wasn't allowed to do normal teenager stuff. Even now that I can Im restricted to because of my boyfriend Matt. He cam down tonight. I love him so much. He should be calling in about an hour to say that he got home safe and sound. He's mad at Doug because Doug wouldn't leave us alone today. I was kind of mad too. Doug doesn't like the thought of me and Matt spending time  together. He's weird like that. Matt should be nicer to his parents. They both have the mind set on he acts like a butt so I will too. Matt is very stubborn but his parents are not very nice. At least I had a close family. Matt doesn't even think that his parents love him. I know they do but he  doesn't think that they do. He still sees himself and their mistake. I  don't know what to tell him to believe otherwise. I'm going back home on  October 4th. Matt's birthday is on that weekend. Saturday will be a lot  of fun. After that Ill be going to the renaissance festival  with Matt and Doug. We're going to camp down there. It'll be a lot of fun. Doug  can be a lot of fun if he's not in his pouty mood. Maybe he'll find  himself a girlfriend by then. Then he'll be happy. I think. He didn't  seem to mind our relationship when he was dating. he was too into Amanda. I didn't like her and knew she was going to hurt him but as usual no one  listened to me. I like my room it's nice. I live at the women's co-ops. They are cool. All the girls in the house have made me feel completely  welcome. I've been typing for about ten minutes. I think that's pretty  good. If yall read this yall will have a lot to read. I'm trying to  type slow so this won't get too long. I'm typing about half of my normal typing speed. Doug liked Elyssa. He'd like to have her legs wrapped  around him. He is very crass. Then again Matt can be that way too. He is rarely rude to me though. I'm am usually respected and taken care of by my guys. I'm used to being protected. It's weird being down here knowing that I can actually be hurt. That is scary. My guys live two and a half hours away. We won the football game today. The tower is lit up. I love UT. I love the freedom I acquired when I came down here. It's not that  Im partying and getting drunk and toasted all the time. I just like that fact that I can if I want too. I don't have to beg to be let out of the house or anything. I've even been studying more down here than I did at home. I've kept up with all of my classes so far. I'll be doing some  of my homework tomorrow. I read the assigned readings in between classes. The written assignments that actually take time get done at home. I have a quiz in math Monday. My foot hurts. It's been reclining against the  chair too long. My hand hurts too. Its resting on the edge of my desk. I am getting all sticky and sweaty doing this paper. My legs are sweaty  against the seat. The back of my neck and my arms are also sweaty. Matt left his bobo feit action figure with me. He's the  bounty hunter from  star wars. I'm very surprised because he's very important to Matt. I am  honored that he did. It's on my desk right next to my pewter angel/moon and stars figurine. I got that with Matt in Florida. We went to Disney with the school marching band during spring break. The figurine cost me seventy bucks. It was definitely worth it. I've been typing for  a little over twenty minutes. Bye. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I want to start with a simple color. Let's say blue. When I think of blue I think of the ocean and where I live. I live in Brownsville Texas. It's ""on the border by the sea""  That's like the Brownsville saying. I also think of baby blankets, actually my baby blanket. This leads me to thinking about a George Strait song entitled ""Baby Blue"". It's a song about his daughter that passed away in a car accident. He's describing her eyes and what he thinks about every day. That has to be hard to deal with. A death in the family is such a detrimental thing to cope with. Fortunately my family has never had an immediate family member pass away. The closest I've been to a loved one that has died, was my great-grandmother. I've also had my girlfriend lose her great-grandmother and her grandmother right after each other. I went to those funerals. I really don't like them very much, It's extremely sad for all the loved ones mourning the death. I guess this leads me to thinking about the color black. It's weird that people usually associate things or ideas to color. I guess it's because we're such a vivid creature. Our vision capabilities are quite advanced when compared to those of other animals. We, humans, are able to see most of the spectrum, all we cant see is the ultra-violet end and the, oh I forgot, I think it's the infer red side as well. We might excel in vision, but are still very primitive in the sense of smell. When we compare our smelling to that of canines, all I can say is that they are able to smell around 100-1000 times better than us. Back to black. Jet Black is favorite color, or at least it used to be. I really enjoy viewing the colors of nature. I have found myself buying shirts the colors of nature. Like a dirt/green or pale/orange, light/yellow or sky/blue, the color of soil. I love the smell of the earth after it rains, it smells so pure, rich, I guess I associate that smell to nature. Imagine what a dog smells after it rains. Now that's something I wish I could take a whiff of. That's around 25 min. of writing. I want to say that this has been a great experience for me. It calmed me down from this hurried morning. I feel more at ease with myself, but I can't explain why. Well, I hope you've enjoyed this little talk with me. I know I'm not supposed to use ""you"" when writing a paper, but the instructions say that it's alright to fib a little in my grammar. Sorry for any misunderstandings. ""Good-bye and Good-luck. "" "
Tell me about yourself.,"Okay here I am after I've been spending tons of time trying to get a book I need. I'm not worried about it anymore. I will focus on my other homework. I need to go to the lounge and get organized before lunch. Maybe I won't eat lunch. Tonight I have a party to go to and I am excited. I need to tell my friend what time we will leave. Where will I park? Maybe we should walk, but it will be late when we come home and very unsafe. The radio is on and I'm listening to country music. It's so great and calming. comforting--reminds me of home. I am going home tomorrow. I can't wait to see my two dogs and possibly go swimming in the pool. I will also help my mom get the new restaurant organized. Sleep is a priority as well. Oh, and I'll see my friends and be able to talk locally on the phone for a change. Wow, I forgot about the chance that I will get a home cooked meal. I need to get some more clothes from home and do my huge load of laundry. I'll come home Monday evening. I need to wash my car while I'm there. I hope my roommate is occupied enough while I'm gone. She can come home with me another time. I hear people in the hall all the time. It's amazing how many are up as early as I for an 8 am class. No one talks, it's like a march to a funeral or something. without the tears and gloom, just the silence. My eyes burn because I'm so tired. I took an hour nap yesterday, but I don't have time today. I can't get my Ethernet hooked up right and it really makes me mad--I'm VERY frustrated. very chapped! I am getting uneasy now; sitting here typing this is making me realize all of the things I  need to do. I know though that I can get it done, just one thing at a time. Plus, I am doing one of those things right now. I wonder how many people here are close enough to home to go visit. I'm an hour away, not bad. I hear this song ""looking for love in all the wrong places"" and it reminds me of Eddie Murphy on the old Saturday Night Live. He did Buckwheat impersonations. I have an ache in my neck either from lack of sleep or carrying heavy books. I hope this doesn't sound like a letter. I am beginning every sentence with ""I"" but that's okay because I am supposed to notice how ""my"" thoughts flow. I wonder who ever got this computer stuff--internet, websites, etc. --started in the very, very beginning. Hmm, well, it doesn't matter that much to me. I just wish I could get my Ethernet hooked up. I like America Online, but it's tying up my phone line. That is also making my anxious right now. I guess the faster you type the longer the paper. I wonder what the other students doing this have to say. I wonder who will take their classes seriously and not. I hope I get some mail soon. I check it everyday and it's sort of depressing. I know people are writing/sending mail, but it just isn't here yet. That's my optimistic side. I hate the cold floor under my desk. I'm in jester, but I have carpet that I brought to go between the beds. I'm thinking of my friend in Alaska that will come at Christmas time. Will we have time for me to show the good stuff about Texas? My throat tightens to think of it. I stress easily. I feel a pressure to make his time here the best and to make him leave here thinking that Texas is the coolest place to be. It won't be as pretty in December though. Great, I have about 5 more minutes. My hands are slipping off this  tiny space. I have no room on my desk. I want to get a huge piece of plywood and cover it with contact paper and make a huge desk--like the people down the hall. It would be so ideal. I am getting really anxious to go to the study lounge. I feel like I'll lose the urge to do my math homework if I sit here any longer. Oh, I can't wait until the party. Matchbox 20 ( my favorite group) is going to be there!!!!! I need to remember to take my camera. I also need to iron my shorts and pick out a shirt to wear. All of this by 4 PM--I believe that's when we'll go to the sorority house and hang out a bit, then get our wristbands and head over the block party. Well, my leg is falling asleep and my eyes are really getting tired now. I wish I could go to sleep. I hate it when I can't focus because I'm so tired. I value sleep more than money it seems. If that makes any sense. I am ready to go now, I feel the pressure of having too many things to do. I will take care of my math homework first. Then biology and art history. Psychology is halfway done now, but I need to get the book. no one has it. That is also causing a little aggravation. I hate to not be fully prepared for everything. Okay, my 20 minutes are up, I feel better having done this. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Labor day weekend was awesome! I love my boyfriend so much. We were so lazy and it didn't even matter what I did with him, because just being with him was enough. We just watched movies and ate. He sent me flowers on Bid day for the sorority Pi Beta Phi. I love that he knows everything about me. He knows when I am sad, happy, etc. I really miss him right know. I hope that he can come on Sunday so that he can se my dorm room and meet my pledge sisters. I can't wait to see what he does for my birthday. I can't believe that I am going to be nineteen years old. It doesn't feel like I should be that old. It just seems like yesterday that I turned sixteen and got my driver's license. My sister is twenty-two years old and engaged. I'm so excited about being her maid of honor in the wedding. I know that I am going to be so emotional that day. Troy is so perfect for her. I know that they will have a long and happy marriage together. He is just like a brother to me. My parents are glad that they will only be an hour away from them. It seems weird that we don't live in Waco anymore. I consider Waco as my home, and not Beaumont. My parents evidently seem to like it there, even though it is so humid. I thought that Waco was humid. It is nothing compared to Beaumont. I love Adam so much!  It will be neat when his dad is in session. Maybe he will take me out to eat so I don't have to eat the dorm food all of the time. It really isn't that bad! I just hope that I don't gain the ""Freshman 15. ""  Dancing will keep me in shape, though. I love my class. Ballet three times a week is just enough times to keep me from not missing my dance studio in Waco. It is really neat to get a lot of different styles of dance from different teachers. I think that it helps and has helped me to be a more well-rounded dancer, and open to new things. I miss my friends from high school. I just talked to Ashley today. I was so excited that she called. I know that I am going to have to start writing letters and e-mailing my friends and Adam, after my one hundred dollar phone bill in ten days. I feel really bad about that, but I just didn't understand the whole ""phone bill thing. ""  As they say, everyone learns from their mistakes. I definitely had to learn the hard way, though. I hope that I have a cheaper bill next month, for my parents' sake. "

Tell me about yourself.,"This is the first time I have ever had an assignment like this before. I have never had to use the internet before, either. I wish that the computer in my room wasn't so difficult to hook up to the UT internet system. I am so tired of going to the same computer store over and over. First, they managed to sell me over one hundred dollars worth of computer equipment that I didn't need. After, that was sorted out, I had problems with the Ethernet card. Oh well, I will ask my boyfriend to fix it for me. I am so glad that he lives in Austin. I am glad that my best friend is my roommate. We always get along and we never fight. It's great because if she wasn't my roommate, then we would have a huge phone bill. So far, everything about UT is as I anticipated. I really didn't believe people when they told me that I would  have classes with over two hundred people. That came out to be half true. I only ended up with twenty or so in my English class and about one hundred and fifty in my biology class. My chemistry and psychology class end up in the same room. both are enormous. I didn't even know how to spell psychology until about three days ago. Whenever I wrote the word I always looked at the course schedule or at my textbook. Books are another problem. The co-op had the wrong listing for my biology book, and I had to go through a huge hassle to get my psych book. I shouldn't be complaining. I really love it here. I love being one in fifty thousand. I love being known as only a social security number. The atmosphere is so relaxed and go with the flow. ""  I think that I am adapting well. Twenty minutes are up. s       "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am sitting here at Hardin House, boy I am so stressed out. I have these  two writing assignments for psychology a whole bunch of pre-cal homework  and tons of reading to do for Biology and Sociology. this sorority stuff  is starting to take up way to much time. I really don't like the feeling I  am getting when I am set up with a date because it makes me feel like I am cheating on my boyfriend. I know I shouldn't feel bad since I am just being friends with them and nothing more it just really bothers me sometimes. I really don't feel like going out tonight because I still  think I am sick from yesterday. I need to go and call my mom and dad  since I haven't talked to them in about five days I am just way to busy. I think I really need to work on some major time management skills because I  am worried about getting behind and I want to get 3 As and 2 Bs so I can  start off good before my classes get too hard. I am really excited about  UT vs. OU weekend I hope that Jaycob can go so that I don't have to go with some random guy. I wish it wasn't the same weekend as my schools homecoming so that I could go home oh well. I need to take a shower and get ready  for the KA mixer and try to read and definitely watch 90210. That was 20 Minutes. THANK YOU!  HAVE A NICE DAY! "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now I am in my friend's Jester dorm to do my writing 1 with her computer. I will probably do all my writing assignments in her room because all the other computer labs in the U. T. campus are always full. It is really annoying when I have to wait to use a computer. I just don't have time to wait, since I have so much homework to do. I feel very nervous and uneasy about all my classes because this is my first year in college. People told me that the method of studying in college is different from high school. I am still not use to living in the dorm. It is too small and just doesn't feel as comfortable as home. I miss my parents, my dog, and the freedom to drive my car out. I am going to work very hard in college in order to have a very successful life. My leg and arm muscles are aching, since I played basketball and worked out at the Rec Center yesterday. I like the facility there. There is a good variety of things to do. I plan to reserve time everyday to play sports, especially basketball and tennis. The Boyz II Men new song called ""The Four Seasons"" is in my head right now. I enjoy listening to the song. It sounds very sweet and peaceful. The song reminds me of the time when my mom and dad send me off to here at U. T. I am now listening to the movie called ""Space Jam. "" My sister and my friend are in the room watching the movie. I saw the movie about half a year ago. I thought it was a very cute movie. It is amazing how the creators of the movie can mix animation with real people. My favorite basketball player, Michael Jordan, is one of the main characters in the movie. I like to watch him play basketball because he always makes incredible shots. It is so cool when Michael makes a slam dunk. He really does fly a little. I hope tomorrow will be a good day for me. I hope I won't be very nervous when I go into my classes. I have four classes to go to tomorrow! I am really excited about seeing my senior U. T. cousin tomorrow!  "
Tell me about yourself.,"I feel kind of strange doing this assignment like this -- I don't think I've ever had such an informal assignment. I just got off the phone with this girl that I met in Galveston when I was a junior in high school -- the whole time I was talking I was also thinking about how I wanted her to shut up so I could do this assignment. Well, anyway, here I am sitting before this CRT not really concentrating or doing anything special -- just king of chilling. My roommate is playing Quake on his computer on the other side of the room -- also the radio is on and so it makes it king of hard to concentrate with all the noise in the room. I think the artist on the radio is Natalie Merchant -- damn I really hate her music -- it's so poppy it's disgusting. everything the drums to guitars to vocals sounds so devoid of feeling or meaning -- it's a mind numbing, spirit-crushing experience listening to this crap . I just wish she would shut up . I prefer bands like Korn or Pantera. they sing with so much feeling, and all the songs are sung with vehemence and anger and lust and disgust and hatred. the entire spectrum of emotions is explored in their works. other favorite bands of mine are helmet, Alice in chains, pearl jam,etc. I guess I kind of got caught up in the whole alternative revolution phenomenon. I WORE FLANNEL AND HAD RIPPED UP JEANS AND DOC MARTENS AND I EVEN DID THE DRUGS THAT WENT ALONG WITH THE WHOLE ALTERNATIVE SCENE. A BIG MISTAKE IN MY OPINION BECAUSE THOSE VICES WITH WHICH I EXPERIMENTED LAST THEIR TABOO AND SO NOW I HAVE NO FEAR OF THEM AND WOULD HAVE NO QUALMS ABOUT TAKING THEM OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT THEY DESTROY YOUR BODY AND MIND. NOW I ONLY DRINK -- ANOTHER RESULT OF MY EXPERIMENTS WITH ""ALTERNATIVES"". IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE IN HIGH SCHOOL I WAS A DRUGGER AND AN ""ALTERNA-TEEN"" WHEN I WAS WISHING THAT I COULD BE A MUSICIAN. BUT NOW THAT I AM ONE -- I HAVE MY OWN BAND -- I DON'T REALLY FEEL THE NEED TO DO LIVE THE ALTERNATIVE LIFESTYLE. I DON'T DRESS STRANGE OR HAVE STRANGE HABITS. I HAVE A 4. 0 GPA AND WAS THE VALEDICTORIAN OF MY HIGH SCHOOL, SO THAT KIND OF BELIES SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE SAID HERE. bETTER MAN BY PEARL JAM JUST CAME ON THE RADIO. I LIKE THIS SONG ALOT. PEARL JAM'S NOT AS GOOD AS THEY USED TO BE. THEIR ALBUMS TEN,VERSUS AND VITALOGY ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THE ALBUM NO CODE IN MY OPINION. NO CODE SEEMS SO STERILE AND NOT PEARL JAM. I THINK IT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT DRUMMER--THE OLD DRUMMER FROM THE RED HOT CHILE PEPPERS. HE SUCKS IN COMPARISON TO DAVE ABBRUZZESE--THE OLD DRUMMER FOR PEARL JAM. I WISH THEY WOULD PUT OUT ANOTHER AWESOME ALBUM. IF THEY DID I WOULD BE VERY HAPPY. OH YEAH, MY ROOMMATE JUST REMINDED ME ABOUT THIS GIRL THAT I KNOW. SHE'S A FAT GIRL AND SHE'S KIND OF A BITCH. SHE KEEPS CALLING ME AND CALLING ME, BUT I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO HER BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE HER 'THAT' WAY AT ALL--BUT SHE LIKES ME LIKE THAT. . . . I KIND OF LIKE LIVING IN JESTER BECAUSE IT IS VERY CLOSE TO EVERYTHING THAT GOES ON CAMPUS. THE FOOD SUCKS REALLY BADLY, BUT THERE ARE PLENTY OF BEAUTIFUL GIRLS THAT LIVE HERE---SO THAT IS REALLY COOL. I JUST GLANCED AT MY WATCH BECAUSE I AM TIMING MY TIME HERE ON THIS ASSIGNMENT. I ONLY HAVE A FEW MORE MINUTES TO DO THIS ASSIGNMENT. I JUST THOUGHT ABOUT HOW DELICIOUS MY SUPPER WAS TODAY AT MY FRIEND DREW'S UNCLE'S HOUSE. WE HAD BADASS BARBECUE AND HE GAVE US BEER AND MARGUERITAS. HE WAS A REALLY COOL GUY. I WANT TO GO BACK THERE SOMETIME AND HANGOUT AGAIN. HE'S GOT A REALLY NICE HOUSE AND HE'S BUILDING A STUDIO FOR RECORDING. THAT WILL BE COOL. MAYBE MY BAND-THE GOODSIDE-WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE USE OF THIS TO RECORD SOME STUFF IN THERE. WE HAVE OUR OWN STUDIO BUT IT'S IN THE DORM ROOM SO IT'S NOT REALLY EASY TO RECORD ALL THE TIME IN THERE BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT OTHER PEOPLES' SLEEPING HABITS AND WANTS AND NEEDS--THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT SUCHS ABOUT THE DORMS. IT KIND OF CRAMPS THE LIFESTYLE OF SOMEONE WHO MAKES A LOT OF NOISE. WELL, I'VE GONE OVER MY TWENTY MINUTE MINIMUM, SO I'LL GO AHEAD A START READING FOR OTHER CLASSES. . "
Tell me about yourself.,"I hope I am doing this write!  I never really used the internet before and it took me forever to try and figure out how to log on. I feel better now that I am actually doing this, I thought I wouldn't figure it out in time then I would get a zero and bring my grade down. I am a freshman and I really want to do good. I hope my roommate isn't wandering where I am. We were supposed to do laundry after my class which was your class and ended at5. I was glad it wasn't raining when I got out because I didn't bring my umbrella. I am kind of upset that I couldn't find a smaller one than the huge one I brought. I don't want to look like a dork. I miss my boyfriend he is in San Antonio where I am from. I wish he would've gotten in to UT like me. It would have been so much fun being here with him without parents always watching over us. My time on this machine expires in ten minutes and it doesn't seem like enough time but it was almost twenty minutes that I have been typing maybe a few minutes less but it took me a while to figure out how to get here anyway. I not a very fast typer so I hope I have written enough and about the write topic that is whatever I am thinking. Well thank god I am almost done I only have one more minute so I have to push the submit button before it cuts me  off. Bye. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am thinking about the pain in my throat right now, I have mono. Soon I will find out whether or not I have strep throat. In fact , I need to call the medical center hotline later, although I guess it really doesn't matter that much because I am already taking penicillin. Last night I could not sleep at all I was in so much pain. I would try and try to forget about the pain, and finally slip of into sleep. But, then about an hour later I would wake up and wish I was dead, not literally, but I just wish the pain would go away. I can deal with feeling sick all the time because I know that will eventually go away. I have so much stuff I need to do still, but I never have the energy to do it. I miss all of my family and sometimes feel lonely, but, I guess that is part of growing up. Texas plays Rudgers this weekend here and I already have my tickets, I wonder what that whole day will be like. I also miss all of my friends from high school, but I got two letters 2 days ago. I always feel sort of lonely at the start of school. Even when I was a little kid I would be really nervous when starting school, but it always ended up getting better by the end of the year. I was so ready to get out of my house this summer, my mom and I argued all the time. But, now I seem to really miss them, I think because I am sick I miss them even more because they have always been there to comfort me when I was sick. I wonder how my brothers are doing, I haven't talked to them in a couple of weeks. Everything here at UT is overwhelming, the system just doesn't seem to care about me. The people here are nice, but the red tape is difficult to cut through. I hope I can actually make good grades in my Calculus class, which is really hard. I guess  I need to get a tutor and work on not putting my assignments off to the last minute. Computers are really interesting. They seem like part of the ""system"" and red tape involved in everything. Not that I don't appreciate or like technology, It just isnt personal at all. I need people around me in order to feel good and have fun, that is why I think I miss my family, they were always there to talk to. I know I can graduate from college, but I sometimes wonder whether or not I really can. I also wonder about the many paths my life could take. Will I be truly happy in the future? Will somebody love me enough to marry me?  Will I ever find a person I want to marry. What job will I have, how much money will I make. Will I be as successful as my Dad?  Can I live up to all of the expectations of my family?  Sometimes I see answers to these questions, I don't know how, and what are these visions, are they just part of my imagination?  I feel like time is passing and I am not really making an impact. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Every time I get one of these writing assignments my mind always seems to go blank. They tell me ""write about what is in your mind"". It shouldn't be that hard I mean I am always thinking of something. For example right now I'm thinking I shouldn't have missed breakfast. Anyway this is sort of like writing a letter to a friend where you don't have to worry about grammar and things like that. At least I hope not. I feel like the twenty minutes are never going to be over. Actually I am amazed at how fast I am typing, and I've never taking typing course in my life. Well I think I'm typing fast. I don't know how many words a minute I can type. I hope I do well in school. This place is huge. I am enjoying myself. I've never been on my own before. You can call it a learning experience. There is not much to here with out a car. I hope I get credit for this. I wonder if this one of those things were they try to get into the mind of America's youth. They probably didn't get much out of me, since I don't seem to be thinking anything interesting. Maybe I don't know to type all that well. Some people just sit down and all you here are them hitting the keys. I wish I was like that, I could finish my assignments quicker. I need to take a typing course. I also need toenail clippers. You guys probably don't want to here that, but you asked to write down what I was thinking. I also need a poncho because it looks like it's going to rain. No chance in you guys getting me one? Well the twenty minutes are up. c-ya     "
Tell me about yourself.,"as I begin this assignment its seems weird to me that I am in college  and I locating my professor on the computer I don't have to be in the room  to hand you an assignment I have to get up early for class tomorrow usually I'm in bed by now I don't know why I up, I seem to have this spurt of energy tonight I've gotten so much done tonight though I so stressed out this week but today I realize that I've been stressing over future stuff and I was looking at the wrong dates on my syllabus oops forgot to hit the return button typing is making me so much more tired  tonight when I'm done I will go to bed I love waking up in the morning its such a fresh beginning feeling forgot that stupid button again next door the music just got turned on real loud they better cut it out by the time I'm ready for bed I wish Wesley were here to go to bed with me Maryland is  so far away at 1 in the morning, not that its any closer at 2 in the afternoon but things are so much more in perspective at that time wow I bet this is really  improving my typing skills, not that they are bad I had that typing class in 9th  my back hurts this position hurts but in 9th grade that teacher what was her name. . . oh yeah Mrs. reader and she had that annoying voice. aaaaaaa now class . bbbbbbb is everyone understanding how to switch the fingers to the right letters? this class psych reminds me of my mom she is a therapist I like hearing her talk about that kind of stuff but I don't like when she uses her therapy shit on me anyway I miss her I hope her business trip is going well Virginia seems far away at one in the morning I  wonder why I typed that 1 out and just pushed the one key for the last one? anyhow or anywho I can not stand that . anywho!

Tell me about yourself.,"Ok so here I am at my computer lab and I am supposed to be typing about what is going on in my head. well nothing really, just waiting for the weekend to come and  what I am going to do . I have no idea on what I am going to do maybe Ill go  out with my roommate or my friends Kristen and tiffany, I don't know. I wish I could see Jason, I miss him so much, but he is coming down the weekend of his  birthday so Ill just wait. am I falling in love, oh well too late, I am already in love but I can't be cause Im here and he is there and I just can't do this to myself. but am I going to find somebody here. I don't want to throw myself on guys but I don't want to be just some face in the crowd. how can you meet people if  you just dont want to talk??  I dont know I dont care I do love Jason and I wish he would get his act together so my mom and dad will like him a lot more and we can have a serious relationship. It's been three years now and I can't stop  going back to him, do I just want the feeling of knowing that I have somebody or  what?  I have been a lot happier since we started talking. I don't know, I'm so  confused. I don't want to turn out like my sisters that married someone that is somewhat worthless and have no money for half of my life. I am better than that. I dont know. am I saying that too much. I am so glad that you are not reading  this because you would think I was a complete psycho. I hate English class, I ] hate to write. It sucks sooooo much. My hands are starting to hurt. I don't  practice Santeria, I ain't got no crystal ball. Well I had a million dollars but I spent it all if I could find that heina and that sancho that she found I pop a  cap in sancho and Id slap her down, well all I really want to know , I cant be and all I really want to say I cant define blah blah blah blah that I s one of my \favorite songs but I cant remember some of the words oh, well   I have a lot more time new song, Im on a one way street with a one night stand with a one track mind out in no man's land, the punishment sometime don't seem to fit the crime , yeah there's a hole in my soul but the one thing Ive learned for every love letter written is  another one burned now you tell me how it's going to be this time is it over, is it over cause I m blowing out the flame, take a walk outside your mind, tell me how it feels to be the one who turns the knife inside of me. ok new stuff lets talk about what I am going to do for Jasons birthday. I will hopefully get some goods from Jennifer and then get a hotel room and we can \smoke out in the hotel room and get really drunk and pass out but before we pass out we have to do some stuff. If I  had access to all the drugs in the world like so well where all I would have to do is have money and call one person, I would be the biggest addict in the world, well not the biggest but pretty close. I love doing drugs, I love getting drunk, I guess Im just curious about this , once I try it I might not like it but I have to at least try first, oh I think my  20 minutes are up in four mor3e minutes do you want to here me sing. Maybe this time  I'll be lucky Maybe this time he'll stay Maybe this time for the first time love will hurry away he will hold me fast Ill be home at last not a loser any more like the last time and the time before every body loves a winner so nobody love me lady peaceful, lady happy that's what I long to be well all the odds are, there in my favor  somethings bound to begin IT'S GONNNA HAPPEN, HAPPEN SOMETIME, MAYBE THIS TIME I'LL WIN!!!!!!!! CAUSE everybody oh they love a winner, so nobody love me lady peaceful, lady happy, that's what I long to be well all the odds are , there in my favor something's bound to begin IT'S GONNA HAPPEN, HAPPEN SOMETIME, MAYBE THIS TIME , MAYBE THIS TIME I'LL WIN!!!!! "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now I'm sitting here at my brothers house. I'm very tired and wish I was in my bed. We had a Tri-Delt meeting tonight and I'm so overwhelmed with all the stuff we have to do. It just seems like their is something everyday. I wish I could just do some stuff and not all of it. I hate other people having control over me and telling how I have to spend my afternoon. I just want to be able to study, meet people, and sleep. Maybe I shouldnt have joined a sorority. Oh well!  I just need a break everything is happening so fast and I'm having second thoughts about the whole Tri-Delt thing because I really don't know anybody yet. Maybe once I start to meet people I feel more comfortable. I'm very excited because my dad is coming to Austin thurs-sunday. He is going to the game with us and taking us out to eat. I haven't talked to my dad in awhile so I can't wait to see him. I guess I'm a little homesick or at least more than I let show. I just worry that I/m the only one feeling this way and I don't want to look like a big crying baby to my roommate. But I don't really care what my roommate thinks because she gets on my nerves have the time and is not that much fun to be around. She is not interested in the same stuff I am and just sits around and plays on the computer. Well enough about that. I'm really hungry but I dont want to eat anything because I worry about gaining the freshman 15. All my roommate eats is fat fat FAT. So their is all kinds of junk food in my room and I get tempted to eat it. She isn't worried about her weight. I very excited because this girl who is one of my pledge sisters asked me to room with her next year in an apartment with to other girls. She is real nice and I was surprised that she asked me to live with her. I said yes but I will have to talk to my mom because she is the one paying for everything. Last night was the weirdest thing I set down and started thinking about all my friends that are off at different schools. This was the first time that I had the chance since I've been here to think about everyone and wonder what they are doing. I even thought about my camp friends and how it seems like a year ago that I was with them. It was just two months ago. I wish I was back their right now because I had no worries and was so happy with everyone their. Well it has been 20 min. so I guess I'll let you go. Got to go study!!!!! "
Tell me about yourself.,"that's no good. I was informed as I entered the room that my friend tom's  girlfriend broke up with him. they were engaged;  I hope he comes  through this ok. he gets depressed sometimes,  and uses poor judgement. wow . . . it just occurred to me the more complex problems I face as I age. there's a  volleyball game going on outside in the jester courtyard (I assume . . . tom's roommate insists that it's a drunken festival of debauchery - I can't see out the window). I find their play loud and distracting, but the courts are there for that  purpose and I have no right to complain. the stereo turned off and I find the only noise in the room to be that of my typing. I like music as I work. it  helps me to concentrate. I find that Im considerably addicted to sound. when I was younger (and not paying an electric bill) I even needed music to sleep. I listened to my  Beatles record whi9le I cooked dinner tonight. chicken fried steak,  mashed potatoes and abbey road  -  fantastic combination. I found that there's a slight scratch  on ""Mr. mustard""  -  those bastards at the record shop are supposed to be honest about the condition of the albums . . . it would be easier had they allowed me to  listen to it before I bought it. what kind of record shop has no turntable?  still, Im glad to have it - I collect old vinyl from some of my favorite groups . . . certain bands have a different sound and feel on record. I started collecting  when my brother bought me ""working man's dead. ""  he originally inspired my interest in the grateful dead,  I guess that fits. I have discovered in the past few years  just how, in my younger days, I religiously aspired to be like my brother. he's a great guy . . . Im glad that he's succeeding in life - we went through some troubling stages together. I miss him when Im at school. it's been five years since we lived in the same house,  but at school Im 200 miles away rather than across town. tom's talking on the phone to one of our friends,  Andrew,  who goes to school  at Vanderbilt. computers are amazing things - my phone bill would be outrageous if I couldn't e-mail my friends who attend school in other states. he's talking about the ""break-up"" now. this whole situation sucks. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I went to my sorority's crush party last night. I didn't really know what to expect because they had it at Buffalo Club and I don't dance, I don't smoke, and I certainly don't look 21. At any rate, I wasn't having very much fun after 30 minutes. At that point a guy came up to me and asked me to dance, I figured it couldn't be any worse than standing around so I said yes. We ended up hanging around with each other the entire evening. We exchanged phone numbers and I kind of figured that was the end of it. It was about twelve-thirty when I drank half of my ""big sister's"" Long Island Iced Tea and I have to say I think that it really impaired my judgement. I got talked into going to Dance Across with three of my sorority sisters and the guy who had been hanging around me. I had fun, we danced, but he isn't exactly the kind of guy I'm particularly attracted to. For some reason I put that aside, became extremely flirtatious, and even let him French kiss me after having met him only four hours before. I feel really cheap now, I never do things like that. I don't really know what the reason for my actions was (I'm blaming it on the drink, but that's probably not the problem because the effects had worn off before the end of the evening). Maybe I'm somewhat lonely, it's been about three months since I've had a boyfriend. The problem is that I woke up this morning and regretted last night. I feel like I used this guy, I didn't mean to. Maybe it's not that I don't want a boyfriend, maybe it's that I don't want him as a boyfriend. The worst thing about this is that I've been in his position before (having someone kiss me than decide they don't want me, in fact, it was last week) but it hurt my feelings and I think it's extremely insensitive of me to do the same thing to someone else. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am so mad right now that I can't believe it. I wrote out an entire  stream of consciousness thing and I pressed cancel instead of submit which  erased my entire writing assignment!!  I am so angry and tired and I just don't feel like doing this anymore. I can't believe that I am so stupid!! Why am I doing this anyway??  It doesn't seem like it's doing any good  and I don't see what it's serving. I don't have anything to write about anymore and I don't even know If I'm doing this thing right in the first place. I don't know if I'm supposed to be pressing enter at the end of each line or if Im just supposed to write to infinity on one line or if I should press enter. I don't know. I don't think I even care right now. I'm cold too. my dorm room is always so cold. I don't know why we put the AC on so high maybe because Austin is always so freaking hot!  Why is it so hot anyway?  I hate Texas. I wish that we never moved from NJ; the weather was always so good there it was never too hot or too cold. I miss my friends too. I don't know what to do right now. or what to do when I'm done with this stupid assignment. great, I have  about fifteen more minutes left. what the hell. why is this taking so damn long sorry about the swearing but I'm just really pissed right now. I'm also tired  because I went shopping with my girlfriend today for over 7 hours and I'm  so fatigued mentally and physically. How do girls do it?  How can anyone possible walk for seven hours straight and not get tired. In that respect I completely admire them. wow. not left with anything left to say. I must have . who the hell is making so much noise in the hall way?  this dorm is always too loud!!! I just want to move to an apartment and get some privacy. I hate these public  bathrooms, they're so unsanitary. I'm having trouble breathing now. My  asthma is acting up again. probably because it's so cold in here. I wonder what my girlfriend is doing right now. She left in a hurry after she dropped me off. That's the gratitude I get for going shopping with her for so long. I bet  whoever is reading this thing is hating the fact that I can type 65 words per minute and I bet she is getting tired of reading all this crap. I'd go crazy if I have to  read ten of these things, much less over three hundred. Man I can't breath. I need to get my inhaler. I think I need to go to the bathroom too. but I can't leave this computer to do it. Oh boy. what is life getting to?  wow only ten more minutes before I am done!!  and I still don't know what to write about. Those  people sure are making a lot of noise out there in the parking lot. OH. I wonder who won the UT football game?  I guess we did since the tower is lit  up orange. but I wonder what the score was. I think I need to ask someone. Not that I actually care about football in the first place. my leg is itching why do we have so many nestle crunch bars laying around here anyway?  I think we need to give some away. ouch I just got a really big stomach ache. all of a sudden I'm really really tired. I want to get some sleep. I never get enough sleep in college seven minutes left. good. I need a haircut. I'm too tired to think. My ear canal itches now my face and shoulder itch. I can't do this anymore. I'm debating whether or not I should just submit this thing and say that I wrote for twenty minutes since I type faster than most people anyway. No one would ever be able to tell the difference. only five more minutes. I can't think of anything to write. I need to call my girlfriend but her line was busy the last time I checked. I think her roommates are on the phone line. need some sleep why the hell cant I just stop??!?!?!?   I'm so tired. My arms are getting heavy. I'm not thinking  of much anymore. can't lift my fingers. Think Ill just sit here a while and hope that time will fly by quicker. easiest thing to do is zone out and not think of anything at all, that way I won't have to type anything. but then  again here I am still typing. what the hell. I can't win either way. I need my inhaler really bad now. I can hardly breathe. only one more minute. can't think of anything to say getting really really anxious now. come on. um. I guess that's it then. I've got no more to say. "
Tell me about yourself.,"WELL, I DON'T LNOW WHAT ALL TO TYPE ABOUT, SINCE WE CAN TYPE ABOUT ANYTHING. MY BOYFRIEND THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN SINCE I MOVED DOWN HERE THREE WEEKS AGO CAME DOWN TODAY FROM DALLAS, SO I'M PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. I WISH HE DIDN'T HAVE TO LEAVE ON MONDAY, BUT HE HAS SCHOO, ASLO. MY ROOMMATE IS ON THE COMPUTER NEXT TO ME, READING ABOUT EL NINO, AND HER BOYFRIEND IS WATCHING ME TYPE. THIS COMPUTER LAB STINKS. MY BOYFRIEND IS BORED OUT OF HIS MIND, BECAUSE HE WANTS TO PLAYS GAMES BUT CAN'T GET ON A COMPUTER. I THINK THIS PSYCHOLOGY COURSE IS GOING TO BE HARD, BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE IN THE CLASS. FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLR IS A BIT TOO MANY PEOPLE TO HAVE IN ONE CLASS--HOW WILL ANYONE LEARN ANYTHING?  ALSO, THE WHOLE EXPERIMENT THING IS VERY STRANGE. WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO STUDY ABOUT US?  I SURE AS HECK AM NOT GOING TO WRITE A RESEARCH PAPER, THOUGH. I HATE WRITING PAPERS!  I'M GLAD THAT WE DON'T HAVE A FINAL IN OUR CLASS. BUT I HAVE A FINAL IN MY PHILOSOPHY CLASS, AND IT'S ALSO ON THE LAST DAY. THAT SUCKS. I WAS HOPING I COULD GO HOME AND WORK DURING THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS, BUT SINCE I WON'T LEAVE UNTIL DECEMBER 16, THAT'S NOT GOOD. AT LEAST WE DON'T HAVE TO BE BACK UNTIL JANUARY 20, THOUGH!!  THAT IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME. AARON AND I ARE BOTH GROWING IMPATIENT. I FEEL LIKE I HAVE BEEN TYPING FOR AN HOUR, BUT IT HAS ON;Y BEEN TEN MINUTES. I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL TONIGHT. ME, AARON, MANDA, AND BRANNON ARE GOING OUT TO EAT AND TO SEE G. I. JANE. I'VE BEEN WANTING TO SEE THAT MOVIE FOREVER. IF BRANNON DOESN'T SHUT UP, I'M GOING TO BACK HAND HIM. AARON IS PLAYING WITH THE MOUSE AND IT IS DRIVING ME CRAZY. NOW HE'S LAUGHING UP A STORM, AND IT IS ALSO DRIVING ME CRAZY. BRANON IS A PERVERT. O, EXCUSE ME, HE THINKS HE'S ROMANTIC. NOW WE'RE ALL LAUGHING AND TALKING ABOUT DON JUAN DEMARCO, WHOEVER HE IS. I AM SO HUNGRY. I HAVEN'T EATEN ALL DAY, AND MY STOMACH FEELS LIKE IT'S GONNA CAVE IN. NOW AARON IS TALKING ABOUT TACO BELL, AND I'M GOING TO VOMIT. I HATE TACO BELL, AS WELL AS ALMOST ALL FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS. NOW AARON IS READING WHAT I AM TYPING, AND IT IS ANNOYING ME. NOT REALLY, ALMOST EVERYTHING HE DOES I THINK IS CUTE. I MISS HIM A LOT, I'M REALLY GLAD HE'S HERE THIS WEEKEND. HE'S FIXING TO MOVE DOWN HERE IN A MONTH, BECAUSE HE'S GRADUATING FROM THE ART INSTITUTE OF DALLAS ON SEPTEMBER 30, THE SAME DAY AS OUR FIRST EXAM. NOW THEY ARE TALKING TALKING ABOUT HOW NASTY UNDERSHIRTS LOOK. IF AARON PICKS AT HIS FOOT ONE MORE TIME I'M GONNA SLAP HIM. NOW MY TIME IS UP, I'M REALLY GLAD. "
Tell me about yourself.,"For some odd reason, I felt really cold all day long. Whether I was in my room or just walking around campus, my insides felt really cold and hollow. Maybe it is due to the fact that I had to come back today. All weekend long I was at home in Round Rock. The thought of having to come back really annoyed and made me nervous for no particular reason. Sometimes I get in this really dark mood and I imagine myself attending all these funerals, and all I can see is black and empty space. I wonder why I feel this way sometimes, but I always come out of this zone and cannot even remember what triggered me to have these images or feelings. Whenever I get this way, all I see is the vision of someone dying or screaming in pain from something so horrible that cannot be explained. Once, I had this dream and I witnessed what seemed like the end of the earth; I came face to face with celebrities that only I dreamed of meeting, and when someone would die, their name and accomplishments in life would be announced on an intercom. You see everyone was captured in this underground tunnel type of cave and we were all waiting for the tide to come in and take us away. As soon as I heard my name, birth date, and my few accomplishments in life, I could taste the saltwater in my mouth and that is when I woke up crying and all wet from sweat. I was really scared and curious to why I had such a dream, but I could never really comprehend what really happened, nor could my friends. Some of my friends gave me back some interesting feedback, but the majority of them thought I was definitely insane. But after that weird experience, I have not had another experience like that one. The cool thing is that one of my good friends was doing an interview the next day on weird things that people experience and she interviewed me. My quote "" I witnessed the end of the world"", was in the school paper. Some of her friends on the staff wanted to talk to me about my dream, but I figured since they heard everything I had to say in the paper, there was no reason for me to elaborate any further. Another weird encounter I have had with near death was that in my dream, I was at my mother's funeral. The weird thing was that her death was due to cancer. Well that seemed kind of odd because there was never any talk about my mother ever being sick. Well in my dream, I felt so alone and cried out to her and became hysterical. I couldn't help myself. When I woke up from the dream, I was crying and I was covered all over with sweat. Those two dreams are the only serious ones I've come upon. But I wonder why I have such dreams; could it be a result of my odd days when I feel dark and hollow, or is it caused by some stress factor experienced during the day sometime. I have heard that people have weird dreams when they can't sort out all their problems during the day. I am really interested in why people have odd dreams and would like to further study the factors as well as reasons that cause these events. Whenever I have a dream, I hate the fact how I can never remember the following day, even though it's what wakes me up. Why is it that one can have a dream and after he awakens, he can no longer remember what or who was in it. I would really like to study the causes of our dreams and the reasons why we become so disturbed, yet can remember nothing. It would be interesting if someone did an experiment on students as a project; to detect and understand maybe the basis for having dreams. "
Tell me about yourself.,"  There is this chomping sound coming from my brothers mouth. He's eating cereal. Sometimes I am jealous of this, because he  has his own place with a kitchen and food and everything. Even  Quinby has his own place with a kitchen and everything. Someday  I will have these things for myself. My own life, with my own things. Like in Days of Our Lives. There will be days of my life when I  do what I want, with whomever I choose. Until then I must continue  doing things their way . Everyone elses way, like my mom. My nose  itches. It is a very natural thing to scratch an itch, or itch a  scratch?  It is very annoying to itch. When I got sunburned, I  itched extremely badly. Sara laughed at me because I was jumping  around in discomfort. I never want to feel like that again. Sunburns suck. I miss Sara though. Even though I did not see her  much, I always knew she was just down the street. But things are  different now. That made it sad for me to leave. The fact that  she isn't down the street anymore. That was like a security for me. Just knowing. I am in a hurry to finish this assignment. I have to be in class in about half an hour, and I am nowhere close to where I need to be. Life can make you feel like that. Like you are never at the right point, where you need to be. Everything in never alright. That's and oxy-moron. Things don't  work that way. But things do tend to work themselves out. You just  have to keep moving to get through the bad stuff. I always want  something better. I feel like I am always in transit. It's had for  me to be happy with the present. At least I can let go of the past, now. That was an accomplishment for me, not to dwell on memories anymore. Still, I look forward to, and fear the future. I do know things are good  now. I am on my own, a little bit. I don't want to rush things. I am in no hurry to grow up. Well, not a big hurry at least. I do want the rest of my life to come. I want to marry Quinby, have  a house, and pets. I am going to have a rabbit. Maybe two. Kids  eventually, but not for a long while. The television is such a distraction!  I can get side tracked forever. I like how it takes me out of this life. It is definitely  an escape. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Today has been an interesting day. I woke up late from a bad dream and instantly felt I was in a bad mood. Then I went into the kitchen to have a bowl of cereal and I thought I would read the morning paper the Austin American Statesman to keep up the what is going on in the death of Diana, Princess of Whales. Since I am starting out in my major right now, which is Journalism, I find it most fascinating that such a huge world story would be at the forefront of all media coverage in every medium. It seems strange that I am 29 years old and am just beginning to read the newspaper for the first time. It is somewhat embarrassing to think it has taken me this long to be interested in my professed major. I am actually studying Public Relations, but I have to study Journalism as the foundation for my study. I guess I chose PR because my dad is the Public Information Officer for the Portland Fire Bureau. He has worked there for over 25 years and I used to accompany him to work on some occasions when I was a kid. I think I liked going to the fairs where his fire prevention trailer was set up and we had displays of actual things that had been found after a fire was extinguished. Also, we would show films on fire prevention with animated characters that would appeal to other kids. I liked watching those and helping rewind the film to show it again and again. Also, I loved helping pass out junior fire fighter badges to kids as they came in and out of the trailer.  Oops!!  I just got interrupted by a phone call while typing. It was my husband's Professor that is the chair on his dissertation. Her name is Nina and I always joke with Thomas that she likes him and is trying to snatch him away from me. I don't really believe it, but I like to tease him. I know Thomas will be very faithful to me. That is one of the things I love most about him. Anyway. Getting back to an original point from what touched me this morning was the fact that I read more articles in the paper about the death and mourning of Diana, Princess of Whales. I think the articles have caused me to deeply admire the princess and the life she led that I didn't even know about before. I don't worship Princess Di, but I feel very saddened by the fact that she is now gone. The articles revealed how much she is the People's Princess and how everyone from all corners of the world are in deep distress about her death. I think to myself, wow!  What kind of person is this to touch so intimately so many lives and to cause nations upon nations to mourn her so. She did many wonderful things for the poor and she had a genuine interest in helping children and AIDS victims. She was the compassionate and humane side of people that reached out and gave others hope, not by elevating herself, but by being a servant. In some ways, I see her doing a Christian's work of being a servant and helping and loving those less fortunate. I believe it is the most wonderful thing when people have power and/or fame which demands mass attention and respect. I love it when these people use their power in a positive way to reach out to humanity and make the world a better place by showing grace, mercy, and compassion to all peoples of the world and not just the rich or other famous. I am so grateful that we still have people in this world who are motivated by the integrity of wanting to make things great instead of showing off how much power they have, or worse yet. by abusing that power for evil purposes or intentions. I am feeling very sad once again. Why is that these wonderful people who reach out and make positive impacts on us are usually plucked out of our presence at such young ages. I wish that humanity as a whole would be more on the positive side and looking for the good in each person. Why do we judge one another and value others more highly than another. I believe every human life is precious and deserves respect and dignity. I am thankful for people such as Princess Diana and for the example she has been to so many. That brings me to another reoccurring thought. Is it good enough to just be special or important to others or does one have to prove themselves worthy of esteem by his or her works. I believe we are saved by grace and not by works lest any man should boast. God wants us to recognize that He is the one in control and we will not realize how good life can be until we recognize who is the giver and taker or life and turn to Him for guidance and help in this life. So getting back to my earlier point, taking Princess Diana as an example. Some people are mad that we are celebrating or focusing rather on the death and life of Princess Diana this whole week in the media. Well, why not. she touched so many around the world personally as well as through the charities and campaigns she was devoted to. Isn't it important to take a least a week to honor her for who she was and what she stood for, like why her death has left so many people feeling distraught. Yet others complain that it is old news already (only three or four days after the accident), or people are just bored with all the coverage because after all she was just a foreign princess who didn't DO anything like make new laws or something important like that. My goodness!!!  That just burns me up that people equate how important you are by what you have produced or established. That is unfair. I think there are lots of things made, established, what have you that doesn't mean much to society as a whole. Every day there are new pieces of legislation or rules or ideas that have zero impact on me or others in the world. Why should the proposers of those things mean more to me than someone who has actually gone out and visited the sick and dying, who has given of him or herself personally for causes they believe in. I know that when we die, all we take with us our memories of relationships we've made and times spent with family, friends, or colleagues. Why is this world so focused on accomplishments that are so ME-centered than spending our time reaching out to others with help, hope, and healing. Why can't we share one another's burdens instead of always gratifying ourselves. Haven't people realized that there is no joy greater than serving others and using your gifts and talents to reach out and build up relationships has a joy unlike any other. My wish is that people will carry on Princess Di's compassion for those less fortunate and would continue the torch of servitude to give others hope, help, and healing. We could be such a strong world if we would only learn to love and serve one another.  Well, this has definitely succeeded the 20 minute allotment. I thank you for reading this, or at least for allowing me to get these things off of my chest. It has been aching in my heart a lot this past week. We need more heroes like Diana. She is an example to us all. It is so tragic that my profession of journalism is what helped put an end to the life of one so dear and so special. I pledge my spirit to use my journalism skills to expose our true heroes for the building up of mankind, not to drag it down even to the death. "
Tell me about yourself.,"  I am so glad that I came home this weekend. I really miss all of my friends and family. I feel like I need to be studying for some of my classes right now. I want to but I also want to spend time with my family. I need to go shopping today. I still need to buy an answering machine and some shower shoes. I really like UT, but I just feel so lonely sometimes. I am so used to being in high school and seeing all of my friends every day. I am so used to being able to ask any of them for help with homework when I needed it. I really miss them. Now most of them have gone so far away and I won't see them for a long time. I am so happy that I got to see Vicky yesterday. I had not seen her in a long time, but it is almost as if I had never left. I can't believe all the things that she told me yesterday that I had never knew before. I am nervous about going back to class on Tuesday. I am so afraid that I am not going to do well in college, but I really want to . I feel like I am already behind because I have alot to do. I am starting to get hungry now. I haven't eaten all day and my stomach is starting to hurt. I can't believe that Princess Diana died. It is so hard to believe. I feel so bad for her kids. I feel like I have so much to do today, but I don't know where to start. I am so tired. I want to go back to sleep. I want to go out and do something tonight. I haven't gone out in so long, and I am tired of staying home every night. I don't want to sit at home and watch TV again. I wonder if mom and dad are going to go somewhere again tonight. I hope that they don't. I would rather them just stay home with me. I wonder why Michael is acting so weird. Sometimes he is nice to me, but then sometimes he won't even talk to me. I really dont want to buy anything today. I have been spending so much money and I feel like I am running out. Maybe mom and dad will help me out and pay for a few things. I wish that the rest of my friends were here. I really miss them. When me and Vicky were talking about them yesterday, it made me miss them even more. Now I am feeling like I was on Friday. I was in such a dreary mood because I felt so alone. I wish I could see more people that I knew at UT. I wish that my parents would stop nagging me all of the time. Sometimes I feel that I can never do anything to please them. I ready to go back to Austin. I cant study when I am at home. There are too many thing to distract me from doing it. I am really hungry now. I think that I will go and get something to eat. "
Tell me about yourself.,"So it's time for me to start writing this assignment and I'm really tired. I've been studying all day and my brain just can't take it     I've decided that the brain must be like a muscle in that if you don't work it out regularly it gets out of shape. Right new my brains fat  fat. But that's OK. I've started running and through running I'm going to learn  more self discipline. It's really annoying the way the screen doesn't return automatically I wonder why the heck it doesn't do it. I guess it's some programming error  but surely it can't be hard to do. I've decided that running is just a conversation. One between your body and mind. Your body says ,""Hey I don't  feel very good can we please stop. "" And your mind says ""I know but we're almost there can you give a little more. Lately when I've been running I have been giving up before my body has too. This is further proof to me that my brain need conditioning. For the past year or 2 I have given up running for Aikido. I've decided to get back into running. Man this isn't very stream of consciousness. I wonder if anyone will ever read this. I seriously doubt it that's one big \ freaking class. But at least I know one pretty girl. Now that I think of it why the heck does this form ask for sex. I mean are they going to do some kind of statistical  analysis or something?  No way what could you do? count words? When I think of psy class I think mostly about the pretty girl I know in there. I'm helping her out with this computer stuff. I wonder if she has a boy friend. I wonder why I care. I sure don't need a girlfriend right now. This is the first  semester of my new life with my new major. Don't need no girly distractions. I about an hour I'm going to see a movie with my home crowd . /We're seeing swingers. I like it because it's a ""nice guy"" movie. with realistic camera shots. Wow it's already been twelve minutes. Over halfway there. Man I hope the research part of this course doesn't take up too much time. I think it out to be extra credit or something. Maybe they should defray the cost of the course or pay us or something I hate being a free guinea pig How the hell do you spell guinea. I 'm sick of paying fees toot this university. When I was at UNT I didn't have to pay sooo many hidden fees. They always lurking around the corner. Today was a pretty good day . Except for playing the stupid video game before starting this I have been very productive. I went to a habitat for humanity meeting. Maybe I'll start  doing that on Saturdays. I'm hesitant to commit though because this is my new and improved life. I hope my grades improve this semester or I'm just going to have to quit school or something. I'm kind of tired of school. I want to  get my hand on the real world and start making a difference. Its amazing how much Ive been using the letter a and how terrible a typing job I have been doing. ,  Its my roommates keyboard. Its extra sensitive or something. I wonder why I keep cutting off the middle of words whenever I hit return . You'd think it would bee natural for me to hit return whenever I finish a word My fingers are cold. This room is 60 degrees. Man I wish they'd turn up the air. "
Tell me about yourself.,"today if the first Sunday that I have been here alone and it is interesting because I dont have my parents looking over my shoulder telling me what to do. I can just walk out of my room and go have a cigarette. this is different because before I would have to think up an excuse to go and have one. my feet are cold right now and I need to take a shower. I didn't get up till about 11:45. the MTV music video awards and not very exciting and I am tired of listening to all of these peoples memories about their favorite moments. they, the awards are just a simple kind of propaganda. Michael Jackson does like little boys and should stop trying to cover it up with all those insignificant women. the only reason he wants children are for the obvious. it sucks he has that kind of problem. many people do like to eat corn but they dont seem to serve it here in the jester cafeteria. I wonder if this is going to get through because I cant even send my mom an email. it would suck if it didn't. this is the largest class I have ever been in. I hope it is the most interesting. I need to check how much money is in my account. I came with alot and am still wondering how much I will leave with. Dana Carvey is a funny guy and I figure he had a bad childhood because his brother is a bearded man who rarely says a word. I miss running track. I need to go and workout but will when Im done. Hanson is the most ridiculous group in the whole world. if they can make it I know that I can. I am really infatuated with this girl and hope that I run into her again, actually there are two that I am. Eddie Murphy is a pimp. I cant believe that princess Diana died. I think that she staged her own death to get away from the photographers. she had been harassed her whole life and would have and could have been driven to such extremes. I do not know how long I've been writing but will keep writing for another ten minutes. I feel like Beavis and butthead because I am verbalizing all of my thoughts. I stayed up till three oclock last night and still slept nine hours. the song by Aerosmith, dude look like a lady, is it about a homosexual or a crossdresser. is cross dresser one or two words. I still think that notorious b. i. g. and tupac are still alive. I need to get the c. d. tom petty and the heart breakers greatest hits because I miss listening to them. I still seems I havent written that much. van halen is so cool, not. this is ridiculous my thoughts. Daisy fuentes is hot and Im glad that she is not bald. what is Marilyn masons deal ?>????. he is a freak and I had the pleasure of meeting him and his band in the theatre. he was busy throwing gummy worms at the people attempting to watch star wars. he reminded me of a lost child. maybe thats why he dresses like he does. he is a freak. the chocolate milk in the cafeteria is good. I kind of want to go to breakfast tomorrow because I have never eaten in the morning in the cafeteria. I have done absolutely nothing today and I thoroughly like it. I do need to go and take a shower because that would be proper. I wonder how many people only take showers every other day. I wonder if commercials actually do influence the ways people buy products. that's it has been twenty minutes. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, it's becoming quite obvious to me now that the homework is beginning to pile on, but I'm perfectly okay with that because of all the stuff I went through last year in school. I did one of these for my psy class in high school and I remember some of the stuff I wrote about was quite funny, but hey, it's a stream of conscience. I actually love doing these kinds of things because for the majority of the time, the way we think is a stream, and it's never-ending. I really want to play tennis sometime soon, but today I just don't have the energy. I wonder when I'm going to get physically ill from staying up so late every night, and changing my habits a great deal. I'm getting quite used to the college way of life now. It's rather scary that I'm becoming more and more comfortable with calling my Jester dorm ""home"". I definitely miss my bed in my real home. I wonder what else I have to do tonight. I love having all the assignments, tests, papers, quizzes, etc. ahead of time so I can plan ahead and not be able to  blame my teacher if I forget something. This is really good for typing practice. I love my schedule, yeah tomorrow's a terrible day for classes, but aren't all Mondays terrible. I can't believe my hand is cramping up already. That has got to be a bad sign. Sometimes I really am not sure if I'd want people to know my stream of conscience. At times it can make people sound very stupid, like now. I'm very excited I received a call from Jeff tonight, he's such a great friend and I haven't seen him or talked to him since I left Albuquerque. That's a terrible word to spell, but hey, living there my whole life I should be able to do it in my sleep. Oh, sleep, that sounds like a great idea. I am way too tired to do anything, but that's when I need to force myself, and just get into a studying groove. I'm really not looking forward to the noisy people that will be hanging out below my window tonight, playing guitar, singing, talking loudly, until early hours of the morning. Then I'll have to call down to the Jester  desk again and complain. They must hate me by now. I wonder when I follow up for the psy experiments. My roommate has way too much stuff around her desk, but she lets me use her computer, so it's a fair trade. I love typing, although crazy as it may sound, I do. I am just itching all over. I want to go outside, but I really don't feel like leaving the comfort of my room and face the people of Jester. I am terribly blind with out my glasses or contacts. I really need to call in my contact prescription tomorrow, so I can actually see. I feel that I've been more tired lately because I haven't had my contacts, and I'm self conscious about my glasses, so it's quite a strain on my eyes, and as a result, I am more tired. I just lost complete track of my thoughts. Oh well, must start on a new track, I mean isn't that the purpose of the exercise. Speaking of exercise, I really want to get out and run a few laps, I know that it would help in being so tired. I'm tired of the Jester food, I've been living off of bagels, not from Jester. My roommate just came in and told me something that changed my thought pattern and now I'm concerned with the issue of how guys talk about girls, and how they treat girls. The whole issue is a problem of some sort in everyone's life, I just wish I didn't have to deal with it. I am quite addicted to diet cokes and diet drinks in all, I think I have a serious problem, yet I live for it. I feel like one right now. Boy do I need to do laundry. It just keeps piling up, of course the one day I finally decide to do it, everyone else has the same idea. I can't wait to go through the dorm experience, and then move on into an apartment and have things of my own. I wonder if I will have an apartment next year, and I wonder who would be my roomie(s) then, if any. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, I figured I should write this right now while I have time. I am really busy lately. It kind of seems like I have no time for myself anymore. I am trying out for crew. There are a lot of people trying out though. I think like 130 people are going for 32 spots. I hope I make it though because I don't deal well with failure. I tried out for the soccer team and did not make it, but that was a little unfair because I did not know the work out to prepare for and everyone else did. So now everyone probably thinks I just wasn't good enough when that really was not the reason. I was just too exhausted after running to play with any skill. Oh well. I guess it taught me how to cope with failure. But it really hurts every time I fail. I tried to get into the business school and was denied. That got me so mad. There are all of these total morons in the business school. I know because I take classes with them and always make better grades than them. But alas, they can do what they want with their lives they entered right out of high school. Oh well. I am still going pre-law so it doesn't matter. Unfortunately my roommate and a lot of my friends are in it, so it is a constant reminder that I did not get in. But I think that all of this just makes me a stronger person. I am trying to be really involved this year. I am lifeguarding for the rec center. It is kind of fun, but I kind of dread going to work all the time. I just seem to have a lot of things on my plate. I had a fight with my boyfriend the other day. I am not sure if it was his fault or if I caused it because of all the stress I am under. Oh well. I think that things have really changed between me and my roommate too. Last year we used to be like best friends, but now things are different. She seems to be really distant. I am not sure what is wrong with her. Maybe it is my fault. I am not around as much as I used to be, so maybe she just wants more attention and is finding it elsewhere. She also has a boyfriend, so she spends a lot of time with him, which is fine with me. I just feel like things have totally changed. She went to a party last night and didn't invite me. Weird. I think I am really different from most people. I always seem to put everyone else's feelings before mine. I just don't understand why people don't do that. Or maybe I don't understand why I do that. Like, I would invite everyone to come with me if I was doing something cool. But all the people around me just I think are selfish. Maybe I just need to find a whole new group of friends. I mean, I had my first day of tryouts for crew, which was a pretty big deal to me. And when I see my boyfriend, he doesn't even ask how I did. He totally forgot about it. That gets me so mad. He seems to forget about everything. He then says how he is a bad boyfriend. Unfortunately, I have to agree with him. But don't get the wrong impression of me. I am actually a very happy person. I am just going through a lull right now. Once I get into a normal routine in my life I think I will be a lot happier. I just wish that my family was here. My parents live in Virginia, and it is hard with them so far away. At least my brother is here with me. That makes it a lot easier. I don't know what I would do if he wasn't here. I never realized how dependent I was on other people. I always thought of myself as a kind of loner, but I guess I really am not. I like being around people, and maybe I do get jealous when they do not choose to be with me. I think I really need to work on the jealousy thing. That is probably why I am having problems with my boyfriend. He finally made some friends here, so he hangs out with them. I think I also don't really trust him. I don't want him sharing intimate things about us to them. He was asking me the other day why I back away from intimacy and am afraid to talk about it. I just don't like talking about it. I consider it a private thing, and should just be shared between two people. It is nobody else's business. But I guess since we are in college, that is the way things are. Sex is on everyone's mind. But it just doesn't really seem to be on my mind very much. I would much rather just cuddle that have sex. Maybe I am weird, I don't know. But that drives my boyfriend crazy. He want's to have sex all the time. I think that is a major problem in our relationship. Oh well. Well, I guess my time is about up. I now have to go to crew again. I should do good today because it is strength training. I am pretty confident about that. Well, I guess I only have one more of these to write. That relieves some of my stress. Actually this was pretty cool doing this. I could just write down what I have been keeping inside. Pretty neat. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Ok. Stream of. ""Come as you are. I wonder if anybody actually misses Kurt Cobain. ""No I don't Have a gun""?  What? this is really a dumb song. leave it to a group named Nirvana, whose leader shot himself. Blues Traveler, much better group. I wonder how many people have killed themselves because of Kurt Cobains death. That takes intelligence. Kurt's dead, life's not worth living. Why did I wait till the day before this is due to type it. Ohhhhhh I love this song. It reminds me of my boyfriend and I. ""When she says she loves me"". except I don't say I love him because according to every one of my friends I'm afraid to tell him I love him. Something about a fear of commitment and love. I guess it's all supposed to be Nathans fault, my ex, for cheating on me every day for a year and a half. oh well. "" When she says she loves me. say you love, but you don't speak love"". Good song. I wonder how many people actually think about the words of the songs they listen to. Oh yah, classic Sting. I have absolutely no idea what the name of this song is. I never really liked Sting anyway. I should really be doing my other homework. What do I have to do? English paper, read my classic civilization, read my English, study Psy notes, and phl notes. I guess I can do most of it tomorrow. Third Eye Blind. Where do they get names for these groups?  Tomorrow is another day{Go Scarlett}. I really don't want to go to work tomorrow. At least I have a decent boss for once, not some 57 year old pervert. what time is it? Wow 15 minutes really flies when your writing a paper that you can't possibly fail. I wish they were all that easy. Yah right. That probably wouldnt get me into Med School. Medical School, four more years of college. Hopefully I can get through these first four. I can do it, because Im good enough I'm strong enough, and dog-gon it, people like me. Well it's been a great 14 min. I'll be back at it tomorrow to do the other paper. I need to do these more than a day before their due next time. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am wondering whether or not I should try out for the dance team. In away I want to so I will have something to be a part of but at the same time I'm fearing the inevitable rejection. Rather than be rejected I'm just not going to try but then I'll always wonder whether or not I could have made it if I had tried. If I do try out and then I fail everybody will know that I FAILED AND I'll be embarrassed. I risked failure when I pledged but I did it anyway. My neighbor failed and I didn't think any less of her so why should I think any less of myself. I'll look fat in the leotard and tights, but one reason I want to do it is so I'll stay in shape. Everything is too competitive. I wonder what my cats doing since when you gave this assignment you mentioned a dos so I started to think about my cat. Then the picture frame I got today since I have a picture of my cat but I have to get another frame for my cat picture. My entire room is decorated in cat things. I found a gecko in my room today. There not have as big as the lizards we used to find in the house when I lived in Arizona. they used to be at least a foot long. I wonder what I'm going to do tomorrow I have reading to do in the morning. I can't help but put in capital letters at the beginning of sentences and periods. My mom wanted me to copy this and run spell check, how stupid. that what you get for having an English teacher for a mother. I want to get a calendar to put up all my things. Im scared to death I'll miss something like a homework assignment or test. I wonder if I need to be studying more often. It seems like I'm not doing enough. I don't know what I'll do if I fail. I hope I'm doing this write. It seems like the paper is just going on and on and on. I seem to worry about failure alot. I hate typing, I never memorized where the keys were so I keep goofing. My parents always told me to take typing but I was too lazy and afraid I was going to not get an A. I wonder how my sister got involved, society of women engineers. I say a bent today on the way to class. The other graduate students are coming on the 19 here. I bet it would be easier if I didn't repeat to myself what I was typing I need to go by the Newman center to meet n9ice boys. Why bother I never going to get married I probably not even going to get good grades and I'll never get in to med school and I'm going to flunk out. God I hope not or I'll end up as a house wife not that that's bad but I always wanted a career and my sisters so successful. My parents would be so disappointed. Now I'm starting to sound negative like that survey said but I was much more optimistic in the survey I wonder if those ever prove anything or if people really lie to themselves when they're doing those even though they think they're being realistic this girl beside me took forever doing the survey. How much time do I have left? IS anybody even ever going to read this? Probably  that was why it was done on the internet that reminds me of the guy I sat next to in Chem. I hope he doesn't think that I was offended by his remark it doesn't bother me I'm used to it with Adam and all. I feel like I've typed forever and it looks like nothing on this sheet the way it goes to infinity on the right. I keep on thinking about what to type instead of just typing what I'm think I just its just a habit from writing so many in class essays and such I'm so happy I passed the AP that way I don't have to take any English classes and I showed Mr. Cody and my mother I wonder what Patrick's doing. He got a 5. The girl at dinner the other night was so stupid she thought she got a 560 and the SAT's and the AP's were the same thing that's why I'm not a pom that and the fact I'm not talented enough since I spent a lot of high school studying instead of dancing or anything else. I can't imagine having three hours of practice a day. I guess I had as much with games and all but it seems like a lot less. I had a ton of fun at games though and wouldn't have given it up for it now. That's how I tell whether or not it was worth it if I would trade it for something else now not that I could go back and repeat it so I guess it doesn't matter anyway.   "
Tell me about yourself.,"well here I am sitting in front of this glowing monitor trying not to tell the editor in my head overtake me. It's more difficult than it seems but I must keep trodding. Shoot. I just realized I missed a club meeting tonight. I also remembered about the informal classes Ill be taking Monday. I should also be practicing guitar but I'm too lazy. (Homework for that matter)  Boy it's something else being 27 stories up. People look like small ants moving around in the strangest fashion. Now I don't even know what I'm saying anymore. I feel sick from the food I ate for dinner, and it's inhibiting me from my studies. What else to say. . . . . I remembered I should call Peggy since she left a message the other day, but that can wait till later. Oh, and Rob, well I need to inform him about the Houston concert info. I wonder if those airline tickets to D. C. came in yet. And where are those items I ordered from the catalog?  I'm beginning to worry. I cant believe B of A charges a dollar to merely check a statement from an ATM. They also charge for depositing and withdrawing currency from the bank teller instead of an ATM. outrageous. I'm really looking forward to go back home soon. I'm still homesick, but it's fizzled somewhat since the first few days. Looking at my bookshelf, it reminds that I bought Contact by Carl Sagan, which I keep intending to read, but never get around to it. I hate that. Why did I buy the book?  Well I thought Contact was an excellent movie for the moral implications that are brought up. It's a great thing to see such a science oriented film focus on faith and not mere facts. Carl Sagan must have been a brilliant man. My next door neighbors just turned up the stereo, so there goes the silence. Hmm what song is that?. Oh yeah, semi charmed life. I should look for those guitar tabs later. That reminds me, should go to the party next door on Sat. or not?  I suppose it couldnt hurt, but then I'd get further behind on my studies. How long have I been writing so far?  Hmm. almost 20 min. I haven't really said anything profound which disappoints me, but then again, this is a stream of consciousness assignment. I'm liking college a lot. It gives me space ponder and let my mind wander. It's amazing the places one can go if you just set your mind free. I don't know why, but sometimes I have an impulsive urge to write poems or songs, but once I get distracted from that sudden drive, I lose the will to do so. I guess I have to be in a certain mood. I noticed that I had mere frequent occurrences when I first got here. Perhaps it was due to the seclusion and sudden separation from friends and family. Being in a strange environment w/o a guardian is harder than I thought. I feel like I'm being forced to grow up faster than I'd like to. But I suppose it builds character, and I have never been one to back down from obstacles. Think of it as a gateway to another world. Hmm time's up. My train of thought has sure been a wacky one. Bunch of random thoughts strewn together.  does this represent a part of who I am?  certainly, but not hardly. maybe a paradox of some sort. one thought to add is that I have been such a weak willed person lately. I have those intentions, but I cant seem to get them to take root. That needs to change, and I guess I do notice a little improvement, but near as much as I'd like  "
Tell me about yourself.,"This blank screen is staring at me and my fingers are moving in my peripheral vision and this screen is so retarded. I wonder why I put 3 dots at the end of that sentence and who made that up anyway. my shoulders are getting sore-I probably shouldn't type with my arms straight out like this. I wonder if that helps combat carpal tunnel syndrome-ok, Im going to scoot up. I can't believe its Sat at 700 PM and I'm writing this. I'm such a nerd. actually I'm not. ,. I'm cool--but that's all relative I guess. Im really into drinking my coffee and Im staring at my green porcelain coffee cup with its drip coffee stains already on the side from where my lips have been. steam is rising out of the top and I really want to pick it up and have a sip of it but then this writing isn't continuous is it?  Jewel is playing in the background volume 5 and she's kind of distracting. here comes foolish games. I can totally relate. I wonder if Scott is thinking about me right now--I hope he's not the T. A for this class. This is so incredibly weird. I think I like him but Im not sure. he reminds me of Scott wolf and I can't stand him is that a bad sign?   I like Richard's accent too. wow English accents are really cute. Like in London. all of the guys were so amazing. especially that one in the subway that looked like Gavin Rossdale but he was speaking Italian so I doubt it was him. I wonder How Liz is doing?  And Michelle?  Why isn't Ken calling me?  I hate it when guys ask for your number and then never ever call you back. or else they wait a really long time to do it. Kind of like max. I wonder how he's doing I wonder about his dumb model sister in Paris. whatever. I love Jewel. I want to play piano right now even though I haven't played in six years. my gosh it's 7 :20 already and this is pretty fun. I should probably get a diary and do this in it but then what if someone reads it and thinks I'm a rambling idiot?  I have an ache in my heart about the council. I wonder why my name isn't on the list?  I swear, my application was the best one out of all of them. They are so retarded. Maybe it was too sweet and idealistic. maybe they think I'm full of crap and Making it up. but I really think that way. Maybe it's cause I was listening to Jewel at the time,. I wonder when my roommates are getting home  they are so active. of course they didn't have to get up at 700am this morning for crew tryouts. Ok, I probably didn't make it cause those chicks are total hosses. I have a lot of respect for those girls on the team. I wonder if St4eve will get back to me on being the coxin. I have no idea how to spell that word. my tongue is dry and why did I staple Scotts number to an orange sticky note so it's staring right back at me?  He writes like such a guy. My walls are so bare. and the st4reaks of light from the blinds are coming in golden. I wish I could write songs like Jewel. I want to play the guitar well too. I miss my Dad. he's staring back at me from my wall and he looks kinda sideways and I wonder why I returned that dress. this screen is so confusing I lose my place my toe hurts and I feel full. My wrap was gross though. I can't believe they didn't take my CDs--theyre so retarded. My tailbone hurts and I hope I'm not sore tomorrow Steve was a bit extreme. I keep hitting the wrong keys I really need to get to the container store and get some hangers but I know I need to do my homework. I hate calculus homework. Im dreading it. I wonder why Im so down and pessimistic today?  I'm usually not. Oh--gosh, I've got so much stuff to do and organize and my thirty minutes is about done. I wonder if I typed more than other people did and I wonder if a TA. actually reads all this crap and how he grades it?  weird. Maybe I should play my guitar. "
Tell me about yourself.,"The lights  are all out here in Hardin House. Thank goodness Amy has  this lap top so I can do this assignment. I still have to do the other one too. They both are due Friday. The lights just came on. I'm so relieved because now I can feel the air conditioning. I'm a little bit off the assignment because Cara is watching me. Cara says hi. she is really sick right now and her nose is always runny. she snotted on my bed. or maybe she just drooled. I don't really know. Tonight I need to go to the theta house and study. We have to get certain amount of hours done . I don't really want to read anymore of the Great Plains by Webb. It is like a history book. It  makes me want to fall asleep sometimes when I read it. The most interesting section was about the animals on the Plains. The little jackrabbit has a white patch on its butt so that whenever it is in danger or something it flares it up to communicate with it's own kind. I guess that's how it works. Right now it's talking about the north vs. the south and it is way boring. I have about 70 pages  to read tonight. It is a little overwhelming. sometimes I get behind  and feel real guilty about it because I want to keep up with all my classes. I need to do my math homework too. I kind of just feel like taking a nap until we go study but then I'll never get up. My bed is sooooooo  cozy. I just put on some pink sheets and they rock because they are soo soft. I kind of feel like watching Backdraft. Whichever Baldwin guy is in it is really good looking. He reminds me of this Stratford guy that is living in  towers. He is really good looking obviously and really sweet too. He walked us home the other night from the KA house because he thought it was too dangerous. then he started talking about what church he went to. I was thinking this guy is too good to be true. But then someone told me that he had just broken up with his long time girlfriend because they are at separate colleges. I don't think I would like to get in the middle of that. If that's the only reason why they broke up then that's not enough. Because obviously they had something big to hold onto and not let go of just like that. But he is one of the better guys  I've seen around lately. I kind of want to just ver out tonight but I know that I'll feel bad about it later. I'm so into making good grades but I haven't quite gotten into the hang of doing homework in this new setting and everything. Danielle just called. I'll be living with her next year. I think itll be good. Me , Cara, Allison, and Danielle. I don't really know her too too well. Seh and Allison are friends. Cara, Allison, and I have been hanging out a lot lately. She's so cool. It's really awesome to get to know people from different states and become close friends. She's from Oklahoma. Oklahoma is so random. What is in Oklahoma?  Maybe we'll all go there to see her family sometime. We might go to Houston for The Rice game. Then I'll get to see my little brother. He is so cool. He's growing like a weed right now. It's crazy. Now that I'm gone he is like an only child. I hate that for him. Maybe he likes it a little. He gets all the attention now. I don't want to lose the awesome brother/sister relationship  that  we have right now because I'm 3 hours from home. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I suppose we all get caught up in a web our first year. I wonder sometimes if it is going to be too much for me to handle. I guess everyone feels the way I do. People sure make me feel that they are smarter than me though. I should do well. Why not, I have just as much potential as the next person. This person sitting  next to me now is making me tense. I wonder why. Come on Chris, your a Drama  major, your not suppose to feel nervous. I feel better now that she left though. Man some of these people really type fast. I don't even hear any pauses. Great, another victim sitting next to me. I suppose we are all victims though. I wonder what everyone else wrote on this paper. It feels a little odd. Seems kind of like my mind just rambles on. I guess everyone's does though. I really need to speed up my typing. I used to be so quick. I really have a lot of stuff to do today. Man I miss my best friends. I miss Kelly even though I hate to admit it. It seems like I tell her that more than I tell anyone else. Maybe she is the same way. I know she probably is making up some reason why I don't love her anymore. She is just whiny like that. I wish she wasn't so negative. I'm always going to love her. Too bad she is in Dallas. Ok, somebody turn on the air in here. It is  getting a little warm. I wonder what Bret and Brian are up to. I know Courtney is mad at me but I only wish she knew the way Chad really is. I mean, it is not like I'm the only one telling her to watch out. Ten minutes to go, or is it five? Oh well, I'll just keep pecking at the keys. I really don't want to go to class today. I don't know how people can skip though. That is all I need is to get  behind on all my work. I still have another one of these things to write tomorrow. My classes are cool though. I shouldn't panic too much. Come on, I'm only taking 12 hours. But then, I am just a fish. I'm sure most people feel the same way. I know Micah does. I wonder if he ever goes out and does anything. I'm really surprised that he came to Mihir's party with us. Ahhh, he had a good time. This  city is definitely not Dallas. I hate to admit it, but, I think I like it better  there. I wonder who I will end up together with. I'm lonely but yet I don't think that I want anything serious. Oh what do I know?  12:01, I think I have 4 more  minutes. Whoever is reading this probably thinks I'm nuts. I wonder if someone really is going to read all of this since there is so many students. Wow, the typing is getting better. It is funny what a little practice will do. I wonder if they have a word processor down here. Why does everything have to be online. It might not be so bad if I could get mine to work. I wonder what I am going to do. Oh  well. Yea, finally through. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Last night I had another fight with my mother. Maybe it was not such a good idea to stay home for my first year of college. As far as I can see I have only brought her pain and no comfort. Although she does make several good points about my  unorthodox behavior, ultimately I am a grown man. If I told my friends that she tries to make me come home at a certain time  the result would be ridiculous. Not that opinions and thought of my buddies would really sway my mind, but many of them respect me for where I came from and what I have done. I've got a good job(insurance company $7. 80/hour), pay for my car, attend college,  help my mom at her beauty salon, and still have time to go out and party with them. My mother thinks that my constant ventures  to places she has never been will bring about my demise. Certainly there is no way I can deny about her role in my life. She has always been there for me and lately we have grown even closer, but I dont see how she can try and write my schedule out for me  according to her opinions. Recently our dog had 7 puppies and she spent much of the time caring for them and taking them to the vet. Six of the puppies have been sold, and the one that is left originally belonged to the mail dog's owner who changed their mind about  keeping it. so my mom blames me for not cleaning up after the puppy I dont even want. I tell her to give it away and then she  blames for being a cruel person in that we dont know what kind of person would get it. For a while now I have been looking for a female. And I dont mean just any ol' girl I can get plenty of those. But a lady who I won't get tired of after the first night in bed. There is  several ladies out there who I would like to be with, but for some reason it never turns out to be the way I thought. So I just go on  with flirting' around. Most girls I know think that I except something from them, but I'm simply trying to be friends. I guess thats  the rep I got at Anderson high. Maybe because of the people I hang with. Hopefully I've written enough, and if not here are some more  of my thoughts for the prof to analyze. In college I've tried to have different study habits then high school. In high school I could do  nearly nothing and still maintain a high average. Here I know this can not be done. this of course another concern of my mother. I can not dismiss actual reading and studying as not important at the university of Texas or I might end up with a poor man working for McDonaldss or begging for money on the drag. A few days ago I read (in the psychology book) that in order for your mind  to expand you must exercise it like a muscle. Interesting idea.              "
Tell me about yourself.,"okay well I have 20 minutes to write this paper well isn't that exciting. I believe Im the worst speller and typer in the world. it seems like this is a really long page anyway I just wrote to my friend marissa who goes to southwest and I was going to write my friend Jamie who I meet this summer at work but I was stupid and didn't get her email address of the letter she sent me and erased so now I can't write her, she probably thinks Im the biggest bitch right now . I wonder if you all actually read these and analyze them . I want to go into criminal psychology because I think it sounds very interesting and believe it would be good for me when I try and get into the FBI I hope I can get into it. what if they turn me down. then Ill have worked all these years for it and gotten nothing from it . I think I will get in though . You know what I hate is when your hands get on the wrong keys on the key board and if your not watching you can write three sentence all messed up because of one little misplacement of the hand . I really hope you all don't read these because mine is kind of silly. anyway I slept for a long time today and I still feel tired I think if you sleep to much it makes you more tired, that's just my theory. It seems like I've been at this computer for ever because the note I wrote to my friend Marissa was really long and Im not that fast of a writer. When you stare at I computer screen real long it seems like your in a trance just like when you watch t. v. you just totally can veg out. a girl just poked her head in the door. Im down in the computer lab right now because I don't have a computer and the one my room mate has doesn't have the Ethernet set and she's hooked up to America on-line so I can't use my password to log on so I have to come down here. I really want a t. v. in my room. I know it is such a trivial thing but sometimes it's just nice to come home and relax and watch some t. v. Noelle said she was going to get one before we came down but now she doesn't want to spend the money on it and my parents and I don't have the money so we are just stuck with out a t. v. It's okay though I'm sure it's better for me. the only thing is I don't know when anything is going on . I need to find out about the ani dafranco concert for Jacob I just don't know who to ask or where to look. anyway about the t. v. I don't get a newspaper and the daily Texan doesn't tell you every thing that's going on around the world. so a t. v. would be helpful so I could watch the news. well my mind just went blank and I have nothing to talk about. I love to people watch ,  it's cool to see the way different people act. That's why I think psychology would be interesting. I like to know how people tick. I hope me and Shawnee stay best friends through out the year because I really want her to move down here next year, but when I went home last weekend I don't know if she had fun with me or not. oh well I won't worry about because what ever happens will happen. Im sure it will all work out for the best what ever it is. my 20 minutes is up now so Im going back to my room . so long. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well I'm finally getting around doing the writing assignment, I'm feeling  relieved. I thought that for some reason I would not have the time to do  it, actually not get around to doing this assignment. I don't know the  reason behind that worry. hmmm. what do I write?  well I'm getting  tired already and I'm thinking will I be able to stay awake for thirty  minutes to type all this??? I hope so. well I'm thinking about my classes  and panic is setting in. I'm worried. I'm falling behind with reading  material in my courses and not . my mind has moved to something else. THE MCAT. I realized that I had to take it this spring so Im getting  really nervous about it. I'm getting nervous now thinking about it. well  my eyes feel really tired. I want to sleep. I still feel nervous and anxiety towards this semester/the mcat/medical  schools/exams. I usually don't feel this nervous but since this year  counts so much with medical schools I feel that top performance is . what's a good word?  ummm. My mind is drawing a blank. essential?   well good enough. I feel I must perform beyond my own goals. hmm. well I don't really agree with that statement. I just feel I need to  do good. I need to be satisfied. Hopefully get a 4. 0 this semester. what else?  I'm thinking what else I should write about? It's quiet in here. the fan is turned on. BUT its a Huntington. or bay  something. let me  see if I remember?? NOPE I sure don't. Well I didn't exercise today,  which explain why I'm soo tired. I love running it gives me so much energy and makes me feel great. I love working out, but nowadays I dont have much  time b/c I live off campus and commuting and parking takes too much time  that I just run at home sometimes, if I find a running buddy. the  nervousness is gone, but it left a massive headache. massive, I like that  word its sounds so cute  when English people say it with their English accents. I'm worried. again. actually I'm thinking about my teacher recommendations  which is getting me worried. so I'm worrying myself now. too much of this  is not too good. I knew a girl who used to give herself ulcers,, I'm  wondering if it was psychological?  well,, probably there was some  psychological reason. woow,, I'm so happy I'm taking this course. its soo cool. I'm really tired. and bored now. yet I feel indifferent. as I was saying I think psychology is soo interesting. it seems really cool. The lectures are awesome. I'm happy. until the  first round of tests. curiosity and anxiety well not really I'm kind of curious . I'm thinking about my friend. old roomie. shes in the corps at a&m and I'm  worried about her. I wish she would quit because they are so ridiculous. their little rules are ridiculous. when people have to pee in their sinks  because its easier to do than go to the bathroom that's when you have to  worry. I'm still worried. she's a good person. but that the path she  chose for herself. Im hoping this will make me feel better. its working  I feel better now. but I'm still worried not so much upset,,, I wonder  how long I've been typ8ing?  I hope long enough let me take a peek at my  watch. YUP!!! yes! its been 30 minutes I'm not sure if I did this right. I sure hope so. I'm getting sleep and I still have a ton of work to do. I think I'll sleep my brain needs to replenish the exhausted brain cells. well I guess I'll end this now and go to bed. One thing I noticed is that  I was kinda indifferent not too emotional all through this because of my  fatigue. well . good night. and sweet dreams. and as my old roommate  would say. "" don't let the bed bugs bite"". I hope she pulls through. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Hello you wonderful people who are reading my paper. I hope you really really  enjoy this one after all the other ones you have read. Anyway right now I am  really excited because I'm just about to go to the Rage Against the Machine concert. I'm hoping that I have a blast and I know I will. My brother and a  lot of my friends came up for this concert. So, I will be able to see them. AIN'T THAT THE GREATEST THING. Earlier today, I was wishing that I could fly. The reason for that is that we  were stuck in traffic. Just think about it, just flying through the air, your hair flying back, brushing across your face--but I guess if we could fly, we  wouldn't think that much about it. Yesterday, I got an e-mail from my sister. It was really COOL and all, and she should come visit me soon. My sister is the one person in my family that I  really enjoy--but enough about that. I'm going to a concert, and to party!    Oh, just to throw something in here. I was noticing that many people here get  really excited about going out and staying out till whatever time in the  morning. I think this is really hilarious because I come from Laredo, Texas. That is a border-town to Mexico (not that it could be Canada in Texas). Well,  we have clubs and discos in Mexico that are just a few minutes away so I'm  use to going out, staying out late, and drinking. Therefore, I came to the conclusion that most of the people here have not been able to go out and have  fun during their high school years--whether this is attributed to their parents or themselves. That is why there is such a high drop-out rate here in UT, and why a lot of students struggle just to pass.  I hope pass all my classes with A's if possible. I'm planning to be a plastic  and reconstructive surgeon, and I kind of need a great GPA to get into Med  School. Oh by the way, I want to clear up the reason why I want to be that  kind of a surgeon. Many people believe that plastic surgeons are doctors who are just in the business for money. Some people don't even consider doctors as real doctors. They are seen as individuals who help superficial people stay  young and beautiful. Although plastic surgeons may do this, they help build up the self-esteem of the patient. There are some people who were born with  defects or were in a really bad accident, plastic/reconstructive surgeons help these people enter the world again. Most people with some type of defect  usually have a low self-esteem. Therefore, they do not really enjoy life nor do they participate in daily activities with other people. Plastic/reconstructive surgeons allow these people to enter into the world. They feel better about  themselves and as a whole their spiritual self is improved. This is vital to  the survival of the individual--for without it there is nothing to live for. Well, I'm going now hope I didn't bore you too much!  :>                                                                                            "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm at home right now. it's weird because I don't really live here anymore  sine my new home is at UT. 'm glad I got to come and see my dog and my cats. they miss me alot. I love my sister. she already says she wants to be a d-g  and she knows nothing about it but that her big sis is one. I have so much  to do that it's crazy. I feel like no mater what I do there's always something  else to do. I am sooooooo excited about Friday. my ex-boyfriend is diving down  from tech to see me. it's been over a month since Ive seen him. I can't  decide what to do about him. we get along great. he can treat me well, when  he doesn't he doesn't do it on purpose. I know that this sounds pathetic but  it's not. Im confused because I want us to get back together this weekend but I also want to just be friends. it's just that I love him so much and could see myself married to him. I know that he loves me. he said that he wanted us to get back together, but we'll see what happens. it's amazing how the boy is  always on my mind. I mean, the more I try to stop, the worse it gets. I guess that's how you know that you're in love. ok, it's been ten minutes and I still  have ten to go. yeah, not. I hate to write. I hate that I had to take freshman English because I got at 600 instead of a 610 on my sat2. dumb. the class will be  easy though. I like college life. the only class Im scared of is calculus. I was supposed to take it in high school but was busy with dance and pals so I didn't take it. big mistake. Ive forgotten so much stuff since junior year. my lil sis is a big sophomore now. she still seems so young to me. my parents went to the airport to get my older bro. he's the perfect son-national merit scholar, works for my dad, etc. the cowboys won today. I was exited. Josh, my ex, and I used to bet on the cowboy games. this reminds me to copy that e-mail he wrote. he was fighting with this other guy over me. how romantic. I miss him alot. Im so glad I get to see him this weekend. I know that this is materialistic, but Im worried about what to wear. I have this effect on him that he can't resist me(I know it sounds like I have an ego, but he has the same effect on me which makes it so hard) it was easy when Id see him every day because it made him want to be with me. but Im worried now that he's  away, he'll forget about his woman in Austin. but whatever's mean to be will be. Im very religious, but today I didn't go to church. it's hard to find time in college. excuses, excuses. I need to go by and oil-absorbing mask. my oily skin is gross. well, Id love to sit here and type some more, but my time is about up and I have to go to the store before my parents and brother get home for family hamburgers night. I can't decide if Im going home to UT tonight or not. I think I might just stay here but I can't decide. hope that my  mind helps you in this experiment or whatever this is. I can't to learn about all this mind stuff. it looks coll. well, bye for now. ps- I feel like I  just wrote a long e-mail to a friend. maybe that's what Ill do now. "
Tell me about yourself.,"  So far I have been at UT for I guess 6 school days, and I can already feel myself slipping. School was so much simpler in middle and elementary school. Why can't I go back?  Lets see. what did I do today?  I woke up around 2 (we have lives around here), and  was bugging my sister to take me to church. I haven't been there since I don't know how long, but I need to start going again. my ex-boyfriend called and I don't know how it made me feel. I want to be free of him and not have to deal with any of his problems. I don't want to desert him, but I don't know what he wants from me and what I can possibly do for him. it wasn't a really serious relationship and to tell the truth I have no idea what I was thinking when I went out with him. he's not my type at all and my parents would be so disappointed if they found out. thank goodness it's over already. I don't know how I feel about him. I would like to be his friend, but that's it, and I also don't know what he wants. isn't this depressing?  Guys. Don't they all suck?  I wrote my would-have-been-boyfriend in high school and for some silly reason I am still waiting for him to reply. I don't know what's wrong with me. Maybe things will work out in the next ten years or so. I get really tired and depressed when I think about my ex and I don't know what to do about it. I want to be his friend, but I know he wants more and I don't think I can offer him that. I need to ask him what he wants or rather expects from me. He comes from a broken home and has a LOT of problems that I don't want to deal with. He's from Port Arthur and asked me to come down for his birthday. Funny I was actually considering it. what's wrong with me?  I called my little sister (12 yrs. old) and she wasn't home. Neither were my parents. I think they are at my aunt's house eating as usual. they live in new orleans and I miss them a lot. I need to come back and visit and I don't think I can do that until Christmas vacation. that sounds a lot better than Christmas  break. It really bothers me that I didn't capitalize most of the words that should be capitalize, but I shouldn't be worried about that right?  I am so unenergized right now. I need to go jogging or something, but it is late. I can't believe Princess Diana died. Mother Teresa also died, yet she didn't get as much attention as Princess Di. So much has happened in my short 17 years life span. I can actually tell my kids that I was alive when Princess Di and Mother Teresa died. it seems as if everyone is dying. isn't that sad?  I just found out that an acquaintance of mines is pregnant again. I don't know how to feel. this isn't her first pregnancy and she should know better. what is this world coming to?  my cousin is going through a break up right now and I don't know what I can do to help. I know she can do better than him, but I also know that she likes him a lot. What's a girl to do?  I am really relieved that I don't have a boyfriend anymore, yet why am I still commenting on that?  I was a lot better before he called. I just wish he could disappear and I don't know. he really needs to straighten out his life. you know what the funny thing is?  I think that the bad guys are the guys that like you more. it may not be true, but when it is, it is. let my rephrase that. when a guy that's on the wrong side falls (for you), they fall hard. I don't know if anyone has fallen for me yet. it is midnight and I still have other things to do. thank goodness I remembered about this. I actually don't mind typing like this. this is just like one of my journal pages that I try to do at least twice a week. I really believe that it serves as a stress reliever and should be done more often. well it's been 35 minutes so Im outta here. lan ngoc ngo       "
Tell me about yourself.,"  It surely was a good day today. I found all my classes without any difficulty. I have been at this school for four days now. And today is the first day that I  didn't lose my way to the classrooms. Anyway, I don't particularly like this school, but this is the best business school which is near my home, and my mom doesn't want me to leave the state. I was hoping that I could have a math major at MIT, but again family argued that it would be so hard to find a job and to have good pay if I had  math as my major. As a Chinese, I would have to follow their tradition that to obey parents. I know that it probably will sound strange to you, or many other Americans. But it just the way it is. God help me!  Gratefully, I am always a positive person  who usually challenges the changing world with unchangeable doings. I might be somewhat  too confident sometimes. I enjoy my confidence though. I always enjoy to look at the world from the bright side. I know that there certainly are something ugly, but I  think that people don't have to be so critical. If everyone takes good care of himself or herself, be more open-minded, more self-controlled, and more concerned for the good  of the society as a whole, then our world will be much brighter, much more beautiful, and much more peaceful. I believe that before we watch out for the others, we should first watch out for ourselves; before we try to change others, change ourselves first. Before I complain the shortcomings of others, I try to check with myself that if I have the shortcoming too. This practice requires a peaceful and logical mind. So keep cool! (Not only the outside, but also the inside. )  Thinking through the past and the future,  specially after I finished my pretest on this class, I become more and more grateful that  my parents taught me to be what I am now. The skill to cheer myself up no mater how bad the situation become is really helpful. I believe that as human beings our biggest challenge in life is to overcome ourselves. No one can ever make you cry without your permission. Choices are always ours!      I guess I have been writing for over 20 minutes by now. Hopefully this assignment is well done. Hope your have a good day.                                                            Sincerely,                                                           Linda (Da) Li        "
Tell me about yourself.,"I really want to go swimming but I don't want to tell Sylvia that I don't want to see her dumb brother play in that stupid baseball game. I really want to go home this weekend. I know for a fact that my mom would never let me go well maybe she would let me go out with Gera even after I haven't seen her for a while. Maybe I just don't want to go out with him I think that I feel guilty for some strange reason and I can't get the courage to tell Gera. This air conditioner is really bothering me. It makes so much noise and does not cool very much. I am so hungry. My roommate sucks. I don't know why I'm so mean. Maybe I'm just not used to someone always wanting to know everything I do. Maybe she's just too smart and I feel stupid. I'm really hungry. I don't know how I'm going to get to eat if I go with Sylvia and Loni. I wonder if Gera is calling me right at this moment. I wonder how come his dad didn't say goodbye before hanging up. I think I'm  making too much noise typing. I get the feeling that I'm disturbing everyone behind me. I can't believe Loni. She just met this guy today and she already has him in her room. I wonder if her parents know the way she is. I still have one more question to do for Economics and I don't really feel like reading. I learned that I should wait to be told what to read before I stress That stress test Sylvia and I took was weird. I think that man thought that my life was pretty boring. I bet he thought I was weird. He could right away tell what was bothering Sylvia. I know that Manny really has Sylvia thinking about him day and night. He's such a jerk. I can't believe what How could someone treat someone that way. Maybe love is blind. I wonder why people around here are so free. I can't believe that girl I say two days ago. She was wearing next to nothing and felt no shame. I assume she must have felt fresh or something but doesn't she have one bit of self respect for herself. I wonder why the lady behind me just apologized to the girl. I had to turn around for a second. I think that I'm a nosy person. I often catch myself eavesdropping on other people's conversations. During lunch today I listened to two complete conversations. I could not believe the things that people talk about. Why does my roommate have to be so selfish. I think that I want to make everyone healthy. I don't know why but I am so self conscience of the way I look. But I hear that is actually average in girls my age. I went all out on this diet until I lost up to 25 pounds and now I think that I am too skinny. but I say this girl today that was a bit over weight and she was beautiful, then why do I gross myself out when I see my roommate eating horrible and then I see her change and I feel that I have to go workout. She gets offended very easily. I don't even tell her anything about her weight or anything related to that subject anyway and she jumps up and becomes aggravated very quickly. "
Tell me about yourself.,"IF I COULD ACTUALLY PLAY IN MAJOR TOURNAMENTS LIKE THE US OPEN, THE FRENCH OPEN, THE AUSTRILIA OPEN, ETC. EVEN IF JUST ONE TOURNAMENT, I WILL BE SO GREATFUL. AS I CONTAINUED WATCH THESE PROS PLAY, I PUSH MYSELF IN WORKING MY WAY UP THERE;I PRACTICE AS MUCH AS I CAN,I TRY TO LEARN AS MUCH AS I CAN, FROM THEIR MENTAL PART TO THEIR TECHNIQUES; ALTHOUGH IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE THAT I WILL EVER  BECOME AS GOOD AS THEY ARE. YET, I NEVER GIVE UP MY DREAM OF ACTUALLY PLAYING IN ONE OF THE MAJOR TOURNAMENTS BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT DREAMS DO COME TRUE IF I WORK HARD FOR IT. IF THIS DREAM NEVER COME TRUE I WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED AT MYSELF, AT LEAST THERE ARE GREAT MEMORIES LEFT IN ME. THERE ARE OTHER DREAMS AND MISSIONS I HAVE PLANNED TO WORK FOR, NOW AND IN THE FUTURE, AND I WILL ALWAYS BE POSITIVE IN EVERY DREAMS I HAVE AND IN WHATEVER I DO.  "
Tell me about yourself.,"My roommate is trying to ask me what we are going to do while I'm typing this. We played basketball for about two and a half hours. For some reason I played pretty good today, I usually don't play that good. I'm not really sure what to write, well I mean type. I went to a sorority date dash last night. It was pretty fun. They rented out some club on sixth street. I saw some people that I went to highschool with, and I didn't get home until about three so I'm really tired . I really doubt that I'll stay out that late tonight. Tomorrow I'm going to san Antonio for the beastie boys concert with these girls that I don't really know that well. I hope everyone has a good time. The next day is my grandpa's birthday and my entire family is going to meet at our ranch in Gonzales. That reminds me I have to get him a gift. I'll get him something from ut of course probably a hat or something. My suitemates went home this weekend, one lives in Arlington the other lives in deer Park. they are pretty cool guys. Sometimes they get on my nerves but I'm sure I get on people's nerves too. My roommate is going to a church thing right now. He said that the people there are really nice but they are extremist about how they worship, I think it makes him feel uncomfortable, I can relate I've been to some church functions like that. But he is also going because he met some girl there so he is getting the best of both worlds learning about god and hooking up with a girl. I WISH I COULD OF GONE. I can hear my neighbors radio through my wall incase you wanted to know. It kind of makes me want to turn mine on since my time with you is up. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I still need to do my homework for Spanish. I'll be spending a lot of time in this building in the spring because I'll be back in design and vis comm. I'm getting hungry. tonight Amy Alex and I are going to get pizza. Alex and I weren't getting along too well for a while. it was because I have been dating and spending less time with him. for a long time it was always just the two of us, neither one dating. now that I am it bothered him just a little bit. oh well, we talked about it and he's better now. which is good, I don't like to fight with Alex. I have a lot to do this week, tonight I need to read and I would like to work on and ,ideally, finish my calculus homework. tomorrow I am going to apply for a job at the nature company in the mall. I talked to one of the managers this weekend at the forum and he said that they were hiring. that would be a good place to work, at least I like the store. we'll see. I guess I need to call my sister tonight she always gets all worked up if I don't talk to her once a week. I just talked to her the other day though, sometimes I just don't feel like talking to her. I hope that someday she'll stop trying to mother me. I hope that now that she has a child she will let me be. I actually sort of enjoy my calculus class. this is my first time to take calculus so I didn't know what to expect. it is pretty interesting. I'm really getting hungry and it s going to be a couple of hours before I get to eat dinner I wish my computer at home worked it is so annoying that the computer people are being so stubborn about fixing it. I 'm glad uncle mike is going to help me with it. mom really did a good job when she picked uncle mike to be my financial adviser ii really care for hm a lot. it is always  amazing to me that it is usually your friends that you can count on more than your family. you always are expected to help your family whether you like them or not but your friends are chosen and they like you and want to help with things and they won't hold it over your head. unfortunately most of the people in my family are big fans of the guilt trip. I can't stand that sort of thing. "
Tell me about yourself.,I want to go to Mexico and dance I have not dance in a wile no time the is so much good live music here it because money though I am hopefully going to get a job I need to turn in that application tomorrow too I have a lot of stuff to do oh well I am going take it as it comes though bye. 
Tell me about yourself.,"My toes are kind of cold, no, they're very cold because this room is always frigid. At least I've got my flannel pants on that are so comfortable!  I love them. I could live in them. My T-shirt isn't too warm, but it's okay. I'm kind of wondering how I'm going to do this for 20 minutes straight. My thoughts kind of wander, but I'm not sure how I can record them for that long. I have a kind of upset feeling in my stomach right now. I think I'm just hungry. The rest of me is very relaxed because of the day I just spent out at Hamilton Pool, swimming and hiking. I loved the cold water that felt so good after the hot sun beating down on me in the car and during the hikes. The hikes were fun, though, because everything was so clean and clear, and it was fresh and refreshing. I wish my desk went back farther because I feel like the monitor is right in my face and it is too big for me to look at the whole thing. I would like a less-focused perspective on it, but I guess that's a dumb thing to say because it's nice to have a big monitor and it's not such a problem. People down the hall are getting kind of loud. It kind of annoys me when they talk really loud all over the dorm, but I guess it shouldn't because I could always just shut my door and it wouldn't be a problem. Plus, I know that I'm really loud a lot of the time, especially when friends come over and find my guitar, speaking of which, I need to get my guitar out of Dave's trunk so I can practice it because they're so much better than me at playing and if we're going to do music for the Happening, I need to be better. I'm wondering if I'm doing this assignment right. I mean, am I supposed to record what I think and feel right now, or if my mind wanders to tangents should I record that too?  I guess I'll just go with my stream of consciousness, like the assignment says. My fingers are going to get tired of typing. I feel like they are getting worn smooth by my fingers always tapping on them. I guess the real problem is that my fingers are cold so there is a kind of loss of sensation and they don't move so well right now. My fingers always get so cold during the winter, especially. I'm kind of dreading fall for that reason, but I love fall and winter, and I'm actually really excited about it. I wonder if I was reading this if I would think I am a negative person. I mean, the whole thing is about negative stuff: cold toes and fingers and stomach pains and annoying stuff going on around. I'm actually a really happy person, I don't know why I complain so much. I wonder if I do that in everyday conversation, too. I guess I'm kind of whiny, but I catch myself doing it so I stop-plus, people know that I'm not really serious about it, I just like to make noise sometimes. rrOoooh, I like popping my knuckles-there I go trying to be positive-it's funny that that's what I came up with to be positive. I just did it, and it helps them feel so much more movable, which is ironic because it'll probably give me arthritis and keep me from moving them when I get old. Oh well, it's a habit I can't seem to break. On my desk I have pictures of my cousins. They are so cute-the little ones, the older ones are just goofy and funny. I love them. Just looking at them makes me laugh about dumb stuff that we've done. There is also a picture of my little sister making a really silly face into the camera. She's in her bathing suit, wearing goggles and everything. Everybody laughs at that picture, including me. There is also pictures of a church retreat I did called Happening. I love those pictures because that was probably the best week of my life and those people are probably my best friends in the world-except for my family because family has always known me and will always be there. I'm so glad that I'm saved. I used to never use that phrase bc I thought it was cheesy and overzealous, but it's so true. Where would my life be without Christ?  I just don't know. He brings me so much joy that it's overwhelming. I wish I could share that with everyone who has never felt it, but some people don't want to hear it. that's too bad because I know people who need Christ (well, we all do, but I mean people who complain about a void in their life that they don't know how to fill) and they're the ones who I most want to tell about Him, but there is such an attitude in society that you just don't  ""preach"" to other people, and they would resent it if I tried to tell them. They don't realize that I just want to share-""I know it can do it for you-you've got to know what it did for me. "" (song lyrics) but I'm labeled as one who judges-funny thing is that they're the ones who are judging me. My intentions are pure. It's not like I'm on commission-one extra year in Heaven for every person you bring to Christ-I just care about people and the Lord, and I want to serve Him and help them. It's the truth, you know?  If only I could just tap my experience into people so they wouldn't doubt me or think I'm false or that I'm just trying to glorify myself because I'm not. ""What do I care about pleasing men?  If I wanted to please men, I would not be a servant of God. "" Gal 1:10 That's Reagan's favorite verse. Hmmm, I wonder if Reagan is back in town yet. He went home for his dad's birthday this weekend. I should call him tonight, and now my 20 minutes are up so I can do that!  wow, that went fast. it's kind of scary how fast that went! "
Tell me about yourself.,it has been raining for the past 4 days and I guess that has  a lot to do with everyone's attitudes. I feel a little relieved and tired though I had my first test of the semester this morning. I feel tired because I spent the majority part of the weekend partying rather then studying like I should have. now I was forced to cram study this morning just because of my laziness and inability to control my desires to go out with my friends. I should recover with a good nights sleep tonight. I called my father today. I'm trying to get on his good side now because he has been very disappointed in me. for some reason I seem to keep getting myself in situations that are to his beliefs not appropriate. the bad part about it is that I know that I am doing wrong but I still continue to do other things that make feel that he has failed as a parent. I guess he think is that if I am not perfect then he has failed as a parent. I'm trying to get it to him that I still have a lot of things going for me. I guess as a parent you want what's best for your child. so any little flaw on my part makes him feel that he did not do a good job raising me. I feel totally different though. I believe that I have thee best parents in the world because they have provided me with al the possible things to help me better myself in every way possible. in other matters work is going pretty well I will probably be getting a raise soon. my performance has been really well so maybe it will be a substantial raise            
Tell me about yourself.,"Last night I was almost done and my computer just shut off. I don't really understand why but oh well. I don't usually understand computer stuff, or any technical stuff in general. I hope that they have my packet today at the co-op so that I can be totally done with mis before tomorrow I think that I am pretty organized in relation to homework more organized than usual at least I think that Lucy will be a good academic influence on me since she is a good studier its so much different having a roommate that studies since angie didn't do much last year but it is a good thing may be finally I will get to go to sleep earlier and that will make me healthy I still can't believe that I didn't catch mono from angie last year I have a sore throat now I hope that it goes away soon I don't really want to have to go to the health center you never know when th3ey are going out have to take blood and that really freaks me out I can't believe that it is already time to start school again this summer went by so fast and rush was such a blur and we have had no time to recuperate before jumping back into school this semester is going out be really hard and busy I think I thin k all of my classes will be really interesting, but difficult I am so glad that I was able to get out of art history and into philosophy that will be a lot more interesting it is so weird how some teachers can teacher art history so differently so many people told me that they liked it and that it was easy but I know that that class wouldn't have been easy it was such a pain to add/drop though I am so glad that it is done next weekend is the first football game I am looking forward to it I am glad that billy and I got season tickets so that I don't have to go draw or anything it s so nice to have all of them now and especially the OU tickets I doubt that I will end up going to the a and m game  because I bet I will stay home for thanksgiving well, billy can invite one of this friends to go with him I can't believe that he wouldn't stay home for thanksgiving though that surprises me his mom is going to be very unhappy with him I am getting really hungry I wonder what we will do for dinner I wish that billy and I could get together but we are not on the best terms right now I can't believe that we got in such a big fight last night maybe we were just tired I hope that everything turns out okay it was nice of eric and Jeff to come over last night sometimes I miss having all those guys next door like last year we had a lot of fun last year together I am glad that Cindy and eric get to be together again, but I hope that they are prepared for what's ahead it will be hard for them to adjust out being together all the time especially when the stress from school really kicks in I am kind of getting a little homesick I am anxious to see Lauren's new car I can't believe that she is really turning sixteen I am really afraid for her to drive so I hope that mom and dad are taking her out a lot for a lot of good driving experience she really could use the practice I am anxious to see dads' new office space too I hope that he is a little less stressed I know that going out the party last night was probably pretty hard for him, but I am glad that Steve a. will be available to help him because he needs some new employees I know that mom is getting worried about him being so stressed all the time but I know that she really is glad that he is not going out Minneapolis a lot that was getting really old it was nice to see Meredith this weekend it is so weird being I'm the same city as her again I wish tat I could have gotten to see brad too, but he was busy my feelings were kind of hurt how he acted toward me at the party on Wednesday night, but I understand they both still seem pretty immature and I am kind of worried about Meredith and I hope that she is careful. I am glad that she found a date for the date dash I can't believe that they are all living on the same hall that is just a little too weird for me but that's pat for you I hope that they all have a fun year and I hope that we all keep in touch it was nice seeing Ashley this weekend too her room at the house is really nice I think that her sorority house is really nice also it is really big and it must be nice to have their own bathroom and not have to do the community thing I am glad that Lucy and I are going to go on a walk I could really use the exercise I am going to try to start aerobics tomorrow I really need too get back in shape I felt so good about myself last year when I was going to aerobics everyday I need to get back in that mode I don't think that I really lost that much weight this summer but things seem to be fitting better now. I seem to not be snacking as much as I did last year which is a very good thing I hope that the food at the sorority house gets better because it hasn't been very good lately but I think that it will get better I hope that billy calls me after he gets home from work he is working way too hard I guess that he won't work next weekend because he will be at the football game that's a good things maybe we can spend some qt together okay this is getting hard of more things to keep talking about I think that I might be repeating some of the same stuff over and over again I hat it that mom can 't really send packages to the apartment but I'm afraid that I would never get them since there is no real apartment address or anything I'm afraid that they would just leave it outside my door and then something might happen whit it I hope that Amy and Meredith had a good time with their boys this weekend I will go down later and see I have a lot of fun with them we are really similar in a lot of ways I am really glad that they are living at centennial too there are so many tridelts here it is a lot of fun I wonder where Lucy and I will walk too we need to somehow walk by the coop I hope that it is not too hot outside when I went out onto the balcony a couple minutes ago it was really hot I think that it will be fun to study out there once it gets a little cooler I am anxious for it to cool down it was so hot walking out class the other day especially to the art building I was so disgusting by the time I got back form class Mondays and Wednesdays are going to be long now that I go from one to five but Tuesdays and Thursdays will be pretty easy except this Tuesday I have that class from six to eight o'clock which really stinks I wonder why all the good shows start again I can't wait to see the friends season premier and 90210 I am so excited this year should be very good well I am going to stop this now it is now over 20 minutes   "
Tell me about yourself.,"Is there a reason?  These questions have been filling my mind often lately. When I talk to my friends about it they say that they have the same problem. Is this a problem that every young man encounters?  It kin of scary because maybe I'll never find out. Also, can I ever be satisfied. Whenever I gain something I find my self always wanting more. I am incomplete. I have pushed many limits and yet have found no real answers. Some say a man with out a purpose will drive himself insane. Maybe , a man with all the answers has no purpose.  "
Tell me about yourself.,"However, I feel I could be falling into a trap that could severely effect my grades. My roommate is a friend from high school and unfortunately for me he likes to stay out very late. I have early classes and it is starting to take a toll on me. It doesn't seem as if there is enough time in a day. I am looking forward to playing club volleyball here and I really enjoy the coach. Volleyball is by far my favorite sport. I need to start asking some girls I have met out on dates. I am enrolled in a dancing class with one of my girlfriends and I am having a lot of fun with it. My parents are coming up to see me tomorrow and will be bringing my bicycle with them. It is funny, I love my parents very much but I really don't miss them. I don't have a desire to go home any time soon. My suitemates are having friends stay the night and I hope that they will not be too noisy. After the football game tonight I think I will do some homework and go to bed. I am looking forward to this psychology class. I find it very interesting so far. I need to be sure to keep up in my reading. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I wish I had a car though, but I think that will bug me for a while because it'll probably be a while until I can afford one. But I will always get by, I know. Well it appears that laundry day is tomorrow, so I still have to wake up at 7 am even though I have no classes till three but then again that's probably why it's laundry day. Well I didn't get to talk to my girlfriend tonight because she was in class late, but at least she's at class. That's good because she needs to go to class as often as possible to pull up her GPA so maybe just maybe she can come to Austin and live somewhere around here. I wonder if whoever reads this will ever understand why people ramble. Anyway, I'll call her tomorrow to see how her first day at community college is. It's pretty nice in my appt right now, a cool 70 degrees which is nice after having to carry about 50 pounds of groceries up a hill and up a flight of stairs. Just kept on saying ""Can you feel that!"" to keep myself from stopping because once you stop you just might not be able to start again. I guess that's the focus to my whole life. Not sure if that's good or bad or what. Probably what got me in trouble last semester when I was half way thru the semester. Pretty crazy that I'm my worst enemy, but in a way, I guess that makes me my best friend (except for my girlfriend and real best friend of course) but if I didn't kick my own butt to do better who would?  So I just keep on chugging. I don't know why I'm so success driven?  Lord knows I'd like to be able to loosen up a bit and have some fun, but I never can seem to do that. Try alcohol to do that, but pretty sure my body didn't take too much of a liking to that. Oh well. I'll probably grow out of it (please please please). So enough of that, I hope the Aggies have lost against FSU because then I get to email my Ag friends and laugh. But then again that might not be the greatest idea if the Horns don't fair that well this year. Don't know what I'm listening to on the radio now. Oh yea ACDC!! Rock on! Anyway, I loved that Howard Stern movie, not quite sure why, but you almost have to love someone that pathetic. Movies, that's a topic. I love going to see movies. Just like the escape I guess. Thrillers are the best, not the goory (sp?) ones but like the one with Kevin Spacy Usual Suspects, that movie was great. Also, that Primal Fear was terrific, saving that line for the last was brilliant technique, and the acting superbe. I was getting all sorts of recommendations from the guy at blockbuster this past Friday (yes I was a pathetic party pooper but I did manage to do some socializing). Anyway I get these movies and come home. Now I'm already disappointed because I have this great new TV in my living room and no cable hookup to watch anything but Fox thru a lot of colored snow. So I figure I'll rent a movie, that has to get reception. But NOOOOOO, the VCR is goofed or something. It may have something to do with the tracking, but I don't have the tape anymore so I can't experiment. I'm usually very good which technical things. I knew everything about my first VCR before it came out of the box. But last Friday was definately not my day (triple low I've heard it called). But oh well, my friends liked my spaghetti and my (MOM's) sauce so that was good. Not a complete loss. Man I would hate to be the person trying to pick stuff out of this. So anyway, I have 5 minutes or so to type. I have a printer sitting next to me still in its box, and a vacuum cleaner in its box in the closet. Tell you anything about me?  Actually, I'm a pretty neat ship keeper; I do have a bit of a paperwork mess in my bedroom but the livingroom is quite presentable except of  course for a big big (like really large and at one time really heavy) TV box. But until the cable guy comes on Wed. , it'll probably stay there. I have to make sure that I can support my mother beginning this summer because I think she may need it at some point. Wish I had a godsent car that would work and then I could probably swing insurance payments and gas, but with car payments it'd be too much. Oh my, listening to Eye of the Tiger, how old is that?!?!?! So, maybe I should just go to sleep after writing this. I need to go see if I can to the pretesting for this class, but I tried before this and couldn't get it to load up. Something about the server being down. Well, such is life. I think I should do pretty good this semester, shooting for a 4. 0 again. Got to stay in head of my brother, we are so competitive, he's a yr behind me but transfered in with a bit more credit than I did, and with leaving mid-semester last yr, he's got a good chance to stay pretty close. Times up, bye now!!!  "
Tell me about yourself.,"Adjusting to the classes, increased freedom and increases in ""having a good time"" have all been fairly easy to get used to. Meeting new people has been exciting and the ""name game of trying"" to remember everyone I have met has been a challenge. This Labor Day weekend I saw the huge different between high school and college as I decided to take a road trip with three other friends to Galveston, a popular Labor Day hangout. I don't know if it was the college parties that made  the night we were there seem dull or just that several key things were missing that usually made the time memorable. Seeing my younger friends made me feel out of place, and talk of curfew violations almost made me laugh. One thing is for sure those times are over and  getting further away, but also new and improved times are ahead. This weekend has also showed me that I am a very patient person. My roommate Paul has shown this to me. Having my windshield broken, being almost evicted from our apartment and being irresponsible are just a few of my things my roommate has done this weekend. If I am still sane at the end of the year I think that I will be a stronger person, because of having to deal with Paul. I feel the classes are picking up as professors start talking about future exams. O, I almost forgot to mention my goals for this year (in no specific order)- get good grades (a 4. 0), not get fatter, stupider, not get into too much trouble and have a blast. Basically I hope to work hard and play hard. "
Tell me about yourself.,"like a paper boat that's filled with water and slowly sinking. I'm not sure how to describe my thoughts at this particular moment. My thoughts seem to roam from one thing to another in a split second without me actually aborting all the information. I guess what to say is that my thoughts are unorganized like my backpack, all scattered around in bits. What pops up in my mind as a thought is how I'm going to go home after my classes are over for the day and check off the things that I remembered to do and those that I forgot to do. In my mind, all that I can see is my thoughts as a candy and it being surrounded by a mob of ants. My feelings at this moments are being jumpy and nervous at anything I see. I can't seem to calm myself. I also feel out of place and not all there, really unprepared. I guess to say is that I feel like I'm on a roller coaster ride and all alone on it. My sensations are at this moment very glad that the day is almost over and excited about hurrying home. My sensation at this moment also indicate anxiety for the next day and a sign of relief. That I can take a deep breath instead of gulping down small ones. "
Tell me about yourself.,"He will be nineteen this Saturday. I think I am going to go crazy trying to get something for the boy who has everything. He just left my dorm room. and we just had a fight. he is going to his apartment to check if his dog made a mess on the carpet. I think he likes his dog more than me sometimes. I am listening to the soundtrack of the tape that I do yoga to because it soothes me. when I do yoga I am so calm. I actually feel very centered and like my whole body is in a perfect line when have finished the whole tape, its an hour long and it really is a workout. my mom got me started on yoga, she's totally addicted now. I am too, but I'm going into withdrawal because there is nowhere in the castilian where I could do it. I am going home to Dallas this weekend and I'll get to see my whole family!!  my mom will make some really good dinner for me because she thinks I'm starving here. I'm not but there's just nothing good to eat. everybody loves the food that their mom cooks them though. I went home last weekend too. the people down the hall are being so noisy . I want to change this CD, I think I just fell into a trance. I do think I was in a trance this morning in biology. my roommate was up until 6 this morning doing some paper and she kept waking me up. she takes a lot of my stuff without asking , and that's not cool. Oh well , she's cool otherwise. I've got other homework to start now so I don't keep her up tonight!!! "
Tell me about yourself.,"I don't like people to know how my mind works if I don't even know them. I guess I have always been protective of my true thoughts and feelings. The irony is that the more you reveal of your self, the better you get to know and become closer to your friends. The first few steps of trust can be some of the hardest (besides the ones after a loss of trust). I think that it is possible to gain trust back. It takes a long time and complete honesty, but it should be acheivable. It is really funny. People say that they don't trust any one they don't know, but they trust checkout people and opperators all the time. Just think about how much information is handed out each day between people that don't know each other. Of course we would be quite paranoid if we didn't trust any one. It just seems like we are ready to talk to some one we have never met before and never will see again more than we would talk to some one in a new class. People are overly concerned with making good impressions. It is important to realize that we are all pron to error. I say this, but I still worry about making good first impressions. I worry about it more if I think I am going to see the person again. If I don't think we will ever meet again, I am more relaxed. My mind is currently switching between a rapid pace of thoughts to blanking out. It is really scarry to think that your mind can just go blank when your not really doing any thing. I can understand your mind blanking out on a particular subject while you are trying to consentration on it, but the total lack of thought is just wierd. Oh my gosh. I just looked at the clock. I hope I have time to take a shower before the floor meeting. I have been going every where to day including a short (very short) workout at the gym. I probably smell. Not that I did that much exercise today. All the machines were full so I was only able to do two machines today. If I had been with a friend I would have stayed longer since I would have had some one to talk to in line while waiting. Athletic centers can be very intemidating places. Every one always seems to know what they are doing and seems to be in great shape. Of course, if you go to work out enough, you are going to be in shape. My back really hurts. I need to sit strait. I am always slouching over. I try to keep my back strait; it just never works for too long. I'm getting tired now. Typing is becoming harder as I become sleepier. Sleep is such an important part of my life. I probably sleep way too much, but it is better than some habbits people have. There is a consceted statement. Trying to say that I am better than some other people. Who do I think I am?  We all have are assests and faults. What time is it?  I really need to go soon. I just hope that when I get there I don't smell too bad or say my thoughts out loud. I am not saying them out loud, but typing them is very similar. The toughts must be processed to make sense and be comunicated. Writing is just a different form of comunication compared to talking. I hope I can find this place. I wish I had a friend to go with me. Large social events can be intemidating when every one seems to already know eachother. May be some of the people I met Saturday night will be there. Then I can finally figure out two of their names. It is so weird. I can remember the conversation we had, what they wore, where we were sitting, every thing but their names. I can't ask them because they remember mine. I don't want to hurt their feelings. I have to go now so I can get there on time. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Tonight I get to go to a date dash function with my new sorority. Some of my friends set me up with a guy that I have never met before. I can't wait to meet him. I hope he is nice and at the same time, good looking!  This week has been good. All my classes are going well, so I feel confident about them and life in general. Lunch today was especially good, since I haven't eaten a real meal in a few days. I love college. It's so good to not have to worry about a curfew and letting my parents know exactly where I am going to be, etc. I love my roommate, and we have almost the same schedule, so that works out perfectly. Last night, I typed an extrememly long letter to a friend that I hadn't talked to in a few weeks, so my fingers are still kind of tired from typing then. That's ok, though, because I am getting some homework done early, so that I don't have to worry about it later on. That is definitely a good feeling. I am also feeling excited because I saw two guys on campus this morning that I know from high school. Ever since the first day of classes, I had been wanted to see someone I knew. It just happens that those two that I saw today were also some of the cutest and most popular guys that I know. Lucky me!  This gum that I'm chewing is from a blow pop that I finished a few minutes ago, and it is already losing its flavor. Those things never last long at all. I have a problem with one of my classes. see, I swam all throughout junior high and highs school, and I want to continue in college, but every time I want to do something, the class is in the way. I've already changed the time once, but it still causes conflicts. That is very stressful. I don't know if I should change it to an early time because then, I would have to take a shower in between classes, and it might be a pain. But then at least I'd have time to go to my sorority meetings and all the fun parties and stuff. But would I have time to take my regular naps in between my classes like I usually do?  No, I don't think I would. Let's see. which is more important?  I guess more things will come up in the evenings than in the mornings, so it might be better to change to that early time. I just don't know. WOw, I have like nine minutes left. THis isn't such a bad assignment. Psychology is actually really fun. I've only been to two classes, but the professor is really funny and definitely keeps my attention, which is hard to do for an hour and a half. I hope the tests aren't too hard, though, because I'm not that great at analyzing and stuff. I took psychology in high school, and it was way different. My teacher bored us to death, and we learned practically nothing. It was the easiest class ever!  I am going home to Houston this weekend, which is very exciting because all my friends from different colleges are coming home, too. We are all going to go see Clay Walker, my favorite country singer. My ex-boyfriend will also be in town. I haven't seen him in over two months. He goes to West Point in New York and had to leave in late June. I talk to him every once in awhile, but I miss him so much. We are still great friends, and I can't wait to see him again. We dated for a year and three months, so its strange not to see him at all anymore. This gum is really ready to be thrown away, but I'll wait for my four more minutes to do so. I have one more class today, and that is a study hall calculus. Those are never stressful, since the T. A. just helps us with some problems like our homework. He's a nice guy. The first time all we did was say our names and stuff like that, but I'm sure we'll actually accomplish something today. At least I hope so. Getting to know people is good, but I really needed some help with a couple of those problems!  Well, I guess it has been twenty minutes, so I better go. Hope anyone who reads this is having a great time!  :) "
Tell me about yourself.,"being new in Texas and on a strange campus with a lot of different people that I've never met, and have no idea what their backgrounds or thoughts may be is weird to me. back home this wasn't the same. All my friends knew me and I knew them. They didn't care about my little flaws. My family was there to support me and care about me. now, I'm hear. alone and people are starting to show their real colors. At first the girls on my floor were accepting and sweet, but now everything has changed. They have this different feelings and thoughts about me. I may have done some things to upset them, just like they have done to me, but I am a forgiving person. I do not hold grudges like others. Which my sister says is a bad trait. guys down my hall, who used to be nice to me, now make fun of he way I talk, the way I dress, just generally me. its hurts a lot. I'm not the kind of person who shares my feelings with others very easily. I try not to let the things they say hurt me, usually they are just joking around. but, it still does hurt. no one likes to be made fun of. Maybe I'm scared of what people think about me. maybe I'm nervous and afraid because I'm in a totally new atmosphere and situation and nearly everyone else has their family and friends nearby, if not living in the rooms with them, the talk to. People who know about their mood swings and personality. but, I don't. At first I didn't think much about all this stuff. I was having a good time in rush and with all the new people I have met. But, things have changes and I kind of wish I had chosen to go to the school where all my home friends went instead of starting anew. but, I guess the reason I'm hear is because I wanted to get away. or at least I thought I wanted to get away. one thing I don't' really like to do is burden people with my problems, especially people I don' know. they usually end up telling me that I should think better about myself or that what I'm thinking isn't right. but, no one really knows what's right for me except me. I tell myself every night that tomorrow I'll try to be a little better at this and try to change that about myself, the things that people get annoyed with so that people will want to be my friend. but, I can't change how I've grown up. my family values have thought me how to be nice to others, but I had to learn on my own how to take it when those people that you think you're the nicest to and like the most can turn on you in a second. that just because you might say a nice thing about someone, that's doesn't mean that the next day they'll remember or even care enough to stop people from hurting you. My mom calls about three times a day. We're pretty close. but, when I was at home she'd annoy me because she always wanted to talk and be around me and I thought I just wanted her to go away. but, no its different. I call her too. I tell her everything that's happened to me that day and ask for advice. I thought I would be that kind of person, but I was wrong. I can't wait to go home and be with people that really know me and accept me right away. I don't' remember the last time I had to work at being someone's friend. I wish I didn't have to write this for so long. I just feel like I'm babbling about the same thing over and over again. I can't type very well either, so some of my words can only be read by dyslexic people. its alright. I'm trying to be as honest and open as possible. A couple of years ago I used to cry everyday. About nothing about something it didn't matter. I was going to go see a psychiatrist. I've never been to one but was always intrigued about what would happen if I went. I think for a little while I'd tell me parents that I HAD to go to one. I convinced them. I dot' know what that was all about. just a phase I guess. I'd still like to go to one. I can't see how someone could like the job of hearing other peoples problems for hors on end everyday. That would be totally crazy. When people tell me their problems I just think about mine and feel bad for myself. I guess I'm self centered or something. I hear people talking in my hall and wish that I could go out there too, but I promised myself that I'd get some work done before I went off to class. I really haven't eaten a lot since I've been here. I skip breakfast don't' eat lunch or dinner. Its crazy. My appetite has totally left. the food is really nasty here. Oh well. When I get home I'll make my parents take me out to a nice dinner. My boyfriend used to take me out to nice dinners, then for some reason her totally stopped. I'm kind of materialistic. or, at least that's what he'd say. but, I learned o accept it because I loved him. or at least I thought it was love. I don't' know yet, and I'll probably never know until I find someone who I feel the same way or more about. That hasn't happened yet. okay, times up. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm curious to know whether or not there is or isn't a timer in this program and if it were possible to just quit typing and claim that 20 minutes have passed. My thoughts and emotions concern my future and what I'm going to do. Do I really want to be a psychology major or am I just saying that because it sounds cool. I want to counsel, but id really like to make a ton of money. Maybe everyone is right, I should be a business major, that's what everyone else is doing. But I don't want to deal with  that crap for the rest of my life. I think its boring and stupid. The future is such a difficult concept to ponder. Sometimes I have different goals for it. should I try to satisfy myself, friends or family?  I mean it when I tell my friends that I want to be a professional wrestler, it looks so stinking fun. Just jumping around and bad acting. Well, an acting career would be nice too, but I'm to shy and insecure for that. I think I could do it, but I wouldn't want to associate myself with the thespian weirdoes. I don't think id be able to be my best if I had a problem fitting in with  weirdoes. Maybe I'm the weirdo. nah. probably not. I may be stereotyping them, but, hey, they're weird man. I've seen the way they act. They put the stereotype on themselves. I'm sure there's a couple nice ones though. I wonder if all the famous actors were at one time like that. My mind just drifted to Tricia. She sent me a message saying that she had a couple of dates this past weekend. I wonder how true that is. Of course its true, but its weird how she never dated in high school and then all of a sudden at A&M she's a hot item. I still think about that monster crush I had on her my sophomore yr. I wonder if she liked me too. Everyone thought she did. But I never had the balls to find out for myself. I'm going to regret that for the rest of my life. I'm such a fucking pussy. The same thing last yr. If I had the balls, I think I could have got something started with  Erica at Baylor. Instead, now, we're just good friends. I could have used some support too. But that fucking Ray would have been too jealous if Erica and I got something started. That prick, I think he could've hooked me up with  Courtney too. But he needed her, if not, who would he use to cheat on his girlfriend???  Then her roommate, Darla, man, she's such a little bitch. The thing is, she's not even pretty man. Its okay to be snobby and bitchy if your hot, but she was an ugly little girl, with  nothing to show for herself. Amazing how she was dating all the time. Then her fucking attitude about how she has the perfect mate in mind, but wants to date, because its part of the  college experience. Ray thought like that too. That's such a fucking crock man. As Christians they shouldn't be thinking like that. if this almighty god already picked out the perfect mate for them, there is no reason for them to date around to have fun. They love justifying things. There is something wrong with  what your doing fi you have to justify it man. And then ray went to that Mexico trip to witness to a bunch of poverty stricken Mexicans. Its funny how he couldn't convert me to Christianity in 9 months, but he thinks he can do a whole Mexican community within a couple of weeks. I guess its easier when you feed them and shit. talk about taking advantage of people. Why don't these gung-ho Christians go witness to the people who really ""need Jesus""  They should make mission trips to Washington D. C. and talk to the politicians. they're the fucking sinners man. and the business people too. they're the ones fucking this world up. working for Satan. They don't want to witness to them because they're smarter than them, and they can't find a way to take advantage of them. Christianity is fucked up sometimes. Sometimes I feel like a hypocrite for going to CBS, but if I didn't I wouldn't know anyone. They're nice and I enjoy being there. But most people there have less of a commitment to god than I do, so oh well. I'm glad I'm at UT though. its way better than Baylor, god, I used to get so depressed there. but I'm proud of myself, I toughed out that bullshit. I miss a lot of the guys though. It was a different sort of friendship, but it was cool. I still wonder if I would've stayed if my 1st semester was like the 2nd. but then again I was about to go crazy towards the end. Jesse and Miguel. and big John almost killed me!!  I hope I date here. I think that's all I need to be happy. a good woman. I'd like to have what lijay has, or anything really. I think I'm the only one in our click rite now without someone to ""talk to"". times up. . "
Tell me about yourself.,"I just always feel like I am better off when I get things done. I have found that I have been procrastinating a lot lately and I just want to get things back into order so I can do more fun things. I was happy about passing by the UT tennis club booth on my way back from class, I am hoping to have time to do that. I really wish I talked to the UT tennis coach abt playing on the team but ihope the players in this club are competetive and have fun personalities at the same time. not only do I like tennis, but I am happy bec it will give me a workout. I don't have much time to go to the gym  now and I really want to work out more often. I picked up an aerobics schedule today so maybe I will have time for some classes. but all of this reading and studying I have to do takes up more time than expected, I just feel like I don't have enough hours in my day to accomplish all of my goals. tonight I had a sorority meeting to go to which was so boring and I just wanted to leave so I could do more imprt things with my time. but I know in the long run this sorority thing will pay off bec I will get to meet a lot of people and it is an easier way to make friends whenyou already have this sort of group formed and you just have to actually meet the people already selected. ok, that was a really long and complicated sentence. another worry that is on my mind is regarding that experimental thing we have the option of doing. when I went to sign up today, all of the experiments were full so now I am worried I wont get a spot in a study and I will have to do the research paper. not that that is terrible, but iw ould just prefer not writing the paper, especially since I already took my time to fill out the pre testing form last night. whatever. I will have to just get used to everything and all the new changes, since I am a freshman and everything. when that happens, then I will be better able to organize my time and not stress so much. speaking of stress, I should have signed up for that reducing stress freshman seminar, it would have been really helpful abt now. actually, all the seminars were full by the time I got to register, since I was at the last orientation session - terrible mistake. I should have come to an earlier one but I didn't decide to come to school here until it was too late to get into the earlier sessions. so I had to go to the later one, oh well. at least I got classes that are required, I can't get everything I suppose. going to the university of florida was my other option but everyone I know, from  my high school and every other part of florida, goes there and I kind of wanted to get away from everything. even though I do miss pewople a lot, I think I am better of here. and, the good business school was a main consideration. since I was accepted, I felt like it was a good opportunity and I shouldn't give it up. everyone always asks me why I came all the way from miami, florida to texas and I always say bec of th ebusiness school. and that's true and all but ir eally like other thinga abrt it too. I was just admiring today the fountains - I love the nvironment. except for the people hanging around on guadeloupe that I have to pass by on my way back to the castilian everyday - where I live. those people scare me, and I know I have nothing to be scared of I just don't like seeing them there. anyway, I am looking at a picture of me and my mother now and thinking about how my parents are leaving on a trip to europe tomorrow morning - that will be fun. I hope they have a great trip an safe. I am always worried abt them, I just don't want anything to happen to them. I know my mom is scared of flying and I just hope everything is ok for them. they have wanted to go to france and england for a long time. actuakly, they wanted to got o italy too - they were all jealous that I got ot go there with my friends a couple of spring breaks ago. whenever I think abt that trip I think abt how I wrote abt it - the uffizi museum to be more specific - in my application to the university of virginia. even knowing that you souldnt write abt trips I still did it, I guess I thought they wouldnt care if I did it. that's funny. I guess I am still bitter I didn't get into there, it was my top choice of schools. but I am happy at UT. I hope it doesn't get as cold as it sometimes does. anything below 50 is terrible for me, coming from miami and all where the temperature stays on an average of 80 - I love it. speaking of which, playing tennis all the time int hat heat was not too much fun, but it was loads of fun. I miss my tennis coach, she sent me a present here but I havent gotten it yet, I should call her. but I havent talked to her inso long I think it would be weird to call her, oh well. maybe I will one day, I guess I should to say thank you when the present comes. or I could send  a card, whatever. I will decide later, if it ever gets here!! well, 20  minutes is up and I would like to write more but, like I said before, so much to do and so little time. I still ahve to read a million and two pages and I only have 2 classes tomorrow. I just want to get te next days reading out of the way so idont have to thinka bt craming it all in tomorrow night. this was fun! "
Tell me about yourself.,"I mean, each day I wonder why I am here on this earth. and then other times, I wonder why I go through some of the stuff I do go through. it seems at times that the ""good"" people get the worst parts of life, while the ""villains"" in life seem to get the better things in life. that bugs the hell out of me. then there is love. something that is near and dear to me. I look around and I see great females who choose to stay in relationships with guys who treat them like ""scum"". it's so ridiculous sometimes. the worst is when these girls as for the nice guy, but when one comes along, they ignore him and guy for the guy that may boost their social status. sometimes I guess the girls out there that are like that deserve the treatment they get. other than, life seems great right now. every piece of the puzzle is here. except one thing. I have no one to wake up for each morning. but other than that, thing seems to be falling into place. I use to be a person that required love and what comes along with it. but after my last relationship, I have learned to take life A LOT easier and just ""chill"". sometimes I might take it to an extreme and therefore I do get myself in trouble or do things that make me disappointed in myself. I worry that this new ""care-free"" life may eventually take me over with it's great appeal. but only time will tell if that will happen. most of my close female friends feel that I have changed to a more fun and loose person, but at what because??. some feel I have already changed too much and have become a totally different person. I do see myself as changing, but the core of who I am has not changed and hopefully it will never change. I feel that my beliefs and morals and etc are still the same. I have changed a few beliefs, or I should, I am considering changing a few beliefs I have, but it's nothing to strong. it's more like how I choose to take life and what I think is important. but some of the beliefs that I am considering changing or what has my friends worried. because once again, they feel I may become a totally new person and become a person without the same sympathy that I use to possess. but like everything else in life, only time will tell. but I see my myself as evolving rather than changing. make sense??. it's like I am becoming a stronger person. especially emotionally. I am still as sensitive as I used to be. tears come natural for me. but as far as love and stuff. it's not as blinding as it used to be. it's like I gained ""sunglasses"" somehow as I evolved. even my poetry has changed with my evolution. my first couple of works were specifically about love and what goes along with it. but my most recent collection focused on death, suicide, and the afterlife. I wasn't at all suicidal or anything. but the artistic side of me wanted to try something different from the usual love stuff. but it seems through everything I do, that I have matured. I am less likely to hold grudges than I used to. I have pretty much become friends with most, but not all of my past ""grudges"". I guess once you get out of high school, things you once considered important seem ridiculous now. kind of odd huh??. there were people in high school that I would have died for and would have died for me, but now we barely talk. and then there's the people I never talked to much, but now I spend most of my time with. it's weird how one summer can change so much. but I guess this past summer ""weeded"" out the friends who weren't really friends. the friends you have now are the ones that will stay true to you for awhile. or at least until something catastrophic occurs. I remember in high school, I thought my click would never break up. we were almost like brothers. but now we are like strangers. maybe time will change things back. or maybe it was just meant to be. but as of now, my life seems to be a constant vacation. yea there is classes and stuff, but everything is so laid back. there is no pressure whatsoever. not yet at least. but we'll have to see how all that goes. life is a mystery and I doubt anything will ever make sense. just take whatever opportunity you get, and never postpone anything until tomorrow. cause you never know, there may not be a tomorrow. and one should always keep their mind open to anything. the most sure people in our world have changed their minds. sometimes our past or the facts that are presented to us can alter our opinion on matter. however, it's okay to have a strong belief about something as long as you believe in it with you heart and nothing more. a lot of people today are just followers. they believe what they are told. they don't think for themselves to see if what they are told makes any sense whatsoever. many cases in history have resulted badly. look at World War 2. the entire country of Germany followed the madman named Hitler. he was a lunatic, but one has top give him credit for being able to convince a whole nation that he was right. then to convince them to allow him to be dictator. the sad thing is that, that could still happen today. maybe not with the same ""material"", but if a person said the right thing with the right motivation, any country could fall. even the supposed ""untouchable"" U. S. A. nothing is untouchable. just like how nothing lasts forever. nothing "
Tell me about yourself.,"He'll never live that down  I'm glad I finally got to this website so I can get these essays over with, I still have to write the other one before Friday--I can't wait till homecoming, Natalie is such a sweet girl--I wonder what color her dress will be?  Who else will I know there?  Is it wrong that I'm going back home after just being there this weekend?  I had so much fun with Natalie but I'm very upset with Brooks. I just have to forget about him and continue reminding myself that he's a jerk and Natalie doesn't like him  how could she ever like such a loser   he can't get along with anybody and he brags all the time. If I ever get like that I hope someone tells me and I hope I listen to them. Wow, this is really neat- it's like getting all my feelings out and it's really relieving some stress. Can I swear, I'd better not, I don't want to get in trouble--this is college you don't get in trouble--Tomorrow is my birthday! actually my birthday is in less than an hour--18 years old means I can buy cigarettes, dirty magazines, get into clubs, get into bars--of course, I would never do any of that stuff--only perverts get dirty magazines and I hate smoking--It would be cool to go to a club sometimes but most of the girls you meet there are pretty easy---I like Natalie so much--I was going to be really upset if she didn't ask me to homecoming--Even though I'm at college and surrounded by a bunch of really cute girls, I would rather be talking to Natalie than any of them. This was the first time we actually spent multiple days in a row with each other. her mom is so old-fashioned--""you saw David yesterday so you don't have to see him again for a long time""  Well we went to a football game Saturday, Chili's on Sunday, and bowling on Monday  I bowled so well 156--that's like the highest I've gotten in 2 years--she's just good luck I guess  I'm so lucky to have supportive, caring parents   they have taught me that school comes first so it is not really that hard for me to be away from home and I don't have too much trouble getting myself to do homework. that stupid lab stuff is due tomorrow. no maybe it's due Friday   I wish I didn't have to take ch 204  it looks like it's going to be the class to give me the most homework   I heard it was a weed-out course for Chem E  I don't really feel that much stress right now--I should be really scared about not making it as a chemical engineer because my dad, uncle, and sister are all chem e's but I know I can do it and I know the only way I won't make it is if I don't  study   I can't wait to be 18  I can finally get a credit card-- if I get a credit card will I spend more money?  I doubt it I have check cards and they're the same thing  I've got to stop eating out so often   dad is paying for all my meals at doby and if I'm too lazy to walk over there it's my own fault ---lazy--am I gaining weight?  the freshman 15--would Natalie still like me if I were fat?  I don't think I'll get fat--I can always diet  I lost 20 pounds just 2 years ago    boy I hope my parents buy a smaller house so they can get me a car  I wonder if they'd ever get me a camaro  probably not ""no 2 door cars you can't get groceries in them""  how often will I be putting groceries in my car anyway?  boy I type pretty fast  I could be a court whatever it's called who types what everyone says--that would be such a scary job  if you ever got behind how would you ever catch back up again?  has it been 20 minute yet  I think so  "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am doing this at the last minute and feel bad that I am but we do not have internet access at my house right now because our America Online is on the fritz but I am very happy that I can do it at the library. Now that I have been typing for three minutes I feel more relaxed and confident, I hope that this computer will submit this to you after I complete the assignment. I have a lot going on in my life at the moment,  pledgeship is taking its toll in me and consuming a lot of my time and at least my business has slowed down at the moment. I have a little time to catch my breath. I am very pleases and excited with UT and look forward to getting back into my groove and having a set schedule. Pledgeship is taking up a lot of time but it is only for 8 weeks and that is good I need a date for the party this Friday night and am a little preoccupied with it. ,  there are a few girls that I have in mind and would like to take and of course I want to make a good impression at my first pledge party so I will look good to my fellow pledge brothers. my pager just went off which means that I have another job to go do and I will do it tomorrow I hope that I am doing the correct thing for your experiment I firmly believe that there can never be a random experiment because once a person knows they are being experimented on it can and will influence their outcome. this is what I told my statistics teacher when we were discussing random surveys. come on have you ever been in the mall and somebody asks you to do an experiment and you slightly alter your answers because either you were embarrassed or the like, sure we all have and that is why people are not truly random  I believe that we all have logarithms that are inherent in our minds, kind of like blueprints or instincts that tell us to act of do certain things and with these being in our mind we can never truly be random. If broken down to the lowest level a pattern would form and from this pattern we would be able to predict responses and behavior thus disproving the theory of randomness My time is about up I hope that you have enjoyed listening to the voice in my head and I also hope that you will see things with a different perspective now. If you don't that's okay because not many people think that the random theory is true anyway. But I do. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Even though I am so tired from running around all day. My gosh, I have to get up at 7 this morning just because Priya's alarm goes off. After that, everything is a blur. I can't go to sleep, but have to be in the half and half stage. Terrifying. I don't like her. She is just so. weird. I mean, she would stand there and just stare outside. Doesn't she have anything else to do???  I am so tired of seeing her all day. Well, my day pretty much is over except for Psychology class. Why is the class all the way over in Jester anyway. I am tired of walking. To Jester and back. That is 15 minutes off my time. I am tired of myself also. Why do I complain so much lately. And so emotional also. I feel pity for myself, which is not cool. Hey, playing racquet ball with Thinh is kind of cool. I miss him so much. I think he was about to cry when I was saying good bye to him. So cute. Hmmm. something about me. Why do I want to see a guy cry all the time?  I think it is something very sexy about it. But the problem is, when they started to feel comfortable and can cry in front of you no problem, then they become too emotional. I want a man, not another ""feminine"" one to take care of. I want him to be my safety, no crying around me. Not too much anyway, unless there is a legitimate reason. Freddy was such a cry baby. So girlie I might say. Man, I think he was just crying to get my attention. Why am I thinking of that dork anyway. Thinh is such a nice guy. So thoughtful sometimes that I am scared I am not good enough for him. But well, that is that. Somehow, I have a feeling we will end up being together. Actually, it is not a feeling, I know we'll end up together and very happy together I might say. I wonder if he is at home now. Hey, I am typing pretty fast. It is kind of creepy when I found all those ants on my short this morning. I look like a mad woman, trying to fend off all those creeps. But the thing is, nobody knows what I am doing. All they see is a girl looking down on her short, prying the slit out. How embarrassing. Oh well, it passed. Nobody would remember me anyway. Just a girl. An ordinary girl. Nobody cares. That stupid Nhut. Johnny and I gave him $200 for his wedding and this is how he treat me?  The nerve. Not that money counts. I am not using money as a criteria. I just want him to treat me right. The way I should be treated. I mean, Thay and Toan's dad had to apologize to me?  I don't want them to apologize to me. I want an apology from Nhut. That egg head. Actually, I don't think there is much in that head anyway. I am so mean.   Let's see. my hand is getting tired from typing all of this. Actually, I think my writing will be one of the longest ones. I think I can type pretty fast. I don't want to write anymore. My eye is so tired. I want to be somewhere else. I want to sleep. I want so many things. But the thing is, those thing that I want doesn't require money. It doesn't cost anything. So I think that this is okay. As long as I don't hurt anybody right?  These things I want are because I don't get much of it. I want Thinh to come to UT and be with me. But then again, if he does come, I think we will be both in trouble because we would not concentrate much on school. Okay, my head is hurting, and I am yawning. I am going to go home right after psychology, eat and then take a nap. Then wake up, take shower the go study. I have to at least get through with the Organic and physics today. My gosh, I have so many things to do. There is Organic, then there is Micro. , Physics, Physics lab. I have to return books to Co-op, and buy books. Buy class manual, then there is those Micro equipment I have to buy. rrArghhh. life as it is with me. so much to do. Why do I have to be such an overachiever???  I hate it. I wish things could just come easy to me. But then again, would life be fulfilling to me if everything I want, I get. Who cares, I would have an easy life. I am itchy again. I think it is just psychology playing on my mind again. You think you have ants on you, therefore you get itchy. rrhehehee "
Tell me about yourself.,"I miss my best friend. My other friend could care less of my existence since he has a woman now. I am so unorganized, and I can't type for shit. I am definately frustrated and scared. I am scared that my classes are going to be extremely hard, but most of all, I wish that I did not have to decide on my future. I have no clue what I want to do with the rest of my life, and that is a really big decision. I wish I could just travel the world and never look back. I really wouldn't mind being a bum, as long as I was in paris. I wonder what Lestat is doing right now. I have so much to read and do, but I just never find the time. THe time is just sitting there waiting on me, but I have yet to find my way. Organization is a good thing to have. Something I do not aquire. Figures. I want to meet some really cool friends, but for some reason, I don't think they are here. Maybe I should have moved to Boston. Now I will prolly never go. Figures again. I paused to think of what to say, and a really bad word came to mind. Again. I don't know what to do. I'm a dork magnet. I have  zits all over my face, and the cute guy next door has yet to be seen. Figures. Ambulences. I hate that sound. I find it very annoying in the middle of the night. Gas. Roommate - uncertain. I was hoing for some drop - dead woman, and get a sad little home-schooler. Oh well she says. Well, it looks like my time is up. . C-you. "
Tell me about yourself.,Tony just walked into our apartment and Ashley is asleep. Maybe I need to work on some other stuff. This pre-testing page is down. it keeps shutting down every time I try to use it. I wonder why I even try sometimes. Why am I doing all this stuff enter night. into night  grain of sand. off to never-never land. I just typed Metallica lyrics. I don't even like Metallica   this is kind of weird. I don't think that I can keep doing this for 20 minutes. Ashley's starting to wake up now. at least most of my studies are done because I'm going to play Broomball later tonight. Do I play at Trees or not?  I just think that it will be too hard to actually get to Dallas in time to do it. I can't relax enough to do stream of consciousness. I'm completely aware of everything I'm typing even though it's not selective. boy Tony is loud. Ashley's so cute when she's sleeping. she's starting to wake up. oh wow. I can see her underwear. she'd be a bit embarrassed. she's up know. and gave me a big smile.        now she's laughing at me. now she's trying to talk to me and distract me from my work. going on for twenty minutes?   My word. I don't have time for this. I think I have the Psychology department figured out but I think they just have everybody take these intro psyche classes so they can get info for their own experiments. they just make it look like a class so they have a bunch of subjects. a cigar. I could use one right now. I'm so stressed out. I'm tired of that bare naked Ladies song. Zach is talking to me right now. what a moron he is. . just about random stuff. . yes go on. exchange the genesis for mario kart. that's a good idea. we're getting mario kart. . I guess I'm going for twenty minutes. . it's been a long time. I have no more to write. I'm going now. by3e. 
Tell me about yourself.,"m exdcited. All classes seem interesting. I'm way on top of the medical school admission process and I keep thinking about it. I am so ready for school. summer school was fun this summer, but for some reason I just enjoy havin the challenge of shool on my hands. It makes me feel successful. That's important to me. I have to make sure to stop and smell the roses also, though. I can be kind of bad about forgetting to do that. But then again succeeding in school is one way I smell the roses. Everything here is so exciting. There are so many girls and I really dig that. I have never seen so many girls in my life. But even with the massive amounts of women that are here, my love woes are the same. I'm just too damn picky. Yeah, yeah I know that's supposed to be good and stuff but it gets old. It seems like no girl ever meets the qualifications. It's like the really pretty girls that I am attracted to are stupid as hell. And the ugly girls or mediocre girls I know have the most wonderful personality in the world. What's up with that?   So goes college life. Despite the lack of girls with any character and looks, its still a thrilling experience. I feel sorry for women. I mean they are totally forsaken in almost all aspects of life. They are judged so much more on how they look, and what bugs me about that is I totally participate in all of the judging. So goes manhood. I like to think of myself as much different than other guys. Someone who is more compassionate and has thought things through, but even I revert to complete childish mentalities sometimes. It can be fun though. girls, though, I remember a few weeks ago before a Taekwon-Do testing, in which I was to help judge (I used to be a taekwon-do instructor), one of my good friends who started taekwon-do with me was also invited. her name is Joanne Walker. The head ""male"" judges decided that she should watch over the receptionists desk while testing commensed. That was such bullshit. She outrankedhalf of the judges, but just because she wasn't more ""assertive"" as they put it, she got looked ofver as usual. This fucking pissed me off. I mean, for the first time I realized that this wasn't the first time this has happened to her. Whenever I won a tournament, it was my name mentioned, whenever there was an award tobe given, it was to be, never to her. I know that the instructors didn't do it on purpose, it just never occurred to them to give credit to the lady. And then it hit me, ""wow, girls totally get looked over, more than guys. ""   Enough about that. I am bored. I want to go play with all of the other college kids in the other room, but no I am disciplined, rooooaaaaarrrr. Anyway, man I hope the Astros go to the series this year, I know that they can beat the braves (maybe). hehe  Oh, I saw this thing on Latrell Spreewell today, that professional basketball player who hit his coach. What a fucking idiot. Man, he was sitting on TV talking about how he was suine the NBA for lost wages. Poor millionare. Something about Mary was very funny, and oh my god, was Saving Private Ryan awsome or what?  I mean that movie freaking changed my life. And Good Will hunting was good too. I liked it partly because it was in Boston, and I would love to go medical school at Harvard. I think I have a good shot at getting in if I do well this year and kick ass on the MCAT, don't worry I will prepare well. Football, this next Saturday, oh yeah!  I can't wait to enjoy the game witht eh buddies and a few budweisers. That budweiser commercial is hilarious, with the lizards. That is a genious whoever came up with that campaign. There are too many stupid-ass commercial advertisers out there. There should be a law against commercials that suck. Like we could havwe a commercial selection committee that could pass a commercial on a 2/3 vote on regular commercials and by a simple majority with Little Caesar commercials. Oh remember that Deep thoughts, by Jack Handy that used to play on Saturday night live?  It was hilarious and this stream of consciousness essay reminds me of that. He would say stuff like, I wonder what the world would be like if dogs ruled the earth. I bet doverman pinchers would control most of the countries, but that would be sad because I'm sure there are some Chiuahauas with some pretty good ideas! hehehehehe, I freaking hate that I don't know how to spell Chiuhua. ahhhhhhhhh! "
Tell me about yourself.,"I have finally made it to college. I miss my family and friends but at the same time I am proud and happy with the changes that have come as a part of college life. It's is something new. I feel confident that I will succeed here at UT, but most importantly, I want to succeed. I am excited about all of my classes and look forward to gaining the knowledge that each professor has to offer. I sometimes worry about finding my special little niche here where there are so many students. However, each day I feel a little more comfortable with myself and the university. Above all I find myself missing someone back home who I have only known a short time the most. He is a wonderful person with whom I have this extraordinary mental connection. Being away from him has made me think more in detail about how the human mind and the concept of relationships depend heavily upon one another. It makes me wonder what abstract thought can make a person be able to relate everything  they see and do someway to another person. I am positive that it is not an obsession but it is something stronger than just a casual feeling. Well I guess I will just have to continue to ponder about the whole situation. "
Tell me about yourself.,"don't take waste a minute you have to have no worries. spending time with people you love and have fun with is what makes those great memories that you look back on. right now I should be living life to it's fullest ( I should always actually) because things only get more and more complicated. sometimes I feel so confused and it gets me down, but the weird thing is, is that I can't pinpoint what I'm confused about. that's bad for me because then I can't talk to anyone about it--that's what usually helps me get things off my mind. I am going home this weekend to see my brother from l. a. California and he is bringing his new girlfriend. I'm anxious to meet her because she sounds so sweet. I wonder if this is the girl he will marry--I always think of that when a relationship begins. I truly believe that a couple should go out at least one year and a half before they think of marriage--it takes a long time to see all of the other's weakness, and characteristics. it is way too hot for me--it drains me so much. I dropped history because I had a really bad feeling about it--the teacher was on a different level than I was and I could not learn from her. I feel a bit weird and guilty for dropping it because I usually stick things out no matter what, but I need to do well this semester so I had to make sure. I really want to go tubing, or hiking or something outdoors every weekend. being outdoors really relieves the stress in me and I am automatically happy. I miss my dog. some people just don't like to get up and do something. they sit there and think about how much energy it is going to take to do something (such as go tubing) and think about how long it is going take to drive there/  rather than just getting up and doing it!  I need to do things that I think of and when I want. no better time than the present. I hate nightmares. they've been sticking in my head lately all day after I wake up. they seem to  be getting stronger and stronger. I dream about sad or fearful things all of the time. exercise is so important for me ( not to lose weight etc)  it seems to keep me happy and feeling good. it's not a chore for me to exercising. what should I write about. I think I want to go sky diving but I seem to be getting more and more fearful of things. more nightmare--fear of animals getting me. I don't want to be a baby about that sort of stuff because I don't want to miss out on anything. I want to do so much outdoors but it makes it hard when I am so scared of animals. I used to be a tomboy and play with worms and bugs etc but it's a different story now. kids also make me happy. they are full of innocence and curiosity. I could sit there and just watch kids all day. I miss soccer and art from when I was in high school. those are things I enjoyed. I decided that I am going to play intramural soccer here. I hope I have fun in it. I want to do tile paintings when I get older. my mother is so sweet, people seem to take advantage of the nicest people in the world. my brother always gets his heart broken because he is so nice. I want to find him the perfect girl because that's what he deserves!  I love and miss my family so much. we have always been so close and everyone can see it. it's a weird close because we don't show our love to  each other all of the time but we are very very protective over each other and interested in helping every one out. there's five kids. big families can be difficult but there are so many good things about it too! "
Tell me about yourself.,"I tried three times to get this web site and it kept bringing up that the server was down. I am the mother of a 10 month old and when he goes to bed, that is the time I need to get busy and do my work. I often stay up until 2 or 3 am trying to get everything done that I need to get done. I have the King and I on the TV, I am looking very much forward to going to the Bass concert/ performing arts center to see it. I bought three tickets. My husband and I are going and taking my grandmother for her 75th birthday. it should be a real treat. the house is quiet except the TV (on low) and the dishwasher. I love the sound of the dishwasher. It is a night time sound for me because when I was growing up my mother would turn it on after the news on her way to bed. It is a comforting sound. It was a  normal bedtime noise then, now 20 years ago, and now in my own home I enjoy the sound. I would miss it if we were to get one of those new expensive machines that didn't have the same rolling and tumbling sounds. I love water, the ocean, it kind of reminds me of that, but in thinking about it also probably sounds like being in utero. This musical is so beautiful, I just love the musicals of the past, a time long gone except you can visit through videos, theatre in your mind. Its sort of and escape from daily hectic real life schedules. Speaking of hectic every day schedules, my car is in the shop. It was there today since 9am and at 445pm I hadn't received a call about it yet. I don't think they are very considerate,  I had to call, and if I hadn't would they have closed up and gone home without saying a ***** word to me! probably. In order for me to be in class at noon tomorrow, I need to have Nicholas at the daycare by 11am . and I have to have a way to get the car. Freddie works night at the post office and he needs to go to bed when he gets home, not fool around waiting to take me down to the Honda service dept. being without your car is a big pain in the butt. It is the air-conditioning , door locks, and electric window. of course, it is the drivers window that is messed up, and when you unlock the door with the key, it sometimes does and sometimes doesn't lock and unlock the real drivers door. and usually it is when I have my arms full of stuff, the baby, and when I am in a hurry. As soon as I am finished, here in a matter of minutes, I can go read the mountain of books I had to get this semester. Man, this assignment is making me sweat. When I complain about things I often feel bad, because I know there are people who have it worse than  I do. We watched TITANIC . broken up in three evenings, it was good, but it made me cry. what a way to die. or lose your family or loved ones. Life is the sweet with the tart. I guess. I am curious what will be achieved from your collection of these stream of consciousness writings. I have more than satisfied the 20 minute requirement now, I would like to print this as a receipt, but guess what? my ink cartridge is out, and it was for the survey too, so I hope I can pull it up again and print it when I get out to buy one, I tried at target last week, but of course, they were out !!! the story of my life. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Metallica. Some of the old stuff so its a lot more music and fewer lyrics. But really, now that I think about it, twenty minutes is a long time to write. At some times, my head is full of random thoughts I can write about but there are not too many tonight. I think part of that is because I am tired. I knew Mondays would be long when I registered for classes and ended up with a lab from seven to nine on monday night. But today seemed long. At least my classes are manageable except for Calculus. I think I will have to work harder to keep up in that class. Actually work hard just to stay with it instead of working to be far ahead. Well maybe I won't have to take too many more difficult math classes after the next couple of semesters, especially if I transfer out of elec. engineering and go into the business school. But I heard the other day that not many of the classes you take in the engineering courses transfer well to business so I may have to start over. I know that the computer science course I added will not transfer but I decided to take it anyway because I would like to know how to program at least in a general way. Never know when that could come in handy. It sure has been hot the last few days. Weeks. Months. I have also had to walk all over campus just to get all of the administrative stuff out of the way like paying my add bill today and getting the sports package over at the stadium. I got a lucky  break and got to pay in the UGL instead of having to wait in the very long line for the cashiers in the main  building. A lot of stuff has happened in the last few weeks. I wonder how Tricia is doing. And Daniel. And Chad. He really had a tough week last week. I feel bad about writing that screwy email. It just reminded him that he didn't get to go to the college he wanted. I wonder what caused the extra fees? Too bad he won't get to play football for them. That reminds me that we are going to the game Saturday. I need to go get tickets tomorrow. In the morning after class. The food has gotten bad over the last few days. Maybe it comes in cycles of the stuff I like. Or maybe they just serve the good, fresh stuff the first week or so to give the impression that the food is actually good. That is the funnier one to tell. It is always good to have a good cafeteria joke for all of the family and other people back home. Sterotypes of college. Most are at least partway true but sometimes it gets tiresome trying to explain the real so you just let them believe it and so forth and so on this paper is dragging on I really don't think they mean to read them all. Should I include all of this stuff or just do some selective deleting? I guess if anyone reads this they will never know anyway. What do you think? Do you think I deleted anything? That will remain one of life's little (very little) mysteries. That about does it for the twenty minutes. Only a few seconds to go. I wonder if I will finish with this sentence or if it will go on until the time "
Tell me about yourself.,"Sometimes, I don't understand my ex-Boyfriend. He tends not to tell me everything, especially the ones that he thinks I shouldn't have to worry about. Maybe it's because we didn't have enough time to know more about each other before I left. A lot of times, I sincerely wished I had known him earlier, and things between us could have been lot better. When we were together, I didn't think I would miss him that much even if I came back to US. But, somehow, he knew I would miss him. But I really didn't realize how much I miss him until now that I am back here. I couldn't call him nor email him. The only thing I can do to keep in touch with him was write letters. It takes about a month back and forth. And one month is really too long for me. I want to know how he is doing and if he misses me as well. I wish he could come here to see me. But I know it's just my imagination to something that's almost impossible. Even though we never really talk about how we are now since we are so far away from each other, at least, I know that we are still good friends. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I just came back home to Austin from Houston this morning. It was not a bad drive today. I am now at home relaxing for the remainder of the day. I really kind of miss home but I guess I will get used to living on my own after a little while. I miss my parents and girlfriend. It is hard to leave the people you care about the most knowing you won't see them for a period of time. Hopefully though I will start to meet many new people here at the University of Texas. I really like Austin, now I just need to explore it. I know a few people up here and they have helped make it a lot easier to be here. I hope school is not too terribly hard. I know I must study and do all of my assignments and make sure I do not fall behind. I think reading and attending class are two of the most important elements of college. I am somewhat scared though at the fact that three tests comprise your semester grade. If you do bad on an exam, you will really have to work hard to pull yourself back up. I just don't know?  I need to get into the routine of college before I can give a valid evaluation of what college really is to me. I hope I do well. Enough with school. I am so excited to be living on my own. I have new responsibilities as well as many new freedoms. There is nobody here to tell me when to come home or what to do. I am the superior. With this new freedom though I know I must watch and take care of myself. No one is here to pick up after me and no one is here to watch over me which is kind of frightening. It creates a sense of happiness, but at the same time a sense of fear also. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I even went to summer school here in the Preview Program and I still find myself in amazement sometimes. I am adjusting well-- a great deal better than my mom. That could be because college is something I knew I had to do and the University of Texas at Austin has always been the place I wanted to be. My classes are okay. I have a sort of messed up schedule. I really cannot complain. Tuesdays are the only days that totally messes with my mind. I cannot seem to get signed up for a research experiment in Mezos. I have went by a numerous amount of times. I like to get things done ahead of time. I am just now doing this because the lab is always full. I am too lazy to go to the one at my apartment complex and when I came to the lab yesterday I totally messed up on the waiting list procedure. When it asked for your name, I put in my name instead of my if account. so I couldn't log in and it assigned my computer to someone else. When I used the lab over the summer I never had to get on a waiting list, so I did not know. I did get quite embarrassed though. I did it right today. But I guess I did not anticipate doing so, I did not bring a disk. As far as I can tell though I don't need one to complete this assignment. so let's see, school is doing fine. I am having roommate trouble a little bit. I live off-campus and I have 3 roommates. Well, 3 of us get along fine. But one attends ACC and she is 17 years old (boy, does she act it). Well, that is the only thing that is bothering me. I am stuck with her for a year. She lied to get in our apartment and now we are stuck with her. Oh well. In my Philosophy class, which I just left by the way, Professor martinich is so interesting. He wrote two of our textbooks. He' s real perceptive and insightful. I am taking Philosophy of Religion. There are about 150-200 people in the class, so we have SI Groups. I hate my SI. We are supposed to discuss and we actually get graded for it. But, I don't fell comfortable doing so. I love to talk and I have plenty of opinions, so that's bothering me. The only thing I can come up with is that when talking about a thing like religion everyone comes into the discussion with strong opinions. Like last week, we basically argued. I made a comment and they looked at me like,"" Boy is she stupid. ""  I don't  like that. Even the TA acts like he has his own views and those that are against the grain aren't worth listening to. He questions your comment and accepts others. I don't  know. I am thinking about talking to Dr. MArtinich. I guess I'll give it one more try. that was just the first one. I shouldn't get counted off for being in an uncomfortable environment. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I mean, there were many questions about over eating. of course everyone wants to lose weight that is a given. and the thing about the spiders is just plan dumb. oh but my friend on the fourth floor asked me to go up and kill a lizard for her. when I went in to the room she was on top of a chair with a flashlight shinning at the lizard. it was hilarious. and it wasn't like the lizard was huge. she was just really really afraid. man, I  have a lot of homework and studying to do. I came here in the summer and I always had reading to do and now it is like I have 3 times the work. it is very cold right now. my room always stays below 60. oh man, I woke up at 11:00am to the sound of someone drilling!! I was very upset. it lasted about an hour and a half. I have a lot of laundry to do. my clothes are all strung out on my floor. I wonder if anyone is going to read this besides the psychology department. I don't think any normal people would want to read this. you know it wasn't until this previous year that I learned how to spell psychology correctly. weird huh? I just never took the time to learn. my sister went and watched saving private ryan. she said that it wasn't any good and that she hated and the killing. and now she will have a test over it on monday. she said it was hard for her to pay attention. for her sake I hope she paid good enough attention that she passes it. I had the same english teacher that she has right now. I won't mention any names but she is a really hard teacher. she started out as a dean of students at sul and then she went to my old high school. she was really hard and expected a lot out of us. I found that I like the challenge. I think that someone just had a wreck. I'm sitting here typing and I heard screeches and then a bang. I heard that this morning, only it was a bigger bang. I didn't get up to look. I was very tired. I hope that everyone is okay. my room is very cold!!! I wonder why they set the thermostat so low. here it is in the summer and I'm sitting in my room with sweet pants and a long sleeve shirt on. I normally have on a sweater. you know, I wonder what everyone else will be typing about. I decided not to worry about capitalizing my words because the instructions stated to not worry about grammar or sentence structure, which is great because I'm not that good with grammar and sentence structure. I wish we didn't have to type for 20 minutes. I have been going for 13 minutes now. I hope that the next seven minutes go by fast. to whoever is reading this, how many have you read? I wonder if there are any interesting. I think that psychology could be interesting. I just don't like some professors. for example, in my exercise physiology class I have this proff that just kills the class. not literally, but it is a very interesting class and I have trouble staying awake. I wonder if I chose the right major. I mean I like physical therapy and all, but I think that I would rather be working with cancer patients. I wonder what people are writing on this thing. I wonder if someone is treating it like their own personal diary. I have four minutes now. after these four minutes are up I'm going swimming. no not really, I have to do homework. I have a big concert to go to tomorrow and I'm trying to finish all my studies. you know I use to never use the word studies but for some reason it just came to my head. I like to write papers like these, no grammar, no structure just typing. I like to type I can type over 70 wpm. I'm currently looking for a job. and so if the person reading this knows of any available positions that I might be good for, you just let me know. I have one more minute left and I plan on finishing at the time I am suppose to. I bet that some people don't type for twenty minutes. I could have typed for 10 minutes for all you know. for some reason at the beginning of this assignment I was thinking about things to type but not any more. obviously. well my time is up. peace out. "
Tell me about yourself.,"it stresses me . I this what I want to do or I am finishing something merely because I feel I have to. I think this is what I want my degree in but just maybe not what I want to do seriously. I am so much happier about my life at school already. I want to meet a good guy that I can hang out with and not worry about how I look and stupid stuff like that. I just hope it happens pretty soon. I love art now. There something so mysterious about it to me. What were they thinking?  Although I think some of it is sketchy as to call it some sort of meaningful piece but I guess it is to them. It is definitely one of those things left to the beholder. I am not sure if I buy into all this psychology stuff,  It is a little hard to follow. We'll see. Just out of curiosity, what are they going to be able to tell about me from this bit of blabber. I bet they read a lot of weird stuff. I am normal, I guess. Sometimes I am a bit complicated but in an interesting way, of course. I do stress about that. If I am to complicated for the guys I am around at school. So many of them are just existing until their next beer. Get a life. and a job. I think I am looking in the wrong place. maybe I am looking and that is my problem. It is kind of something that makes time pass. You know, waiting for the next guy, wondering what he'll be like, if you know him already, if he has a girlfriend. I am stressing that I will have to stay up too late tonight. Couldn't stay awake in class,  That bothers me. It is rude. I don't know what to say for 20 minutes. I probably won't go the whole time. I have a lot to do. I wonder what they think of me so far. Honestly what I am thinking now is not always what is on my mind so forming some sort of a synopsis is unjust. Just checked to see how much I had written. This is really boring, you know. I talk to myself all day. The last thing I wanted to do was write it down. I have to try to balance my spending every month. I have 3 weeks left and its not looking good, already. If only I had a job, I wouldn't feel so bad about asking for extra cash every month. But I don't and I do feel bad. I must go, this is driving me insane. I keep thinking about what I have to do. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I got very bored doing my chemistry homework so I decided to do my psy. I am very excited about tomorrow night because my sorority is having a mixer. I am a little confused about what is going on with my ex-boyfriend. I guess since that is what I am thinking about I might as well write about it. I don't understand why boys expect so much from girls when they are starting college. Sometimes it really gets on my nerves how they expect you to come see them in another town every chance you have. They must not understand that we have other things to do. They are not always more important, but they are things that we are obligated to. For example, all I have heard about for the past year before I even came to school here was how bad sororities are. That is the biggest bunch of bull I have ever heard. I am now in a sorority, broken up with my boyfriend and having the best time hanging out with my friends. Now he is telling me that it is great that I am in a sorority, but I just think it is a bunch of crap. He is just telling me what I want to hear. I have done it   plenty of time. Anyways, why worry about that. Well on to a new subject. I love how brain wanders in very different directions all the time. Like tonight, I planned on staying in my room and making the most out of my time. Well since I love my friends so much, when one of them called me and asked me to take him to his truck, I got up and did it. I wasted an hour and a half just out talking to people I did not know. Oh well, I made a couple of new friends. I also hate it when the   phone rings non stop and every call is for me and I have to stop reading to talk to these people who call asking me how I like college. What do they think I'm going to say, that I hate it and want to go back to litttle bitty Bay City. Yea right!  I was excited though when my aunt called and told me to come over any time I want to. And when I got to talk to my best friend in the world it was a lot of fun. Anyways, I don't even have the slightest idea what I am writing about because I can't remember what I have said. I guess I am getting CRS like my mom. I guess it happens when you have more things to organize and think about. I am really glad that my parents made me take typing in high school because I would have a  problem typing all of this if I could not type. I am really pumped up about the football game this weekend. I am so glad that a group of us are going. Well my time is almost over and then I can go up to my room and mark off one assignment from my list that I made. I am really glad that I am an organized person and take on responsibility well. So far organizing time for all of my homework and all of my social activities has gone rather well. I have not had to miss anything and I have kept up with my reading. Well since this is not a grade, I guess since I rambled on it is o. k. My mind is not thinking very complex right now. Just very simple no brained thoughts after a very long day of classes!  "
Tell me about yourself.,"Yesterday I could not get it to work and I was frustrated. I am feeling happy now that I know how to do this. I am also all caught up in my reading so that is also a good thing that makes me feel good. I hope I can do that for the rest of the semester and stay on top of things. I am worried though about an assignment I have do tomorrow and need to get it done on time. I have to find an example of it though on the computer and that hasn't happened yet and that makes me feel frustrated. I will be relieved once I get that done. I have never done an assignment like this before and it is kind of different and new to me. I am not used to writing down everything I think about and my feelings. I am also pretty tired right now and could use some sleep. I hope I get my things done early tonight so that I can get some sleep. Today it has been hard for me to concentrate and not start daydreaming in class. When I am tired it is hard for me sometimes to pay attention. I make sure though I hear what the professor is saying and not get behind or that would bother me if I knew I missed something important that he said. In a little while I have to take a Calculus quiz that I am worried about. I don't like to take quizzes because I get nervous before they start, even when I know the material. Right now I feel like I need to go workout. I enjoy working out and haven't done much of it since school has started. It makes me feel better and more energetic when I run. I feel good about myself and what I am doing. I like to take breaks when I am studying, so that I don't study for long periods of time without taking a break. For example, after I finish one subject I either watch TV for a little while or grab a snack and then go on to the next subject. This helps me when I am studying and I feel great once I have finished studying or reading a subject. It has been really hot outside today and it feels good whenever I finally come into a building that has air conditioning. I had to walk all the way across campus from class to my friends dorm and once I got there I was tired and hot but now I feel a lot better. I have always carried a backpack with me even in high school but now it is harder in college because you have to walk a lot greater distance. I really don't know what else to say. It won't be long and my next class will begin and I must get prepared for my upcoming quiz. I am really glad though to have at least one of these writing assignments done now. It is one thing off my list of things to do. I feel I have now finished one more task of the day. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I believe sometimes I think to much about what's at hand. I always have to be scheduled and know what's to come. I wonder if its just good discipline or if its a problem. For example its the first day of class and I'm doing the writing assignments already, it was my mind so I did it. My mind is wandering, I'm thinking about my girlfriend at home and what she is doing and thinking about, hopefully me of course. What are my other friends doing that went to others schools, do they feel pressured. What am I suppose to be thinking or typing about. I wonder if your looking for any certain topic we should be thinking about. Am I going to do well in this class, will I get an A, B , C, D, or even fail? I guess I will find Out Eventually. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I already wrote a 20 min passage for this assignment. Unfortunately, when I tried to submit it, it didn't work. There was some sort of error and now I am having to redo the entire thing. So basically, I simply feel frustrated that I have to redo this assignment when I could be using my time for something much more useful than this. Beyond that, my thoughts are concentrated on my future. I am currently trying to decide what I am going to do with the rest of my life. I feel as though this is a very big decision. well, it is! My decision today is going to affect the sequence of events for the rest of my life. My career choice will determine what kind of people I meet and what kind of contribution I make to the world, and what the value of my work will have. It is important to me that I make a good decision. For this reason, I feel a lot of pressure to choose wisely and not rashly. I want something that will be viewed as impressive and intelligent. I suppose this shouldn't really be a factor. After all, isn't the most important thing that I am satisfied with my job? The opinions of others shouldn't influence me. And yet, I want people to think that I am intelligent. I can't help it. That is just the way I am. Perhaps I have a bit more of Peter Keating and a bit less of Howard Roark in my than I would like. Another important factor is the value of my work. I would like to have the satisfaction of contributing something useful to the world. For example if I were a microbiologist, I could work in the medical field to find a cure for a disease. Another important factor is money. I would like to say that money isn't important. However, this is a lie. I want very much to make enough money to be able to enjoy life. I want to be able to order food at a restaurant without considering the price. I want to be able to go on vacations every year. I want to see the world. Of course I need someone to have fun with while I do these things but that would fill up an entire additional 20 of writing if I went into my thoughts on social and antisocial feelings. The underlying point here is that I want to have money to do things that will help me enjoy my life. If these were the only criteria, I think I could find a job fairly easily. The real clincher is the next criterion. I want to enjoy my job. I know that some people think this is not important, my dad being one of those people. However, I don't want to spend the rest of my life in a job that I am going to hate. I don't wan t to get up in the morning and dread going to my job. I don't want to have to drag myself out of my bed. I am going to spend many hours every week at my job and so I want to make sure I enjoy it. Not only do I want to enjoy it, I want to make sure I choose the career that I will enjoy THE MOST. Perhaps this is the reason that I find it so difficult to make a career decision. I feel as though I am currently being productive in my career quest. I added a class this semester that will allow me to explore engineering and determine if I might possibly love a career in architectural engineering. If not, I have determined that I should remain in the college of natural science because that is where I will find a courseload that interests me the most. Surely if I choose a major that interests me, a career that interests me will be a corollary. "
Tell me about yourself.,"It is Friday, which means that school is done for the first week. My classes have gone extremely well. I have calculus, MIS, Psychology, Intro to Western Music, BA101. My calculus teacher is kind of hard to understand, though. I am also very happy because I have worked out at the gym every day since moving here. I am trying to lose weight and have already lost three pounds. I am also trying to eat better. I run for between 10 to 30 minutes, walk, and do the bicycle machine. The Castilian looks like it has delicious food, but since I'm trying to eat healthy, it's kind of hard looking at all the people eating ice cream, pizza, hamburgers. Once I get to my goal weight, I am going to allow myself one food treat a week. Another reason I am happy is that my email is finally working. It took two hours for a man here to set up my internet. I was on the phone yesterday for like eight hours trying to set up my email. No one seemed to be able to help me. A guy came in today and hooked me up in less than half an hour. Now I have a ut account and one with Juno. I emailed my dad today, and he wrote back. Tonight I hope I do something fun. It is great having a roommate I have been friends with since the sixth grade. We both know when to study and when to have fun. We study every week night and try to go to bed as early as we can. She is in Architecture. She is going to be very busy with that. My sister did not go to college. My parents are moving to Austin in September. That will be convenient for when I want to see them. The window to our room is open right now and it feels great out. The tower is chiming and I am in a fantastic mood. Earlier, when I was in the elevator, the lights turned out for a second and it seemed as though the power was going to turn off. I gasped!  I feel lucky to be able to come to college here to get an excellent education. I hope to have a job I love once I graduate and to be successful. Once I get my first job after college I plan on saving a lot of money and also investing. I think about my future a lot. I'm kind of a worrier. I've met some really nice people at the Castilian. A lot of the girls here just got finished rushing for their sororities. I didn't do that. I don't think I have time for it as well as how much money it becausets. I was surprised that two of my professors are women and the class I haven't gone to yet is also taught by a teacher. For some reason I felt that a lot of the professors were going to be males. I did not bring a car to school because the car I had was really old. We've had it since before I was born. It's a 1979 Toyota Corolla. I had a love/hate relationship with it. I loved it because I've known it forever. I hated it because it was so slow and had no radio. I had a yellow jam box in there so I could listen to tapes I made. It got really good gas mileage, though. A lot of people from my home town, Temple, go to school here. My roommate's older sister is a sophomore at UT and she stayed at the Castilian last year. We requested her room and got it. We face the tower. I forgot to take my vitamin today. I should do that before I go to dinner. I can't wait until I can have a dog. I love dogs. When I was in elementary and middle school I had a Yorkshire Terrier named Candi. She was the cutest little thing!!!  My roommate had a really great mutt the whole time I knew her named Charlie. He had to be put to sleep. Her family got a new dog who is really stupid named Bailey. His parents names were (not joking) Terry Punky Panda and Cowboy Junkie Jow. This dog is literally the stupidest dog I've ever met. He doesn't understand when you don't want him near you. He's chewed up a lot of my roommates stuff at home. Both her mom and my dad work for the same company. Hopefully this coming summer I can get a job there doing something. I've had a job since I turned 16. Well, Got to Go. I'm going to eat dinner and take a shower for tonight. I am in a great mood!!!!! "
Tell me about yourself.,"Why must it be so hard?   Why must I live like this?  Would it not be better if I simply throw away my life?  It would be so much easier. I wouldn't have to worry all the time about people's criticism. I wouldn't have to worry about making mistakes. But then, I'm human am I not?  Aren't we social creatures?  If I seperate myself from others, would I not cause myself harm?  Would I not also cause others pain?  A life lost is a gift lost. It is so difficult for me to live like this. Always in pain. But sometimes I gain a sense of glory when I live through the sufferings. It's as though these sufferings are meant to makme stronger. Like steel being tempered in a hot flame. Yet, there's still more pain to come. Will I survive?  surely there will be a point when I will not get stronger and break. But then how will I know where my limit is?  whether I live a mediocre life or on to te fullest, I will die. However, it seems as though the latr fashion of life is better. Therefore, with spirit, I will strive to live out that lifestyle. I try each moring, to fight the tempatations and do what is expected of me. If I live this way and think that it is the best way. Should I not persuade others to do the same?  Why not?  It seems that if everyone lived their life more fully, mankind will be more efficient and fruitful. We will  prosperous as  whole. But if I were to tell this opinion to others, someone will tell me that I should respect their opinion that they can do what ever they wish. But if it is right to repect all the opinions of all people. Would there not still be a conflict which contradicts that opinion that says that we all must respect the opinion of all?  For example, what if someone else's opinion is that people should not accept all opinions as truth. Would not the opinion of the person saying that we should respect all opinion be contrary to that opinion?  This brings about a lot of contradictions. Hence, notall opinions are to be respected.           "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm not sure since I've just started College and haven't had any tests yet. I need to be working it my girlfriend has started to grab me and choke me but now I'm getting hungry but wait she started licking my ear and stroking my stomach but is it going to rain today and will I ever get some sleep. Not if I have to keep typing this damn assignment. But who needs sleep anyway I wondering if I have any beers left in the refrigerator and if the born on date is really when the beer was born. Two really nasty people just walked by outside the make me say to myself damn those people are nasty but who am I to judge people for being nasty. My girlfriend just said that I'm nasty but who cares she still kisses me. I need to be working so I can make money to pay for this damn class that is taking up all my time and keeping me from getting any sleep so that I have to worry about being tired at my job and then losing my job and not being able to pay for this damn class which I'll probably make a bad grade in anyway because I don't have enough time to study since I have to work to. Oh I'm wondering if they are going to open the UT Tower again and if some people will find out just how tall the tower is. I don't think it should be opened because if people are stupid enough to jump off the tower, they would have went somewhere else and jumped off something else. It has been a very gloomy weekend that was once again to short. But live moves on sometimes a very slow pace and sometimes at a more rapid pace. My significant other is wondering what I'm typing right now, so I am going to type faster so that she can't read everything that I just typed about 15 minutes ago. Anyway, I'm tired of typing and a fat whale just walked by outside, so I have to go chase her so that I can return her safely to the ocean. Alright then bye know because I've been typing for twenty minutes and I need to go smoke a cigarette. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am going home for the weekend, and I'm wondering what it will be like after being gone for two weeks. I miss home, my friends, my family, everything about corpus christi. I mean, I'm not sad or anything, but I really cannot wait to get there. I'm thinking of how the bus ride will be on the way home, how it is kind of inefficient to take greyhound because of the schedules and long time that it takes to make a relatively short trip. basically, my mind is not thinking about one specific thing. rather, many thoughts are coming to me during the days here at UT. memories of high school, things I did, things I said, just normal context between me and my friends. after not making longhorn band, I often find myself reflecting on band in high school, the band that we all seemed to always be complaining about, but the band that now seems so great to be a part of. I think about being in it, taking solos in jazz band, and that seems to be where I want to be right now, most of the days, that's where I'd like to be. I think about the solos I took on various songs, the ideas I came up with, and the ones I'm coming up with now; I wish I could be in it to play them, I whistle and hum the different rhythms that I would play, my friend and I try to remember all of the songs that we played last year, and the various experiences that came along with performing. I also am thinking about my family and friends, how I miss them, and how I'm going to them this weekend. I think of how I want to be in corpus, and how to make the weekend last as long as possible. I'm trying to think of what to do there, and whether or not I will get to go to laredo to see the football game for my high school. hopefully so. besides that, I think about my sister in Houston, how she's coming to austin this weekend, and how I'm going to corpus this weekend. but I know that we'll see each other soon. I think about my room at home. the food I'm used to eating in corpus, how I really want to eat there because I'm tired of this dorm food. I try to remember as much about home as I can, but there always seems to be more that I think of later. so much complexity about home; however, when I was there before moving up here, sometimes things seemed to boring, but not now. corpus seems like home, because it is. I just can't wait to be there, and I can't wait to go again, hopefully in two weeks. I also think about my classes here, how I'm wondering how I'm going to do in them, if I'm studying enough or writing down the right things in my notes. I hope that I will do good on my first tests, and I hope that the semester is not too hard as long as I study and keep up with everything. I think of my classes at high school, whether I was that smart or not, I wonder if I'm smart enough to be an engineer, I hope that I do not feel inadequate about myself or start feeling like I'm stupid or something. I think all of these thoughts right now, and like I said, they pop in and out of my mind, with no constant or predictable duration or timing. it almost seems like I'm thinking about everything at the same time, and I guess, various specific thoughts become highlighted or standout every now and then, but while I think about everything I can concentrate on one thing while also thinking about everything else too. other than that, my thoughts are pretty much summed up in this paragraph. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I want to get good grades in all my classes. My goals is to get between a 3. 5 and a 4. 0. which is really going to be hard between fraternity and classes. I really like this college and have seemed to have adjusted well. I like my roommate. He cracks me up. his little insights on lfe entertain me. tomorrow I am going to work out. I need to run. this will keep me healthy and make me feel good about myself. I have to ask a date to My fraternity function for Friday night. the girl I want to ask isn't home but hopefully will be there later. I think that she is cute, and that she might like me. I am worried about classes. I haven't been able to review all my notes. there is just too much to do in this damn town. I heard about my ex-girlfriend today. I hope I never see her again. she amde my senior year so hard. I was so upset over her. I never understood how one person can have such an effect on another person. She might come in for AC, a sammy party. I hope that she doesn't come near me, because if I'm drunk I'll probally tell her to go to hell. I mean, after all she broke my heart. I was the one who felt like shit all the time. I hope she chokes on her own food. But I don't want her to die. Professor said today that love and hate are mixed together. he is so right. I hate stacy so much, but sometimes I just love too much. I wish I could sever all ties with her--oh well shit happens. She just makes me so angry, but my anger is a sign that I haven't gottne rid of my ties to her. this assignment take a long time. I'm really tired because I have been up since 5:15 in the morning. I had to go get football tickets-yea!  I'm going to the 1st game on saturday, that will be a blast. The crowd will probally be nuts. I can't wait. This university is so cool, I just wish that there were no street people on the drag. They just sit around and smoke and ask you for change. These kids need to either go home, I hear that they choose to live that lifestyle, or become a ward of the state. I am almost tapped out. Writing my thoughts is a very hard task. it is mentally challenging. I want to go downstairs to ask out slyvia, but I dn't know if she is home, maybe ill just call alec and see. I have one more minute. My mind is almost blank because I'm so tired. This course is quite hard and I wish you would explain the concepts better. I have to go read my book. Times up. See you in class "
Tell me about yourself.,"At the dorm where I live there is a girl that is Anorexic, and we all call her Annie for short. This s probably the rudest thing that you could ever possibly do to a person in this state, but then she doesn't know that we call her this. I am also confused about guys, and why they react the way they do. My friend told me the weirdest story about her weekend today. She said that she was dancing in a club and this really big guy started pissing on her leg, and then her boyfriend hit the guy right in the sweet spot, and the bouncers kicked her boyfriend out instead of the pisser. That is so not fair and disgusting!  I can not believe that someone would actually do that in the middle of a crowd of people. Anyway I really do not know what to talk about because I am really tired. I slept today for about two hours, and now I am more tired than I was before. I ate lunch at Papaduex today and I had Alligator for the first time. It was really good and it kind of tasted like chicken. Well I just talked to my boyfriend on the phone and he told me that one of the guys he used to work with died today in a high speed car accident. The funeral is on Tuesday, and he wants me to go with him because he can not cope with it by himself. I have a problem with dead people and funerals, and I swore that after my grandpa died, I would never go to another funeral. Well I really want to see a movie pretty soon, because I haven't seen one in a long time. I really need to see the Horse Whisperer, because I heard that it was a really good movie! "
Tell me about yourself.,"of course I don't ever really cry--or at least not very often. I've been waiting for a really big cry since I moved here a month ago--but no tears. I left some of my best friends--though I have over a dozen friends here from my home town of College Station--but not all of them and I left my house and my birth city and my parents and two of my dogs(the third one I brought with me). though I don't really know why I am writing this to the computer as if it will respond back or much less cares at all about my personal life. I suppose that i am just suppose to ramble and write what is in my head--yes I am so tired that I am repeating the directions for this assignment out loud to myself and I am actually so bored and tired as to write them down as part of my assignment. I suppose that that bit alright. it is now 1:28 am and that means that technically I cannot write again until after mid night tomorrow or today or whatever which is too bad because that would make my life easier to be able to do it tomorrow afternoon because I only have one class but I suppose I should stop bitching at the computer. because frankly it is a computer--of course now I am worried that this should have been some philosophical expression of how I, erin, tick as a human being--but now I am way to tired to rewrite this--if it won't send properly then I promise myself to do something deeper next time--for now, however, I'm done. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I have so many things going on in my life right now. Pat Wedge, the cheerleading coach, called me yesterday and invited me to come and work out with the squad. I do not know if I am ready to cheer this semester. Right now my biggest concern is my grades. I am going into am interview on Wednesday with romie, from K-Hall agency, I love to model and I hope my career will progress in Austin. Then today I called thr director over the Miss Austin paegent, she is going to mail me information to compete in the paegent in Feburary. All of this adds on to my never ending stress. I guess you can say ""I do not like to put all my eggs in one basket"", at least my mom tells me that. I like to try everything life has to offer, so I will fill satisfied. Besides all my extraciricular activities, I feel a little empty. Being a freshman I am having to deal with moving away from my family and starting a new life on my own. I finally knew I was grown up when I got my first phone bill! I really enjoy Austin, it has so many things to offer. My mom misses me, we were very close. On sunday I met her in Temple and we talked. My feelings are very strong, but I know how to deal with them. I have had many obsticals in my life and I had to learn from my mistakes. I think in the long run I would not change my past. It made me grow up a lot quicker. I also feel in more mature for my age than other freshman, because of my past expirences. I can not wait to see what the future holds for me. I guess you can say I get really excited about life, because there are so many directions god has allowed me to go. I will just let him guide me, and I know I will be happy and sucessful. "
Tell me about yourself.,"In this short amount of time I changed from a kid who major worries were only about him self. I feel that I have really grow up. I believe it was all the time that I got screwed over by my so called friends. The first time was a the first of my senior year. Well I meet this guy named Kurt and he was from Indian and we shared common interest. However he was new in town and did not have a girl friend. However I was dating this one girl for about year. Well This girl was very possessive, and very wealthy. Not to forget she was beautiful. During the summer I worked as a Life guard and taught swimming lesson in the mornings at her house(made tons of money) Any her family and her left for Europe and had me house sit. No problem making money had a garage full of tool to work on my cars and basically had my own house. I had not friends because they all graduated A year earlier and Cara had been my only friend this past year. Partially because she was so possessive. Well I meet Kurt at the end of the summer and became good friends. He was going to start school with us in the fall and everything was great. Until Cara got home and said not more Kurt. She did the same thing with an early friend Kc. However I finally told her either she relaxes or we break up Decision help by Kurt. So we broke up. So I was dating again. Before Cara I had a new girl friend every two days. Kurt and I were dating these two girl Casi and Lorine. Well Lorine and Kurt started dating and the only thing between Casi and I was a Physical thing so once I stop see her. Lorine influence Kurt in stop hanging out with me. Five months down the road I have and new group of friend they a grade younger than me. They have not had as much luck with the girls as I have so I am letting them meet some of my friends from out of town were a very tight group for about two months when one of the guy in the group named Justin thinks I am having a sexual relationship with a girl he likes. Because she has hickeys on her neck. That same week I had really bad scratch marks on my back not from her. Well he think something is going on and starts a fight with me at school and I break his nose in front of the entire school assembly. Later next week Kurt girlfriend and him break up. So the next day Kurt is at my house. We hang out not stop for about three weeks. Fishing hunting cruising for girl everything, well Lorine wants to get back with Kurt so she brings out this story from way back in the past. (lorine and I were dating a long time ago)  She said that I was inviting her over to my house. Well I was, to a party so she can see Kurt. But she tell I so Kurt gets mad at me and tries to fight me. At my own house during this party. Kurt is a very Muscular guy and very big!!!!. Well I talk it out after we both have black eyes and we have not been close since. Anyway I now dating this really nice sweet girl who is very intelligent and pretty. I just hope it stays as good as it is now. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I used to day dream about  this time when I was younger. After I saw my brother and sister leave for college, I decided that was going to be the best part of my life. Of course, it is a lot different now that I am here. There is a lot more responsibility in reality than there is in my dreams. I don't really mind it so far. I want to be able to handle it, and I am excited about my classes. I wish that I could be an expert in every subject that I take. Psychology is very interesting to me, but not enough to be my major--I wouldn't want to do it for the rest of my life. My brother has a bachelors degree in psychology from Southwest texas, but he hasn't done much with it. I am taking this class as a social science elective; my other classes are required for my major. Right now I am an undeclared major, but after a few classes in my geology of engineering course, I am pretty sure that I want to major in geosystems engineering. It seems to incorporate a large amount of subject material that I am interested in, and it would be a job that pays pretty well. If I did well enough at UT to get into grad school, I would love to follow it up with a masters or Phd in Geology. Of all the courses I have taken in high school and college, these seem to be the best ones. Some of my favorite subjects are: geology, geography, astronomy, archaeology, and history. I would love to be an astronomer in a second if it paid well enough. My reason for this is that eventually I would like to have a large spread of land in the hill country somewhere west of Austin--near a lake--with a boat. This requires $$. I love the outdoors, and I want to live away from the city, yet close enough to it that I could drive into town to do things. This is probably a common ambition among people, but I don't really care. Enough rambling about all that. My reason for being here at UT is to learn, and to get an education, and to do well. If I do all of this I will be very pleased. It will be hard though. I love to have fun, and that can easily get in the way at UT. I haven't joined a fraternity or gone out for rush yet, even though some of my friends who are in frats here keep bugging me. I want to join some organization that has fun and kicks ass at a lot of things. Hopefully that will work out. These are the things that are on my mind at the moment; at least until I move on to the next thing. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Why do we even have computers if they are  so slow and crappy and can't hold more than ""X"" number of people at a time. time. And why can't I put Chip Smart out of business. They sold us a computer that doesn't work worth a crap. We had to replace the sound card and the modem. modem. I am pretty ticked off right at the moment. I don't feel like writing this assignment. I had to buy First Aid 98 to get the new modem to work. It just started working after a long and horrid battle so I am not in the mood for battling for a space on the computer to finish this assignment. Why does this class have to be so complicated in lecture and textbook reading. I don't care about every method in psychology just give me a briefing. I hope you really aren't reading this, because I am in entirely too grumpy of a mood to write anything that makes sense. I can think of nothing else but the immense dislike I have for my computer. I should name it Lucifer. Let me tell you a little about myself. I just got married Aug. 8. Therefore I am thinking about my husband, especially because he just walked in the door of our apartment at Bridge Hollow here in Austin. I miss my father. His birthday was 9-7 and I forgot!!!!!!!  I felt like crying all day. I miss my mother too. Her birthday is coming up in February. (2-5-51)  I truly don't know my father's age. He is older than my mom I know. They divorced when I was 5. After that I guess I lost count. I was adopted  here in Austin at Marywood. I was extremely lucky, because I got the best 2 parents in the whole world!  I truly mean that. I love them. I also miss my brother. He is in the Waco Youth Center right now doing much better. He wants to start working on his career now. He had a hard time with a lot of things, but he sure is strong. He is 3 years younger than me and is learning disabled. He had a hard time in highschool, but let me tell you that when it comes to technical and architectural knowledge, talent and ability, he is awesome. This center will help him get a job at what he is good at and that he will enjoy. Well, as you can probably tell I love my family. More importantly I love God because He sent His son Jesus to die for my sins and because I accept Him, believe in Him, and in return I have given Him my life to use me for His glory. Time is up. "
Tell me about yourself.,"first, it took me a long time to get through the Austin traffic. then, when I got home, and called jenny, she wasn't ready to come over. she came over anyway even though she hadn't shaved her legs. that was kind of bad. next, I still had to deal with the fact that she had messed around with Justin, one of my supposedly good friends. all they did was kiss, but it still really hurt me. she had told me that it would never happen again after she and Kevin messed around, but she lied. I can't believe that she did that. then I told her about the fact that I had sex with heather back during the summer, so she wasn't really happy about that, but that's understandable. I still love her, but she has really putting me to the test this weekend. hen, later on Friday night, she told me that she had liked Justin, so what happened wasn't as much of an accident as I had first thought it was. come to find out, she had gotten drunk at her apartment and then called Justin to come over. that's when the kiss happened. that really hurts me. so she told me that, but she still wanted to have sex with me. I agreed, I don't know why, but I did. and then, in the middle of it, she started crying, that really hurt me. then after that, she told me that she didn't even want me to come with her to college station with her. that tore me apart. I didn't know how to handle it, so I freaked, I just started yelling at her. I don't know why, I should have been more calm , but I just couldn't do it. I tried to calm myself down, but nothing worked. I still can't believe how mean I was. and then, on Saturday morning, I called her, because I thought she was going to leave without calling me like she said she would. and then, she told me that she had changed her mind, and now she didn't want me to go again. then I freaked again. I started yelling at her. I was really hurt, like id never been hurt before. I couldn't believe that anybody could hurt me this bad, but she could do it. s I called Justin, and got a ride with him to college station. it took me an hour and a half to eat my McDonalds lunch. I had lost my appetite. I was miserable. Kenny could see that. I got to a&m, but I had no desire to party, all I wanted to do was talk to jenny so that I could apologize to her for what I said. I ate like half my dinner. it was good but I just didn't want to eat. so, we went to the party, and I was miserable, people were drinking and all I wanted to do was talk to jenny. finally, Kenny gave me the number to Amy's cell phone. so I called it, and Amy wouldn't let me talk to jenny. then Kristen answered and she wouldn't let me talk to her, and then James, her brother wouldn't let me talk to her. I was really hurt. so I got her brothers number from Justin. she had given it to him. that really hurt me, that she gave her  cell phone number to Kenny, and her brother's number to Justin. that devastated me. I just wanted to cry. it just wasn't fair. then Justin called her, and convinced her to come to the party. he handed me the phone, but she really wouldn't say anything to me. I was crushed again. the one thing that I loved more than anything in this life, including myself wouldn't even talk to me. I have never felt so bad. I wanted to crawl in a hole and die, but I couldn't do that, I had to stay semihappy for the party. it was all an act, I was not happy at all. finally, at 1230 she came over. she wouldn't even acknowledge me. her roommates hate me now, and they weren't afraid to let me know. fuck Amy, I hate that bitch. I have never liked her. I just want to beat her fucking head in. she is a stupid dirty whore. I don't care if she hates me, I hate her. I feel bad that cristin hates me. I like her. I really regret saying anything bad about her. then breiane came out and tried to start a fight with jenny. she claimed to be my friend. fuck her. she s a bitch. she acts like a stupid tease. she a dumb tease, she never gives anybody anything. she just likes to pretend like she's a whore. I don't really like her anymore, but it still hurts me that she doesn't want to have a friendship with me. and then, on the way home I got a speeding ticket. oh after I talked to jenny, I got a half-as hug, and then she hugged Justin and didn't want to let go. then she didn't even say good-bye to me. I was hurt again. back to the speeding ticket, it was for 70 in a 30. I'm going to be fucked if my dad finds out. she didn't call me on Sunday like she said she would. that really hurt. I wanted to call her so bad, but I couldn't, I wanted to so bad, not even funny. on Monday, I talked to her for two hours, it was great, we made out. I liked it so much. she didn't call me last night. she called me this morning at 7. it woke me up. I love her, but she hasn't called me tonight yet. I really want to talk to her, so I hope that she calls me tonight. I stayed up to 3 waiting for her last night, then I fell asleep. tonight, I wont make that same choice. I'm going to go to bed early tonight. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am almost five hundred miles from home, and I don't know anyone here. I'm not sure that what I feel is loneliness because I'm constantly surrounded by people here at the dorm, but I just don't feel at home here yet. People here are very nice, and I know everyone else is in the same position as I am in, but I really feel that this place isn't for me. I really want to go home so I can be around the people I grew up with and feel at home with. I have many regrets about coming here away from all my friends and family, but then again, I realize that UT is a great school, and my educational background will be greatly benefited. I suppose it's worth the sacrifices in the long scheme of things. Maybe it is better for me to be here away from everyone else, as it should help me become much more independent and learn how to function alone. I've already learned a lot in the week since I've been here, and I feel that I've grown up a lot. I've had to do everything for myself, and force myself to go out and meet new people. My trust issue has become worse here, however, because I used to trust almost everyone, and now, I'm not sure who to trust and who not to trust. I know that if I can just stick it out for a while that I'll grow to love this place because I love learning and new experiences, and I'm definitely going to get both of those things here at UT. I can always transfer back home next semester if I don't adjust here well. I love the people here because they all seem so friendly. I do feel that I'll eventually make many new friends and this place will seem like home. I cannot sleep or eat here yet. I think it's just the adjustment phase. I have nightmares when I try to sleep, so I've grown accustomed to very few hours of sleep each week. I have no appetite, and every time I try to eat, I get this very sick feeling. I'm seriously hoping both of these feelings will go away soon. Maybe that is just due to being homesick and not being in a place where I feel comfortable yet. I want to go home for the long weekend, but I think that will make it much harder when I come back. I don't think I'll want to leave my home again to return here. Maybe it's just the people I left behind that I miss, but I think mostly it's always knowing someone everywhere I go there that makes me feel comfortable back in my hometown. On top of these things, my ex-boyfriend calls often here, and that makes it very difficult. We're still best friends and tell each other everything. The only reason we're not together now is because of our different college choices, and talking to him makes me want to return home even more. We do plan to get back together as soon as we graduate, but that's a long time from now, and not seeing him often is going to be very hard for me. I've known him for 13 years and relied upon him for everything. I went out with someone else this past weekend, and I felt very bad for it. Even though we're not together, I know that he's the one I want, and I wonder if it's wrong to even date other people if I know I still love him and always will. It's made me feel bad when I talk to him, and I even told him about it. He says it will all be ok, but I just don't know. I'm so confused. There isn't a simple answer to anything I try to do here, and everything I do seems to have some kind of drawback to it. Maybe if I sink myself into my studies, I will not forget, but maybe set aside the hurt that I feel right now. I think I should give that a try, and maybe start a rigorous exercise program so that I will be more tired at night, which might make me get some more rest and increase my appetite a little bit. Maybe I should try to get out of this building. It seems very cold and uninviting, and I think another place might be better for me. Well, I know that with my faith in God that everything will work out for the best if I just put my complete effort into it. It's all for the best! "
Tell me about yourself.,"I've spent my second day at the university of Texas and I'm trying not to hate it. I feel lonely and depressed. I miss Wesley, I miss knowing everyone in my classes and what's going on with the school. when I first went to Wesley I hated how your professorss were so involved in your life, but now I know what the other extreme feels like, I really miss it. I kept looking for a familiar face, or even a friendly on, when I was on campus today. everyone looks different that the people in Boston. actually they all look the same as each other just different form the kind of people I know. I feel alienated and unsure - of myself, of the situation, of what to expect. I can't just look at someone and judge who they are and if I'll like them, because I don't see anyone who fits my idea of what ""friend"" should look like. no one looks like me. it was so good to have lunch with Kate yesterday because I didn't feel so alone and different. she looks like people should- I say that joking of course, but I guess I feel like I can understand her motivations, where she's coming form - I mean I know who she is and it's what I expect. I'm so glad she came here too - I don't know what I would do if I were totally alone down here. I think it's really a different experience for me because I've never not had friends, or had any trouble meeting people, but here I don't even know how to start. there are a million people in most of my classes, and the small ones are upper division, so people already seem to have friends. I didn't expect to miss Wesley so much. I thought it w0ulds be kind of fun to be anonymous, and that there would be a lot more funky people. nearly everyone I've seen is the sorority/frat type and I hate it!  I never thought Wesley was that diverse or funky, but I guess I've realized what I had all along. maybe I'm just remembering things with a rosy glow, or something. I mean I know there are plenty of Wendy Wesley oh-so-perfect women at Wesley who drive me up the wall, but I know how to deal with them. and most of them have at least an open mind, or something interesting that got them to the place where they are now. what else to say?  I just had an argument with my mom and I feel really guilty, I haven't seen her a lot lately and I was really looking forward to seeing her today, but as soon as she started in on about how I should rrahhhh - I hate that. I told her that I was going to use the computer for some web stuff and now she tells me I can't do it, right when I'm in the middle of an assignment. I'm totally annoyed. this just completes my feelings of displacement and loneliness. I'm at acc where I worked this summer and I came here because 1-I have no idea where the computer lab on campus is, and 2- I thought it would be nice to see everyone and feel like I still mattered to someone. now I just feel like hell. I think I want to cry, but I always feel so crappy when I do that - since I usually do it for some really stupid reason, like I feel like a jerk or something. god, I just feel like telling everyone to shove it today!  what a way to start the semester!  ok, I'm trying to think of something a little more cheerful and stop whining. I'm excited about going to the swing dance tonight, but I hope I can. I really want Eric to go, but I'm not sure if I want to want him to go. I hardly know him and he has lots of not-so-great traits. plus, I'm sick of getting hurt. I think I might just like him because he's there and I'm feeling so lonely right now. I don't know if it's right to be with someone just to be with someone. if it's not that serious, would it be that big of a deal?  I'm not sure. I keep going over this in my head - why can't I find the right one?  not the one to marry or anything as serious as that, but one that I really like/  one that fits all the qualifications I want who can entertain and teach me, who's nice and funny and interesting. rrahhh- this is ridiculous. I'm feeling really stress about the time now that she came over, I can't fully concentrate on what I'm thinking about. it's amazing how your mind rambles in loops or something - one thought brings on another and another until you're thinking about something totally different than what started the ramble, and you can't really remember how you got there. "
Tell me about yourself.,"In the past I have always had a set of instructions to follow. On well, here goes. I guess that right now I was back, at the beginning of summer, sitting in my room in El Paso, Texas. This summer was really good. I got to go home and talk with my friends. In addition, I was able to do work and get my history requirement fulfilled. Everyone wants me to go out and get a job. That's okay with me, but I don't really know how to go about getting a good job. You see, I feel that with almost 60 hrs of credit, I should be able to get a decent job. One guy I know is making over 50,000, and he isn't even out of college. I guess it's just easier for some people and not for others. I promised everyone that I would get an internship with a company next summer. That's kind of cool, but it is going to be a completely new experience. I guess I could call up some of my friends who have parents in business and ask them to see if I could get a job with them, but that just wouldn't be good. I want to be able to say, ""here is what I did, and I did it all by myself. "" I know that it's natural to want to get out from under your parent's wing, but it just seems to me that it takes forever. I have been blessed, though. I have done well in school, and fortunately I have a comfortable place to live, food to eat, and clothes to wear. Sometimes it bothers me that I am more preoccupied with which movie I am going to go see this weekend than with more substantive subjects. There are people in this earth who can't even find enough to eat. wow, this is really getting deep. I don't want this to become a ""dear Abby"" kind of assignment, so I guess the best thing to do is to change the subject. I am mildly interested in why this assignment was assigned. I have a certain hesitation when I deal with psychologists and people who are interested in psychology because I always feel like everything I do or say is being evaluated, and that bothers me. Well, I can hear my neighbors (they just turned up their stereo system. )Back to the subject at hand. I am not nearly so stressed this semester like I was last year. I guess that's pretty cool because I am adjusting to the whole college thing pretty well. At least now I know what is going on with this school, this city, and everything else in my life. I by no means have everything figured out, but at least I am not as clueless as I was last year. It is interesting to look around and see the freshman, with the look of panic in their eyes and realize that I was in the exact same predicament a year ago. Since the brother of a friend of mine just moved to Austin and started attending graduate school in engineering, I feel a certain obligation to help him. It is awful to be in the exact same situation without anyone to help. Anyway, the guy is really cool, and I think that a really good friendship will develop. Friendship is something that there is never enough of. Money can't buy good friends, and even though people will try to replace friends with artificial benefits, it just never works. I used to know a man who had loads of money. This guy was really wealthy, but he was never happy. However, if you ever asked him how he was doing, he would never admit that he was unhappy. I guess that is really sad. To be miserable is one thing, but to be miserable and not really know it is something completely different. I think that it is possible to elevate your situation if you are miserable, but I also believe that it constitutes knowing that you are miserable. Rrahhh, my neighbors just turned down their stereo system. Thank God for the little things! I don't really understand why people are always claiming they are depressed. I've been through periods when I feel down, but all I ever do is call my friends, turn on the television to a program I like, go work out, or a host of other things to elevate that situation. I don't believe that 10% of Americans need to be on Prozac, or some other drug which makes you feel better. Oh, well. I guess the only thing that I can do is change my own destiny. Even though it scares me, it is kind of cool. I see so many people who are in a rut, and it makes me feel like their lives are hopeless. I know that changing is hard. I don't really like to change. However, it always seems that when I do, it is for the better. Of course, there are those times when you change, and it proves to be a change for the worse. That only goes to reinforce your opinion that changing is wrong and you shouldn't do it. I believe that a person should experience all the things life has to offer at least once. That way they can say that they've done it. In addition, they'll know what it is. You know, I always feel awkward when I am in a conversation that turns stale. (I. e. the kind of conversation where no one really knows what to say. ) That really is bad. It seems like I have been in too many of those type of situations. I don't really know what the future has in store for me, but I am both excited and apprehensive. It is easy to look back on my past and think that those days were the glory days when everything was easy. Unfortunately, those days proved to be no different than today. Is that the way it always is? Your memory improves memories as time goes on? If so, I can understand how the past was so alluring and appealing to many people. I know a couple people who only want to reminisce about how good the past was and how awful the present is. That's pretty sad. I think that they need to start living today for what it is worth. That's what I try to do. I guess my 20 minutes are up. This was kind of an interesting experiment, but I am not entirely sure what the results are. I don't really know myself, and I don't know if it is possible to know yourself. There are so many different facets and sides to me that it would drive a person crazy to try to document them. I can't even do it. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Very rarely do I  just sit down in front of a blank screen and start writing without having any idea where my words are going. At this point, I'm really wishing that I could get some peace and quiet. I've always lived in an extremely quiet house and I guess I took the peacefulness for granted. However, despite the occasional clash between my study and the party in my room, I have no complaints about the present state of my life. I'm heading home this weekend, and while I've only been in Austin for about two weeks, I feel like this is home now. My house is just like some place I visit on occasion. I can't decide whether its a good thing that this change in my life doesn't bother me or whether its a bad thing. Either way. what are you going to do. I am just completely blanking on what to write about. Anything that is running through my mind would take too long to explain and I don't usually tell stories about myself anyway. For an arbitrary subject, I guess I'll write about my best friend. She goes to A&M and I will be seeing her in about a week for her sister's wedding. It seems strange to be her without her. We talked everyday in highschool. Four years. that's a long time. However, I don't feel like our relationship has suffered at all because of the distance. I always believed that once you got to see what is inside the center the someone, what makes them tick, what makes them unique, then the relationship never ends. Because, what is inside someone never changes. All of the stuff we put on for show, that changes, but not what's inside people. I am looking forward to the wedding though, because it feels like I haven't seen her in a long time.    O. K. Second arbitrary topic. Dating. I am really looking forward to dating  in college. I mean there are about 25000 new girls wandering around here, and at least some of them are bound to be interesting. However, it is a bit strange to think about dating because its only about month since I broke up with my last highschool girlfriend. Damn, it is so hot in this room. Well, my ex-girlfriend. that subject is going no where. I guess I have a tough time talking about the past. I always figured that everyone distorts there versions of the past. Memories are either viewed through rose-colored glasses or blinders. I'd rather think about what I'm doing right now. Memories are nice on occasion, but as with anything else, you can over-indulge in them. What's really foremost in my mind right now is making good grades and not losing my social life or mind in the process. I really don't think that will be too difficult though. When you study something you enjoy, then its not really work. Instead of draining your energy, it gives you more energy. New things to learn, new things to strive for. I love it. I really have no clue how long I've been writing, but I assume I'm pretty close to 20 minutes. Mental note to self:  pick up new Pat Green CD for dad tomorrow and call Angela. Well, this is my stream of consciousness. Its not a deep stream but damn it its mine. To end I will remind myself of some sayings a very wise man said once:  Never play poker with a man named Doc. Never eat at a place called Mom's. Never date a woman with a tattoo of a dagger anywhere on her body. Never try to teach a pig to sing. it stresses you out and annoys the pig, and finally, the ultimate truth in the universe:  frogs have and always will whomp their asses every time they jump. Thank you ladies and gentlemen. Be sure to tip your waitress. Good Night!      "
Tell me about yourself.,"In high school I felt smart. Now I just am a face lost in the crowd. There are so many peole-so unfamiliar. What will I do?  All my friends went to different colleges. The only new people I know are my roomates-and they all have friends from high school to hang with. I feel like an outcast, like an ugly, fat, freshman, high schoolish girl. Even in my pledge class, all the other girls know each other from camp or home or watever. I have made friends though. I feel like my story is a depressing one, but I really am a happy person and I am enjoying college-being away from home. I thought that coming to college I would somehow escape the whole social thing. Obviously there is no escaping society. I was a Debutante, Neches River Festival Grand Lady-in-waiting, Senior Class Vice-President, and so much more. I was shown in the ""higher"" society. I hated it some, I liked it some. I guess I mainly liked the in control feeling and the attention. I went to public school, not private like most all of the people who came here from Beaumont, so I really am not friends with mopst of the people I know. The girls I know-from home and in my pledge class-all live in Hardin House. I live in Towers. There again, I feel like an outcast. I feel that somehow these girls look down on me. It seems like all the girls from Hardin house are all so close-and I am not allowed to be a part of their ""group. ""  Sometimes I just want to go home and be with my friends-where I felt I belong. I am excited to be in college, but-now I'm crying-but anyway, I just feel too young. But going home would show a weakness-I can't go home-I can't show that I want to or have an interest. I have always been the strong hard-headed type that doesn't show emotions. I was sick of being at home-I like it here, but it's hard-school that is. I want to do good in school and show my parents and grandparents-that I am a worthy person and I can survive-on my own. I really am happy, but I guess it is just cold feet. It is just going to take some time to adjust and become a sociable person, again. I know I can do it-make my grades and everything-even if it means giving up a party, or two or ten. I will make it and I will succeed. I am forever changing and growing up, but I need to find who I am -as an individual and on my own rather than hide behind the shadow of my comfort zone. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I 'm doing this because for the first time all night my modem got out og dobve without the number being busy. I spent the whole night doing homework as well as most of the day. I'm really hungry right now which sucks because no pllace is open right now. I'm really happy I got bakc with my girlfriend last night. I went thrugh what I'd call semi depression during our breakup. I lost 20 lbs in 2 weeks and would eat maybe one snack cake per day. I was really forlorn. I cut all my facial hair, which took me 2 weeks to grow. I got  a short note from her last week saying she wanted to get bcak to gether. I called her talked and on Sunday night we went to Creed. / It was one of the best concerts I've seen I n a long time. I think I might buy that CD. Jeesze I'm starving. I  wish I could get a bite to eat. I have to be up a 7:10 tomorrow f or class, That really sucks that I havce to gfet up every morning at 7 while my roommate sleeps till noon. Its not faiR! I think I'jll call Leah ukp tomorrow. I haven't talked to her since Sunday. I miss her. It's pretyy cold in my room right now. Last night it was freeszing. My roommate brought over  his friend and wastched Pollitically INcorrect while I was trying to study how rude. She was disgustingly overweight. She desperatley needs to go on a diet. I saw this really fat guy at the concert last night. Weighted at least 500lbs. I hope he didn't take off his shirt during the middle fo the show otherwise that'd be gross. I'm getting sick of  listening to Pearl Jam and I 'm gettting really tired. Maybe I should skip my early class tomorrow. I was fine this mornign and around 5 I started becoming really drowsy. I don't understand how I can always be tired at 5-6 but then take 3 hours before I fall asleep. Well I'm going to bed. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I know so many people already, but I don't feel as that I have made that many close friends. I spent a lot of time deciding whether or not to join a fraternity, and ultimatley decided not to, and now I wonder if this was the right idea. I tried to think of both all the positive advantages and negative disadvantages of joining a frat, and came to the conclusion that it would be too time consuming. But now I see a lot of my peers invloved with Greek organizations, and they seem to be having a lot of fun. All of my room/suitemates are in frats, so they talk about it and go to their activites all the time. I do not know if I made the right decision, but there is nothing I can do now because the pledge period has already started. I will have to make the best of my situation, but I am confident and hoping that it will work out. I have some very close friends fromm my hometown of Fort Worth who are not in fraternities, so I plan on hanging out with them a lot this semseter. To find worthwhile activites, I plan on joining some student organizations and Jewish groups. I am excited about all the people here at UT, and sometimes feel intimdated about everything that is going on (especially since at my dorm, Univeristy Towers, a majority of the residents go Greek and they are always doing something). I am an optomistic person though, and I will do anythign and everything I can to have a successful and enjoyable year in school and in Austin. I am worried about a growing threat of religious fundamentalism in the world, and not only in the United States. This month, an Islamic ultranationalist group bombed two U. S. embassies in Africa. This same group has vowed to destroy the State of Israel, which is very scary to me and for all Jewish people throughout the world. Osama Bin-Laden, leader of the terrorist group, supports and financially funds Hamas, a Palestinian terror organization and Hezbollah, a Lebanese terrorist group as well, and has the support of many Muslims in the Middle East. He is very popular, and will do whatever it takes to achieve his goal- the immeidate ""Liberation of Palestine from Zionist aggression"" as he calls it, or ""total annihilation and massacrre of the free people in the secular, democratic, peace-loving State of Israel"" as I see it. He sees Israel as a hostile nation which should be removed from the world map. As all intelligent people know, Israel is a peace seeking country that respects the rights and liberites of all its inhabitants, regardless of religion. Bin-Laden has growing support of his movement from his radical fundamentalist supporters, and they are the ones responsible for commiting these terrorist acts throughout the world. For instance, this week he was probably behind a nail bomb which expoded in Tel Aviv, injuring and killing many. Also, Pakistani radicals this week announced plans to overthrow the secular government and instill a new parliament based on Islamic religious law. In poor Middle East countries, where starvation and poverty are extremely high, people having nothing positive to look forward to, so they turn to fundamentalsim. The same movement is happening right here in the United States. Some religious fundamentalist leaders, like Pat Robertson and Ralph Reed, are calling for mandatory school prayer and the inclusion of religion into public instituition. It is their intention to make the United States a Christian nation by passing legislation in favor of the religious right, which happens to be WRONG. The founders of our country included a seperation of church and state clause into the Constitution for a purpose, and that was to keep America a secular nation. The radical right wing is trying to change this very core of our country. Learning fundamentals might be good in athletics, but preaching religious fundamenalism is a dangerous threat to all of society. I commend freedom seeking nations like the United States and Israel for doing their part to combat this worldwide problem, which if not stopped will affect everyone in a very horrific manner. "
Tell me about yourself.,"In the summer I had a surgery on my shoulder and currently I am in therapy. The pain I am experiencing right now is pretty bad. I am an athlete and I am used to bear with pain. But all the pain I have had before was relatively voluntary. I am also very anxious to get to my normal daily training. My body is screaming for training. But my body is not a problem, my problem is my soul and mind. I really miss diving and I want to come back and kick everybody's ass. I am also anxious to start studying. I am looking forward into this semester and I like my classes. I feel very excited about school and want to get great grades this year. That's all that I think about at the moment. I am home sick and I want to go home. I can go home for Christmas but I want to go right now. I want to be with my family. I have not seen my family for over a year and I really miss them. I want to be with my friends and see them every day. They are all at home in Russia and I can not wait to see them again. Some of them had babies recently and I want to see them as well. I have known my friends for 10 years and we are very close to each other. I hope I will see them soon.     "
Tell me about yourself.,"In fact I always think about her whenever I have a spare moment. She is in my every thought. She is so far away from me, yet in my heart she is so close. I read some poetry tonight, Love Sonnets, and all I could think about was her. She is so beautiful. I long for the next time I can see her. It seems like only yesterday we met for the first time. I talk about her constantly to all my friends to the point, where they are either sick of hearing about her, or know her almost as well as I do. I know it's not the best thing to go through, but I am seem to be sad all the time. Not literally, or maybe literally, but it is hard to explain. I love her more then life itself, but I ""hate"" her for leaving me. Not really hate, but I don't know how to explain it, but more like I guess a little dislike. Nothing I can't handle, I just wish she was here with me. It doesn't seem fair. I see all of my friend's with their significant others, and they are next to each other always. Sharing all the ""special"" moments in their lives, but I have to wait at least a week, before I can call her. The bill is too expensive otherwise. I beg her to come back, knowing full and well, that she can't do that, but it seems to help but sometimes hurt at the same time. She is so special to me, and I can wait forever for her. Most people think that is absurd, but she is my everything. Being sad a lot I know is to a degree not healthy, but what can I do. The moment she walked down the corridor in the airport, I heart stopped smiling. Since that gloomy day in June, a part of me has been gone. Although I smile on the outside, on the inside I am sad. The day her sweet embrace takes me in, only then can I smile. That day is not too far away, and I long for it. I guess this is the best part of being sad, because I feel better thinking about the future, the only thing is that it is a type of perpetual loop. As soon as I think about the future and being with her, I get sad again thinking that I have to wait another few months. Then I think about all the times that I will be ""alone"" without her. As much as my friends are great, I have none really. She is my one and only TRUE friend. I have some friends, I. e. my roommate, and a several other people that genuinely care, but most of them don't. I have pretty much stopped ""trying"" to be there as much as I have in the past. I feel that I am only a friend in the convenience of someone else. I feel that they only come to talk to me when they need something, or when something is wrong for them. I used to try so much, but in the past month's I have stopped trying. That may not be the answer, but it is something that I have come to. I tell all my friends that if they do need me, then I will be there for them. I called to see how my friends were. I paged them telling the just a simple ""hello"". Calling them randomly just to check if everything was cool. And that favor was never really returned. So, now I don't care as much. I am still there if someone needs me. I could NEVER abandon a friend. I care too much about people for that. All of this leads me back to my girlfriend. She is the one person that ALWAYS cares about how I am feeling. She always knows when something is wrong or bothering me. She always wants to take care of me and love me. And for that I return the feelings back 10x over. I love her and I don't want anything ever to happen to her, so I check with her as much as I can. She is some kind of special and I can't let her go. She is too good to me. It's moments like these where I get to feel better about my situation, because I know everything will be fine in the ""end"", but at this moment in my life, I am not so much worried about the ""end"" as the now. Maybe worried isn't the best word. I just wish she was here to spend time with me. So we could eat dinner together, go see a movie together, to study together, to love together. All the couple things and all the friend things. It just seems unfair, and then there are points like now, where I miss her like crazy and I think I am going to go nuts without her. I know I can be strong and I can surpass this and the end will be that much sweeter. So with that in mind, I can end this ""journal"" entry on a good note and feel good about everything. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I thought I would because I've visited with my friends so many times before, but now that I'm actually here it's finally true. I'm away from my parents, it's so great. I live with three great girls in my suite and we're so popular here. I've always been a socially outgoing person, but now I feel like it's going to work. there are always large numbers of people in our living room, bringing in food or beer to contribute to our refrigerator; everyone munches from it. and it's OK. the RA told us about this girl in another room who got so upset because her roommate ate her store bought cookies without asking; she called her mom and was so upset. I'm so glad its not like that here. we all contribute and all consume. But it's not like there's always noise and party's here. only when we all decide. if one person wants to read or study or sleep, we're really considerate. I hope that lasts, I'm pretty sure it will. At our building there are many foreign exchange students which is always a plus because, come on, who minds a foreign accent every once in a while. this guy from Belgium and this one from England are always watching TV in our room, which is another amusing thing: we don't have cable, or an antenna, or a VCR, so we only get FOX Channel 7. We sit around and watch whatever's on. in one way it's good because we don't have arguments over which channel to watch. maybe simplicity is  the root of compromise. We had a floor meeting the other night here and they discussed some issues that had come up. it was so funny because almost all of them referred to our room's shananagans. This one guy came here from where he lives in a house to use the laundry (he's one of our friends- our referring to my roommate and I we've been friends since 2nd grad, long time, huh? ) anyway, he dropped like half a box of laundry detergent on the stairwell and no one noticed for a week. the RA got mad and cleaned it up herself, but it was amusing because he doesn't even live here. another thing was the ""stolen furniture"" incident. we are given this loveseat-type couch in our suite's living room that can maybe seat 3 people if you're lucky. and in the lobby of the 3rd floor in front of the elevator there are 2 large couches that just block the pathway, no one ever sits in them, and they could probably seat 5 or 6. so when no one was around, my suitemate and I and 3 other people that happened to b in our room at the time helped us move our dinky little couch into the lobby which is down the hall and around a corner. we hauled the large couch down the way and we had to tilt it sideways and temporarily knock off some of the ceiling tiles just to make it in the doorway without banging down the door across from us. now we have a nice couch that is well used and the RA's are threatening to do a room check to find it. why?  its going to more use. It's all kind of a double standard anyway. The head RA is always in our room hanging out and drinking our beer. he has a crush on me so he always brings us stuff and won't mention the couch to the others and lets us into the cafeteria at night. it's pretty funny, one night the night guard knocked on our door because someone had made a noise complaint. we opened the door and the guard stood in the threshold and the head RA stood behind the door quietly while we got reprimanded. it probably wouldn't have been in his best interests to b seen in there. He's only 20, but the building is changing management, so right now he's the head guy. its odd. I'm 18. finally. I could be in a management position at the pool I lifeguard at in the summers, next summer. it seems odd that I'm really an adult. when you're a kid u never think that you're ever going to get to the point where you decide when to come home and when to do this and what to do in this situation, type thing. its like the transition from high school to college really is that much of a change in that you're independent. it feels so good to finally b independent, financially, physically, emotionally. its wonderful responsibility. I am responsible for watching my budget, if I don't, no one will bail me out (well that's probably not true but you know). I guess I'm trying out freedom on borrowed wings, I can always have that security blanket if I want, but I don't want. I want to be independent. I am right now, I hope to stay that way "
Tell me about yourself.,"Today I had a very fun (sarcastic) schedule, I worked out and also participated in my NROTC drill team, which I am a part of. My thoughts are nothing but satisfaction, a vigorous week of PT (physical training), academics, drill, and discipline have finally ended for three glorious days to elapse. Yes, just another three days or so, then it's back to the normal vigorous routine. My feelings for joining the NROTC unit is my decision, the option to choose the path to become a Marine Corps commissioned officer is brave for my part. For the past week, PT has been vigorous and I sometimes find myself out of shape for the activities. My ankle, which has a long history of spraining, is not helping either. My Gunnery Sergeant and my Staff Sergeant and I agreed that the Leathernecks, the ""Marine Corps"" part of the team, will help me get up to standards, after all, the Leathernecks and the entire unit looks after its own. Looks after it's own. I want to be part of the team, a part of the unit, a player, a leader, not a manager, not a weakling, nor any of that. I want to prove that I am someone. That I am a human being, someone worthy of being respected and liked. I have had a couple of bad experiences before I reported to UT. One was that I broke up with my girlfriend for the summer. She and I, even though we liked each other, found out that we were 'incompatible' and the separation of college (me going to UT, she going to U of H) would only make things worse. Sometimes we would find ourselves arguing over something as petty as 'who left the door open?'. It was a bad experience and the breakup just before college hit me like a MACK truck, just like all my bad experiences before. After my breakup, I wonder whether I should date again. There's a nice girl (I won't name her name or how I know her) around that I know but I don't know if I should get to know her more. Maybe it's because I had a bad history of dating, and I sometimes wonder if I would take the circle path back to where I started, broken up and feeling depressed about myself. This girl, I like her a lot, and I  think she thinks I'm ok, but I don't know if she really likes me. To take another risk like that will probably leave me either being shunned my rejection or being depressed by another break up. That's why I must concentrate on other things. My priority is to the team, and I will work as much as I can to get my unit up and running. I am in the pistol and the drill team and I want to learn more and know more. Also, I want to get a 4. 0 GPA, so I can get a scholarship from my unit. PT has been tough, I find myself being killed by the active duty Marines when we PT, but I can't quit. My ankle had me forced to drop out of the runs two times, but I won't quit the program. I cannot quit, and I will not quit. To quit will put me forever in disgrace as a quitter who couldn't 'hack it' and also in the shun of my teammates, who I left them high and dry by letting them down. To quit would also to put me down further into the downward spiral of depression. To quit is out of the question. I will keep on going no matter what happens and I will do anything that has to be done to pass. I will not fail.                 "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am happy that I made the transition from Georgia Tech to UT. I am cautious about my future and what I want to get involved in. I want to become a Texas Wrangler but I am unsure that they will take me. I want to do well in school and get in to law school. I don't study as much as I want to, and I need to work on that. I love sports and I like football most of all. I wish I had played football was a kid. I am excited about the future of our country and I want to get involved. I don't understand what this assignment is about, but I will write everything that is on my mind. I worry a lot about stuff that is of no concern to me. I try to be the best student and person that I can be. I have a lot of pressure on me from my past and the way I have been raised. I've always been a good student and pretty athletic, and I try to be the best at everything. I knew that is bad, but I feel that that is the way I was born. I believe our President is guilty and should be impeached for the good of the nation. He is a smart man, but he is personally corrupt. I have a roommate that is good. He is Norwegian and is a great student. He is fun to hang out with and we get along well. I have a girlfriend and I'm not sure if we should stay together. We get along well, but I feel like I have the whole world at my fingertips, and she is holding me down. ,  WE share a lot together and we are best friends, but she wants more. more time, more money. etc. My parents are strong Christians, but ?I am not sure that that is what I want. College is a time to figure all of this out, and I am glad I am here. It is a fun place and the knowledge here is overwhelming. I am like a sponge trying to get it all in my head. I want to be an attorney and I feel like al the knowledge will make me a better lawyer. I want to be the best that I can be and make a good future for myself. My Mom never went to college so she wants me to make the most of it. It is a lot of pressure from her, and I try to be a role model for my younger brother. He is a trouble maker, and I want to be a positive influence in his life. He is a good kid, but the friends he is with are not good for him. I love my family very much. I can't wait for the UT UCLA football game. I love the game and I love the school spirit it provides. I was an engineering major at Georgia Tech last year and I made the switch to UT all by myself. I am proud of that move, and I wouldn't have it any other way. It was the best move I've ever made. I like the big school here and the number of students here. I want to run for public office when I get older and make this country a better place. I feel like I can be a good leader and bring good things to this country. I am a good person, and I believe others will think so too.  "
Tell me about yourself.,"I honestly have no earthly idea. I just woke up about 2 hours ago. Drop off my younger sister at her school, which is my old high school. My boyfriend is still a senior there. At times it is awkward going there but at the same time very comfortable. I brought my (old) teacher  a lot of buckets for the upcoming carnival for the little kids. I enjoy bringing her to school 1, because I remember how horrible bus rides were. So I never rode it. Actually I rode it 2yrs in middle school, because my mom could not drop me off. And secondly I get to see my Bert. It is weird being in a relationship, not because it is uncomfortable. More like it is a different experience. I never really had a relationship until my senior year. It really isn't hard balancing my priorities. My number one priority is finishing school. Hey, I realized that my typing isn't as bad as I thought. I still have to look at the keys at times. Back to Bert. He really is an extremely wonderful person, cute, good husband material( not that I am thinking about that right now) It's just that it really is hard to find someone genuinely nice and sincere to everyone, and especially you. I think it just sucks that he is my first true relationship. Because, the old notion that the first most likely isn't the last. Only time will tell. It's about 10:02 and I didn't go to work today. Instead, I am doing this lovely assignment. Excuse my typing, I am not that good. Oh, I know what else I am thinking. My big 18 B-Day is coming up, and my dad is still holding strict control over me. Like I am twelve all over again. He doesn't realize that I am growing up and staying home this year doesn't help. Although, I love my home and mother. I only wish certain straining attitudes would alter. My first class today is math 305G. oh, boy! My teacher is actually, pretty nice. Right now it  is much more of a review, and my homework assignment is due today also. There were only actually a few problems that I quite couldn't recall. I just have to practice on more problems. I am not at all surprised of my needed review. The problems were wonderful word problems which I have never seemed to master without practice. Well look here it is three minutes past my 20 minutes. and these people are becoming a little antsy (I think that is how you spell it) about time limits. Oh, if you actually do read any parts of these assignment  I HOPE YOU ARE READING THIS BECAUSE I JUST WAS THINKING THAT YOUR CLASS IS ACTUALLY ENJOYABLE. AND I HOPE TO MEET ONE DAY NEXT WEEK, INSTEAD OF BEING A NUMBER IN YOUR 50000000 PERSON CLASS. (JUST A LITTLE PLAY WITH NUMBERS) Adios, till we meet again for the next writing assignment. Which I'll do tomorrow, because we can't do 2 in one day. Bye                            WRITING ASSIGNMENT 1                             433613201 "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm pretty happy with my first week and a half of classes. I've met a lot of people. It means a lot to me. I am a very quiet, sort of shy person. I was afraid of coming to UT because I'm not the best at making friends. So far though, it hasn't been a problem. My big classes have been a little intimidating because of there size. I used to have classes about 30 or less. Right now I am happy, UT won its first football game. I'm glad I was able to go. It was lots of fun. Now I feel a little exhausted. I haven't really done all that much today. I actually got to sleep for 12 hours last night. I could be exhausted because I am hungry. I think I'm pretty lucky. My parents sent me some food. My brother brought it to Austin. He and I will share it. I'm already starting to miss home-cooked meals. I think my 20 minutes are just about up. I probably fix a bite to eat, watch a little T. V. and go to sleep. "
Tell me about yourself.,"at this point I am very unsure of what exactly to do or where my direction for the future is. My paranoia that I developed from living in ny has certainly overcome my life as everyday is almost a struggle at times to go on because I so easily find something to mess it up. I feel as if everything is always ready to go wrong, so I guess I need a more optimistic view of my life so I don't have to have negative beliefs everyday that ruin a perfect day.  I guess I am also questioning whether I belong in Austin or if I should return to NYC and transfer to nyu business school. I will need a 4. 0 both semesters which will be close to impossible for myself in order to stay here. in addition I also wonder if I belong here and if I can fit in with everyone else. they are all nice to me but I just wonder if I can fit in and if they are all being fake to me behind my back, not that I don't already have to deal with that in ny. if it were not for people I could trust like Reid or Jason or a very few others than I don't think I could make it here. I am very surprised to find how certain people have just drifted away and its like I make an effort and they don't even care about it. I just feel that sometimes things are not any better here than in ny and if it came down to the two I would probably just go back to NYC.   NYC has a very special importance to me. I feel in a weird way that I can fit in there and it is my real home. to have the opportunity to live there for college and party all the time is really exciting, although I wonder if it would be the right choice to go back east since I was so miserable there. Danielle is the only person who I can count on and maybe even Nicole if I was not so pissed at her for going out with mike, but then again maybe that is my fault. if I wasn't so flirty and actually expressed my feelings than maybe it could have worked a lot better, but then again I always find someway to screw things up as usual which always haunts me at every task or thing now because I go in with such a negative attitude all the time. hopefully I can have another positive year like last time and it will help me be more confident. In the mean time I really need to focus on new goals and establish myself more positively:       1. get a 4. 0 average so I have the opportunity to stay if I want to but keep all transfers in mind especially nyu or something in the Boston area in case I feel the need to leave.    2. keep working out and getting big - competition is tough and I have to compete with you know who so I feel as if I must keep on going and hopefully it will work and I will look decent for once in my life - I also need to stay healthy and I need, I want a 6 pack by years end if it kills me      3. work on being social despite my physical problems and hopefully I will win out with whatever way it goes      4. help your community out and help others - remember you have been bad and need to fulfill certain things because the lord put me here for a reason and I want to be helpful and give happiness to others since I am not happy at least     Remember to keep it real and tight  . CAN'T NOBODY HOLD ME DOWN!!!!  I CAN'T STOP! I WON'T STOP! I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO STOP!   ) "
Tell me about yourself.,"She kind of put me in a depressed mood for the passed few days because she started telling me that she often writes her dad in trying to make her feel better, and it does,  It kind of put things into perspective for me because I wouldn't know what I would do in her situation. well now that I am back in Austin I try to  work hard  and try to get thing s like this off my mind. not that I necessarily want to  because  that   would be bad. well now the people I am with right now are bothered because I am using their computer and I don't want them to see what I am typing, I usually feel this way with anything I do, I don't like any one seeing or reading g anything that I  write, do, or accomplish   the  time isn't really going by to fast right now . I have so much in my head put can't think about it right now. I am a  strange strange  person. everyone always tells me that because I always hold back my thought and when I want to let them out my mind draws to a blank. it gets me frustrated, good thing that I work out to work off my frustration. the life is tough, that is what my dad always says, and it is. I don't know how he made it here and have 5 kids have successful lives. my parents have done a good job, they really have. but know in trying to give so much more than they had it's hurting them financially and I feel that me going off to college is putting an even bigger debt in their pocket book. But they tell me not to worry about so I tell them not to worry about me, I also tell them  that if anyone is going to go in debt it's going to be me. let me pull out the loan s in my name let me do all that I   will   be able to take care of it in the long run. right now I'm just tired of being a burden I know what I have to do and  I am going to do it. I have done this type of assignment before, I once turned it in as a paper, and my teacher loved it, it was more in the structure of  a poem, it ended being about 20 pages long and my teacher said it was outstanding, and nobody even believed me when I said that I was going to turn in that abstract paper and they didn't believe me when I  told them that the teacher actually liked it. and that is 20 minutes. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I come from a small town of 5,ooo people and everyone knows your business. I have 4 sisters and 0 brothers. I am the 2nd to the youngest person of all 5 girls. All 3 of my older sisters are married  except for my youngest one. She is only in the 6th grade. My father is a elementary school teacher and my mother is a pharmacist technician. I love my parents to death and they have been for me continuously. I respect with all that I have to offer and much more. I hope to do well in school, not only for myself but for them as well. I hope to go to medical school one day and eventually be doctor. I have high expectations of myself and I hope to accomplish all of my goals. I know that I am the only one that can mess up my life and my goals. I have this roommate, and I worry about him every now and then. He seems to know what he wants but, he keeps on screwing up. I have this friend who has to do homework. She would have been done by now but  she is a huge procrastinator. I can be like that too, but I work better under pressure. A lot of people tell me that I do not have common sense, but I really don't give, because I don't care. As you can see, I am writing whatever is coming to my mind. I wish I could just type the same word over and over again. For example,---- say etc. Sometimes I wonder what the world will be like in about 20 years. if it is even going to be here or if we are not. Huh. About what. Oh man hey one of you'll do me a favor, nah I need a big favor. I am not going to pull your finger. No for real I need you'll to do me  a favor. It depends. Will you'll go pick up Erica?  Yah, if you give me few bucks. Well, I really don't know what to type anymore, I have been typing a whole bunch of crud and now my twenty minutes are up or at least almost up. I have paused for a while, but that is only because it is hard just writing what ever comes to your mind. so I won't lie, but It has been an experience. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I just ate and am full. I feel a little stressed trying to write in a flow and finding enough things to write for 20 mins. This is probably one of the strangest things I've ever had to do but that's why this class is so interesting  I'm so excited to major in it. I'm having a bad morning, because I slept late and now I feel that my whole day is ruined. It's so weird to be doing homework like this, I guess I'm just not used to this. I'm so glad this class is so different. I also love philosophy too. I really feel like sleeping right now, however my scholastic obligations are more important right now. This is such a pivotal moment in my life, as I embark on college life. Right now I'm actually very proud of myself for getting all of my studies taken care of, rather than succumbing to sleep, as every college student would like to do. I feel like my roommate is really impressed with me as I click away at this computer so concentrated and intent on this assignment. I'm having trouble concentrating because the phone keeps ringing, and Riana keeps talking on the phone. I get distracteed very easily, and am not good at concentrating while there are distractions about. Right now I'm getting irritated, because she is always on the phone with her boyfriend and I cannot concentrate. She's always with him, and I can't be with mine because he lives in college station, and I'm sad because were growing apart, and I can't stop it from happening, and I'd really like to. He's so perfect, but I'm beginning to think there's more out there, and that gives me a terrible feeling inside, because I love him so much, and he's my best friend in the world, and the last thing I want to do is hurt him, so I may just lay a passive role in the relationship until I can settle things in my mind. I feel so odd confiding in a perfect stranger like this, but then again no one may ever read this. I have so many confusions and distractions here. My friend is getting screwed over by a guy who keeps telling me he's in love with me. I loved this guy as a friend,  but I've lost so much respect for him, by the way he's playing games with my friend's head. I got my first speeding ticket yesterday, and surprisingly, the only thing I was upset about was the fact that I have to ruin a Saturday in defensive driving. This assignment wears you out-my fingers are aching. I'm really worried that when I finish this and press submit, it won't submit, because I accidentally pressed it before, and at the bottom of my computer screen it says done. My very first assignment , and I've probably already messed it up. I guess I'll have to explain the problem to the professor, and hope he understands that I've never used the internet before, and I am an idiot for messing up. well I guess I'll end on this paranoid note, because I really want to do well, and make a 4. 0 this semester. No one believes me, but I have high hopes and determination, and I won't let them bring me down. Well I guess I didn't end on such a bad note after all, but if that's what you need to make it, then I guess I'll end up ok after all "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am twenty-two years old and I still have apprehension towards computers. I don't really know why. I guess it is because of my lack of experience with them. I am also worried about the pre-testing. I tried to access the site but it would not let me connect. My boyfriend just told me that he thinks it is stupid that a class is relying on computers so much. At first I agreed with him, but as I am typing this, I am beginning to think that it is sort of cool. Speaking of my boyfriend, he is currently in his kitchen heating up  leftovers. I can smell them and it makes me sick to my stomach. Oh well, I will get acclimated. I have something on my mind. But first I would like think about my day and my new major. Well, I changed my course of study, but not really. For the past two years I have been in the school of architecture. I love buildings and I love to design. I sacrificed a lot to get into the school and not to mention adding on three extra years to my college life. It was such a major decision. Well, I just entered into a new course of study, it is architectural interior design. The interior design program moved into the school of architecture so they beefed up the program and gave it prestige. Back to my boyfriend. I feel like I had an emotional affair with his best friend. That really sucks. I can't seem to get the other guy out of my mind. I am even having dreams about him. I e-mailed him today. It was a big step "
Tell me about yourself.,"of course maybe today is a good day because I am feeling such a flood of emotions at the moment. and this will probably be a good release, you know? I don't know I have been kind of down lately. maybe it is this new university environment. I'm having difficulty adjusting I guess. it's all kind of overwhelming. too many things at once. I really wanted to call mauricio and talk about what happened in Mexico. stuff that shouldn't have happened between us, but it did nonetheless and it really shouldn't have but I am also kind of glad in a way that it did. but instead of calling him like I wanted too I called randy. I hadn't talked to him for three weeks I guess. I want to talk to him about what happened in Mexico also, but I can't. I just can't. it would just cause more unneeded problems I am afraid. so I called him, he was a bad mood as usual lately. I had already been feeling poorly lately and talking to him while he was in that mood wasn't such a good idea it's just that he is one of my best friends and I want to know what is going on in his life. I realize he is having a hard time right now, but he I don't know. I just wish he was more excited to talk to me or something. instead he just upsets me more, and that on top of everything else just makes me cry. crying is a good release though. but I didn't want to. so being like that I wanted to call mauricio even more and sort out some things with him so that would be one less overwhelming thing to deal with right now, but I agree with Andrea and think I should wait for him to call me. but I don't know if I am going to be able to. but I will try. I called my step-mom instead. she immediately knew something was wrong with me. I really miss my mom. Venezuela, my friends, the life I had there. it was so great looking back on it. but I don't want to think that the best years of my life have already passed, I want to think that future holds so much, that I have so much to look forward to. I believe I do I just need to get past this emotional slump I have been in. but it is kind of difficult. I really miss mauricio. I wish he were here in Austin. I feel like right now he is the one I should talk to about everything. I wish I knew how he felt, I just wish he would call me. Christi, thinks I should go and buy a new telephone cable among doing other things. she thinks that if I had regular internet access I would be a whole lot happier. it's not that I not happy. I don't want to be a depressed person, I want to be a happy responsible in-control person. not a sad depressed one that no one want s to be around. I don't think I am usually. I just am in a bad situation lately I guess. I am letting too many things get to me and drag me down. I need to focus on what is important and do one thing at a time. and not get so overwhelmed. I think going home next weekend will be a good break for me as well. I didn't think that I would miss it so much, but I do. a lot actually. I just want to feel my normal comfort level. to know what is going on, although I do not want to be in high school. I just want to be able to I don't know be normal. I thought I would be here, but I am not. I don't know how people do it. how they cope. I think I am lot weaker than I thought. I don't mean that. I don't know what I think. I think that I am almost done with this assignment. it has almost been twenty  minutes. I can't believe it. I thought it would take forever. but I guess it really didn't. hopefully I will talk to mauricio soon. I now I have been focused on him a lot. but it's hard not to be. of course I might not see him for a long time, but. let's not think about that right now. "
Tell me about yourself.,"The reason being is because I am in good health, I do not have problems studying in my classes, and I have now set a routine where I can exercise, study and have fun at the same time. I do have long days on my classes on Mondays and Wednesdays, but when I get through them I recover on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Last year I was not as fortunate with my schedule and my health. I had problems that required I go to a doctor and have x-rays done as well as other tests. Many of the friends of my family also passed away during that year and I was also trying to get myself used to the transition from highschool to college while taking some pretty difficult courses. Overall, I was having a tough time adjusting. I had to miss several classes in order to go in and check what my health problems were. I sometimes even had problems walking at U. T. because of the pains I would feel and did not always fully concentrate on what I needed to. I also seemed to have more distractions my freshmen year and did not always study like I should have. I still made pretty decent grades but I feel I could have done better. Compared to then, life is good. My emotions are better intact, I do not get as nervous as I used to be, and I do not get embarrassed easily to answer questions in class like I used to. I also seem to tolerate more in terms of the differences in people. I still want people to know that I consider God to be important even though they may not. Some people used to tell me that I would change as soon as I entered college and would become like everybody else. I haven't and I want people to understand that even though I may be alone in a lot of issues, I will stand alone and not follow what I don't believe to be true. Sometimes I do not appreciate the fact that some professors don't really care about those in the class who regard God as important and ridicule every person who may believe in that way. I feel sometimes that as a student respects a professor in some of their opinions, then a professor should also respect the student likewise. I do, however, express my feelings to the professor if I feel they are not correctly handling the situation. I do hope the professor does not feel it is an attack on my part and I try to get my points across as diplomatically as I can. With most that I have talked to, I get a pretty good response and we are able to work things out. I do have strong feelings but I hope I do not have to express them in a way that nobody wants to hear. I'm willing to work things out, and I hope that the other individual involved would be the same. "
Tell me about yourself.,"First of all is my class ME 210. I don't want to be taking it at the moment but I will have to take it sooner or later. I am not good at drawing and that is what the class is mainly about. I would love to learn how to do that but I just wish I didn't have to get a grade. I am more worried abut that class than I am about second year cal. I could postpone the class and take it later, maybe during the summer, but I don't know. It will be a hard class for me. The other thing that is on my mind is whether or not I should play baseball. That is a very complicated subject for me. I would be a walk-on. However, several people who know have told me  that I could easily make the team. On the other hand, that would be very time consuming. I have a girlfriend back in Waco who is still in high school and I really want to be able to see her. I am afraid that If I played baseball then I would never be able to go home. Also, I am an aerospace engineer and I will have a lot to do besides. The other side is that I have the ability to play and if I don't then I will look back and wish that I had. I have had to deal with this issue all summer. If I do play baseball then I will likely have to change my schedule. On the other hand I think that one of the reasons that I don't want to play is because I might be afraid of not making the team or of upper classmen or scholarship player harassment if I did make the team. People have always told me not to take my girlfriend into consideration when making my decision but I can't do that. They all think that just because I am going off to college that I will find a new girlfriend, and I may, but I don't want to and It won't be anytime soon. We've already talked about marriage and how when she graduates from high school she could come live with me. She is a junior right now so she has two more years. I would love it if we could be living with each other right now. In the year that we have been going out we have never had an argument. I enjoy her company so much. Well that is what is on my mind at the moment.   "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm feeling pretty good after my jog, but I usually do. I haven't worked out in two weeks; therefore, I was a little surprised that I could still jog the mile. I'm a pretty slow jogger. When I jog, I usually have company--either one friend or another. It's cool when I jog with friends that have about the same speed I do; that way, I don't get burnt out after jogging for only a short distance. In the summer I used to jog with some friends who had much longer legs than I do, and they were more fit. They used to joke that I had to jog two steps for every step that they took. That's good though, I'm getting the better work out. I used to have dreams about jogging and working out before I actually did start exercising regularly. In one of my dreams, I dreamt that I was running forever and it felt really good--I didn't get tired or anything. This past summer, I experienced something kind of like my dream. I jogged straight for  thirty minutes without stopping. When I was down, my muscles felt like jello!  Also this past summer, I didn't do much but go to summer school and work on my craft projects. I used to watch these do-it-yourself shows on PBS when I was little and I guess a part of me has always wanted to try some of the ideas out. In the past couple years, I've begun to do some craft projects on my own. My friend Tina wonders why I would buy so many supplies. I like the variety and after I make something, I usually give it away. so it's not like I'm keeping a dozen replicas of something in my apartment. I do use a lot of the things I made to decorate my apartment. without them, my apartment would look emptier than it already does. I don't have a couch right now, but my parents are coming up this weekend and I think we are supposed to buy a futon. that would be really neat. I've never had a futon before. I went to the Texas union last night and my friends and I saw a bunch of for sale signs for futons and sofas. I might have to go ahead and buy one of those if I don't get a futon this weekend. my friend peter said he'll take me furniture shopping too, at some thrift store. I don't want to buy any new couches right now because it'll be such a big hassle when I have to move out. for this coming summer, a couple of my best friends invited me to room with them if they stay up here for summer school. if I do that, then I can move some of my furniture into the apartment we share. "
Tell me about yourself.,"They are playing the Atlanta Braves. They're good but I think we should be able to defeat them in the playoffs. There closing pitcher, something like, Lightenburg is the ugliest guy in the league: pretty close to Randy Johnson of the Astros. I'm really hungry right now. I want a nice juicy ribeye steak back in Houston. Houston has the best restaurants. The night before I came to school I went to anthony's in houston. I had duck with cherry dressing. It was so good and the dessert was even better. We ordered practically everything on the menu. School is really different from high school. There is so much freedom compared to high school. Not only are parents out of the scene but teachers don't know if you show up to class or not. My bed is so comfortable. I put my two twin beds together and now I have a king sized bed. I love sprawling out on my bed after walking back from class or coming home from a night in Austin. I love UT and I cannot wait until the first football game even though I am leaving town. I am going to Birmingham for my grandmother's 80th birthday. It will be good to see my parents again. My sister is a senior at UT this year and she is going to graduate in the Spring. She is a PR major. This summer she interned for your daughter at Pennebaker Designs. Well I think that is 20 minutes so I am going to stop. I think I am going to go get something to eat. Pizza or maybe some quesadillas. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'll try my best not to organize my thought though and just write what comes to my mind. This stream of consciousness reminds me of my senior author oh what was her name she wrote To the Lighthouse and Mrs. Dalloway. Her name will come to me in just a second. She was a very depressed person I still can't believe she committed suicide by drowning herself she must have really wanted to die. Oh well, I can't remember her name write now. It is strange that I can't remember her name considering I read over a 1000 pages of her writings and wrote three papers on her work. I think I can't remember because I feel too much stress the remember it. In fact, I feel like right when I stop thinking about it her name will pop into my head. I can still vividly see what the covers of all her books look like in my head. Ok I am going to stop thinking about her for right now and think about what I read earlier today from C. S. Lewis' Mere Christianity. It is amazing how much I am learning about the Christian faith and I have been a Christian for a while now. I like what Lewis says about society and morality. How what a person does my himself is important for society because laws do not make moral men. No matter how many laws one can write up the immoral man will always find new ways to get around the laws so what a man does by himself is important to society which had important implications what how society should run and about many privacy issues like abortion. Well I think that privacy is an important thing and it really bothers me how we use of social security number for everything and how the government wants to assign us all a medical id. I will vehemently oppose such a measure. It is hard to write all the thoughts that are in my mind because my mind works a whole lot faster than I can write. So while I'm in the middle of writing this sentence I have already thought of 2 other things. I am kind of disenchanted by politicians and politics. To get to such high positions of power, one has to compromise which means one must be corrupt but I wonder if that is really true I wonder if there can be honest politicians I wonder if there can be honest lawyers. I surely hope so  You know I remember reading one that Diana always had a feeling that she was going to be someone important one day. I wonder if everybody had that same feeling and if it is just a fantasy or a dream that everyone has I still can't believe she is dead you know I feel like I am kind of censoring what I write because of the possibility that so TA might what to read some of these stream of consciousness writings to get a couple of kicks out of it. I think I probably would if I were a TA  it must be really difficult to be a TA and be a grad student. it is hard enough just being an undergrad student. my head kind of hurts right now I wonder if that is from stress  I think it is. My apartment is quiet right now I am very glad I didn't go out with my roommates I like being by myself every once and a while. I love not having to worry about any body but myself but I also love being around people. I really do like having a roommate because you can talk and have fun together I guess everything has its ups and downs Even though today was the first day of class my first day is not really till tomorrow because most of my classes are on Tuesday and Thursday instead of on MWF  I'm really now to nervous right now but I am sure I will get stressed out this semester I really need to learn how to deal with my stress. if not make it go away at least manipulate it to my benefit. Ok I only have to write for a couple more minutes. It is interesting all the strange connections that one thinks about  it seems like I think about the same basic 15 things over and over when ever I have quite time to myself I wonder why that is I am excited about this psychology class. learning about human behavior is always interesting to me  I think some people like psychology so much because they want to learn how to manipulate people and control them -- I guess sort of a power issue  I hope that now why I am interested in psychology. Well, my time is up now It has been kind of staged my writing but only slightly so I still have in the back of my mind this the knowledge that some one might read what I am writing Oh well "
Tell me about yourself.,"what to write?  I am happy right now because I just got a phone call from a  frat that I am going to join. we are having a get together tomorrow and there are going to be strippers!  that should be cool. but I don't know what to wear. I always get nervous about what I should wear. I hope my girlfriend does not find out, even though I will probably tell her, and she'll probably get mad like she sometimes does. I wonder when clay is coming home?  we have to work out tonight, and I still have a lot of Persian how to do. my throat feels better today than it has all weekend. I was really sick for the last three days so I stayed home and watched the 30th anniv. of Planet of the Apes. that was a good movie. I have never seen any before and now I want to go buy the  whole set because it was so good. but I need to get my job first and save up my money for headshots, an agent, then I can buy crap like new clothes and videos and cds. I can't wait until tomorrow, it is going to be so much fun!  I hope that I feel okay. I feel better today but tomorrow I need to be totally healthy. I hope I did one of those things where I got sick at a good time so I didn't miss anything important. This writing takes forever, I have other stuff I need to do to. Oh, well, it's for science. I m bored. my eyes are drying out from looking at the computer screen. when is clay going to get back?  I also have some theater homework I need to do. I am so tired, maybe I should just forget the how and go to bed early so I feel good tomorrow. yeah then I could fail all my classes and get kicked out of UT. that would suck. I did nothing today. it was a relaxing though somewhat boring day. but I needed it because I have been sick all weekend. I have been able to start smoking again, but I really should quit sometime soon. I am tired, it's hard to focus. I guess my body has been working over time to kill this damn disease I got. I need to call laila, I miss her. maybe we could all play solarquest. my neck is stiff but I still have 10 minute to write. this takes forever. I wonder when it is due?  I heard the 11th but I am not so sure. I wonder what the other assignment is about. I hope it is not like this. ,  I have a lot to do tonight but I must be in bed by 12. I need all the sleep I can get. I am tired. this is really starting to bore me. what is the point? write down every thought you think. seems creepy. I hope who ever reads this one is laughing and enjoying themselves. some how I doubt it. this is not very funny--it would be though, if I could say it. I hope no one minds all the hundreds of mistakes I made, and if they do, who cares?  what are they going to do?  put in computer jail?  Someone I knew said that all the time. but I can not remember who. I miss Joann. I wonder how she is doing at Sam Houston state. I also miss jena, I really hope I see her before she goes and flies off to Germany. I hope her life is not hard, and I wish here and michael all the best. my ear hurts. four minutes left. I was beginning to feel trapped in time. stuck forever by this computer typing away through all eternity. I am really tired, but I am glad I got this one out of the way. just a couple of minutes left. that woman at the dinner was so weird. and what about her HUGE 2 year old?  that was scary, but so is ""Walt"" so I guess it is okay. Well time has run out and now it is time to go. that took forever. "
Tell me about yourself.,"For instance, adjusting to the enormous crowd of students and coping with the overcrowded lecture halls has been extremely difficult. In addition, meeting new friends has also presented another challenge for me because I live off campus. I attempt to meet new people in my classes; however, it seems I haven't established any new friendships yet. However,  I will continue my efforts throughout the semester. Furthermore, I have been overwhelmed by the hours of homework I have been assigned each evening. It is a drastic change from my responsibilities in high school. I have made a strong commitment to myself to succeed- no matter the obstacles I encounter. I have dreamed of earning my degree at the University of Texas since I was a small child. As I grew into a young adult, I never let go of my aspiration to attend the University. My unceasing desire motivates me to apply my abilities and employ my talents to surpass all odds. I will accomplish my goals and I will prove to myself and family I can do anything that I put my mind to. When I get discouraged, I refer to the scripture, ""I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. ""  I know I can succeed at the University of Texas with my sincere desire and strong determination. "
Tell me about yourself.,"to tell you the truth I really have now idea what to say. So. I guess the easiest thing to do to make the 20 mins. pass as quickly possible is to tell you all about myself. Where to start??? Well. I was born in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia in the Clinic B Hospital. To my fellow Aramcon's I am also known as a ""clinic B Baby. ""  I am, however, not the slightest bit Saudi even though the experience has had a wonderful and great impact on my life. What brought my parents, Dan and Karen, to Arabia in the 1st place was the huge amount of oil. My father is a geologist and a graduate of UT. My parent's have been visiting me here in Texas and are leaving tomorrow back to Saudi:-(  I'm used to the good-byes though so although I am quite sad it is something that I have learned to get used to. I attended a little all girls boarding school in McLean, Va for the past 3 years so I guess my transition went quite a but smoother than that of my fellow Freshmen. Well. I am getting bored of talking about myself so I guess I'll move on to something else.       I just returned from UT's caving society meeting. It was BY FAR the most interesting experience of my day. Well. to begin. there were no other UT students from the looks of things excluding the friends that I went with. Instead I ran into a TON of my parents old family friends. My parents met while caving with the UT club in Mexico AGES ago and my uncle TR was the famous old president of the Club ages ago and discovered some huge cave in Mexico. I had know idea what I was getting myself into when I happened to see a little flyer about the meeting and am so excited about caving in the near-by future. This weekend I'm going camping with my sister, Katie, and we're supposed to do some caving while we are there so I'm psyched! Only 2 more day to go!  Bye! "
Tell me about yourself.,"Although, I constantly advocate to my friends that one should make the best of everything, I failed to do so. Recently, I have noticed a drastic change in my life. Prior to the major transition of my life (college), I used to constantly worry. worry. worry. Although I still worry, I have learned to view life from another perspective. Each and every minute I must be productive, but no longer is my school work the only ""productive"" thing in my life. I realized that simply chatting with some friends or relaxing can result into a more elaborate learning experience then simply books. For instance, I was watching a movie last night (something I rarely do because I feel I am not being productive) that enhanced my knowledge of the world around me. Very few movies make me think long after I finished watching the movie, but this one did. The overall design and structure of the movie was not to great, but the plot behind the movie sparked some circuits and made me question particular aspects of life. All in all, I am trying to stress that I am still learning regardless of what I do. This certain attitude towards life has allowed me to be open-minded and not as stressed out as usual. Today, I have several things to do. My priority list is very long, but I am limited with time. It seems the more I think about how much I have to do, the less time I have to do it. I have two tests next week. Chemistry and Calculus, respectively. My weekend is going to be centered around studying for those two tests. Hopefully, my mind will allow me to concentrate on those two tests and only those two tests. Austin, or rather UT, is a very convenient campus. Opposed to my hometown, UT allows me to travel many places on foot or even by bus. This form of transportation is very tempting!  I just bought a laptop which I am very excited about. I felt rushed when I bought it, but it is too late now. I still have to buy a PC card for it so I can access the internet from my dorm. I want to designate a weekend to upgrading and buying software for my computer, but I have so many things on my mind. By the time I get around to doing so, a whole new line of computers will be on the market!!!  My life is busy, hectic, stressful, etc. But, I enjoy it!  I am confused on what organizations I should join here at UT. I am used to being a part of and active in nearly everything I am offered. Here at UT, I am unaware of everything they have to offer and therefore, not a participant in everything I want to join. I hope that I will gradually reach the peak I was at in high school. I am sure I will. I was  unaware of my surroundings a minute ago and this man was asking me a question. whoops. I believe I have reached my goal now, after reading the assignment nearly 20 times.     "
Tell me about yourself.,"I just sent him an email message. actually, we are having , well not really problems, it is just hard because of the distance. It makes me feel like maybe I made the wrong decision by coming all the way here. I didn't really have a good reason, other than I knew I wanted to go out of state and this is a really good business school. Everyone asks why I came here. I'm sick of explaining it. I wish there were more out of state students here. I was really homesick the other day I just couldn't wait until thanksgiving. I couldn't sleep at all. Hmmm. that's just what we talked about in class today. Whether people would sleep longer if they were sad, or f they would have trouble sleeping. I just felt terrible. It was the first time I'd ever been that homesick. However, I've never really been this far away from home before, and for this amount of time.   I wonder if all these papers are going to be approximately the same length, or if people who type slower will have really short papers. It's only been like 5 minutes so far. I wish I typed slower. We had to do some kind of journal similar to this in My freshman English Class. We would give them names and everyday, we had to write for ten minutes about whatever first came into our heads. Back then I thought what a waste of time, but now I wish all our assignments were like this. It's great mot having to think of making sure all the sentences are in the right tense or I am using works correctly. I'm not in my room right now. I'm borrowing the computer ozone of my neighbors. and his suitemate just walked in with dinner. It smells really good. Now I'm hungry. I tried reading the first chapter in my psychology book over the weekend. I don't know, I just get so discouraged because I have a really short attention span especially when not reading ""Reader friendly material""  I just can't concentrate on it. I've tried lots of methods, like taking notes and speaking it aloud while I'm reading it and all sorts of stuff. It just doesn't seem to work. Don't get me wrong, I think this will be my favorite class this year, It is just hard to digest. I'm glad I didn't take Psychology in High School. Supposedly, the teacher was really hard and the class was pretty useless. Instead, I took all hard classes. That's why I'm here. Because I was one of the 69 out of state students who were accepted into the school of business administration. I feel bad telling people that though. It makes me feel stuck-up. I don't want to be stuck up. I know too many people who are and I see others talking behind their backs. I really don't want that to ever happen. Actually, I'm pretty happy with myself the way it is (or was in Illinois)  I had a lot of really close friendships that I left behind. Some are still kind-of open ended, I didn't get to say goodbye, and other things like that. I made my plane tickets today. I get to leave on Tuesday to go home for thanksgiving, and on the 12th for christmas. I can't wait. I want to see how everyone has changed, and I guess, hope that they didn't change too much. Some I was worried about because they like to take things as they come into play and don't really think about how it might affect them in the future. I just want them to be safe. Tim just asked if I wanted any of his soup. I guess that is what he got for dinner. He's nice. actually all the guys next door are nice. My roommate however will take some getting  used to. She is Muslim and I'm Christian. We kind of clash with religious opinions. Well, I guess I'm done now! "
Tell me about yourself.,"Not only was the server down but it has taken several minutes to upload, even when I am connected at 32000 bps. I'm also seemingly tired because I just got back from water polo practice and we did a lot of swimming today. I feel a sense of responsibility doing this assignment and the others so I can get  back to reading the text and doing other subjects. At this point I'm winding down the day to get ready for bed and this is the time to release all the stress and aches  and to clear my thoughts. The only thoughts the come to my mind are what I will put in this assignment after each word. I do feel a little amused because I am also having a conversation over the internet with a friend in Houston, so I am not totally out of it yet. I also have to arrange my classes for the next day so I can be prepared with my bag and books I guess. I also need to set my clock and get ready to wash up and finish this letter. But I guess this is all the time I have and I will be ending this right now   :-) "
Tell me about yourself.,that sucks  what the hell am I supposed to do until then  I have to go to a friends place to type all my papers and send all my email from there  I feel like everything goes wrong at once I mean come on what kind of cheap ass computer breaks after having it for only 4 days  everything else is going fine except for all the meetings and crap I have to go to everyone up here expects so much from me I just sent a thousand people e mails and all the people who I wanted to hear from did not answer and all the people who I did want to hear from never responded  I guess I can't hold on to this false hope that all my friends from high school will also be my friends now unfortunately I haven't made any new friends up here either everyone else seems to be doing okay at making new friend and I don't think that I m antisocial or anything I'm just not as outgoing around people I don't know that well I'm trying to do this stupid thing while watching TV and its not working too well but its the MTV music awards and therefore its worth watching I like music and the radio stations up here are pretty good and they don't play that many commercials so there is a lot of music on all the time so last weekend my friends wrecked the car and I can't take my computer to get fixed  these girls that I used to make fun of in Houston are still mad at me up here I mean how long can someone hold a grudge I emailed both of them today and if they email me back then I will know that they aren't still angry with me well my twenty minutes are up now and I can get onto my homework and watch some of the music awards I think that me and my friends might go clubbing tonight and maybe I can meet some good looking honeys 
Tell me about yourself.,"Since I am already on the computer I am going to do 1 writing assignment. That's good because I wont have to worry about it later. I can take care of other things on my list, and I 'll be that much closer to going home. I like my new place. Its big and cold and my best buds live there. Theyre all cool except for the new guy, jon. This fella really has a stick up his ass. I respect that he works full time and is usually tired, but come on. Working doesn't give you any special rights except to get a paychek. It sure doesn't mean that all of your roommates should feel sorry for you and get you things. I can tell this is going to be a problem. We've already had words several times. What blew my mind was that this guy was willing to let it escalate into a fistfight in less than a minute. I mean, he's got to live with me for a whole year!  Am I the only one thinking here?  I really had to get raw then, telling him that that is NOT how we handle things in a civilized society, especially mine. He wants to shack up with me, Cap, and Bob, then he has to realize that we're tight and that if anybody gets roughed up, its him. Also, Bob's girlfriend has become a permanent fixture, already. I don't understand why she can't live where she pays rent, and carry on a relationship simultaneously. Everyone else does. I love bob to death, but this woman is no good for him. They're engaged, and she still gives everybody the ""look"" when he leaves the room. I feel sorry for him. But I should probably be glad it's not still me. I think the only reason that I bitch about some things is that it frustrates to see my bros not have it together like I do. Like half of my boys from dobie last year aren't even coming back. and the clincher, the real salt in the wound, is that none of them couldn't mentally make it here, its that they were so fucking lazy and unmotivated that they pissed it all away. Those were some of my best friends ever. I'll keep in touch with them, but when I talk to them I always feel a twinge of anger at them for not filling thier end of the bargain. They say they'll be back next semester, but I don't believe. A lot of them are so lazy that not even seeing what they'll miss is enough to get their attention. That's why I stay focused and that's why I'll stay at ut. "
Tell me about yourself.,I took a class in sewimming last year and it was a lot of fun. my cousin megan asked me to come to her dance recital in october but that is going to kind of difficult since I have three tests on the following week of school when I get back but life is short I may as well seize the day. I didn't call my girlfriend last night so she is probably mad about that but anyway. I like the class schedule that I am taking right now but it is only thirteen hours so I hope I finish my degree plan in four years since I don't want to be in school forever. I have a headache and don't feel like doing anything but relaxing. I wish I was traveling righnt now maybe around the swiss alps and doing some hiking camping and fishing and even some swimming just exploring beautiful places that I have never been to before. I woild love to just have a job where I could explore travel destinations and tell people if it was a good place or not or even just travel the world. I love adventures especially the ones like indiana jones does in his series of movies I think that that is so interesting and fun but I kjnow it is only a dream since all of that is just make believe but hopeuflly on e day I will get married and we can travel the world exploring different copuntries and places and seeing everything this world has to offer. this summer I got to visit seattle and it was very beautiful except that it rained every single day adn that got kind of depressing and made you feel gloomy but it was an experience and a very expensive one at athat. this christmas me and my cousince and bro are goign to go on a road trip kind of like the one on mtv called road rules where we go exploring places and then camping out and living off the land which is really a lot of fun. I hope my mom is having a good day and my dad and sister. my brother is up here in austin with me so we hang out my birthday is tomorrow and I will be the big 21 I can't wait. my firneds are throwing me a party this weekend so it is going to be a lot of fun. I have math homewrok thath I need to do  
Tell me about yourself.,"Which is funny, because I have no idea what the hell it is I want to say. I guess all I can say for now is that colege is sorta a rude awakening. No one give a shit about your ass anymore. it's all on your own. I love this place though. No kidding. What makes it all funny is, the people are nice, yet in a way, weird. Weird in a sense that they are so superficial and incredibly narrow minded about EVERYTHING. It's like the asians stick amongst themselves, the white boys stick amongst their littl eall american jock group,(of which I detest), and the chicks are well, they're just there. Forget I ever said anything about females here. Some are really on the bizarre side. Some are really great and interesting. Then their's the ones you wonder a whole lot about. This reminds me of high school already. I wonder what writing about anything for a good twenty minutes will do for my psychological condition. Does it make me say,. . alert to my surroundings? Or is all this just a buch of really great BS? Something tells me there is a higher lesson to be learned here,. even if it IS BS. So, It's about 1:07 in the damn morning, and I'm thinking Jeez, I need to finish this quickly so I can finich my economics. Speaking of which, I cannot believe how incredibly and uterrly boring my economics professor is. Six times is how much I fell asleep. she is certainly entertaining with her material, boy. This assignment sorta reminds me of my favorite book, the Catcher in the Rye. I feel like Holden Caulfield, for some freaking reaosn. I guess I just feel apathetic towards everything at the moment. I don't know why. . great, I just figured out how the hell the refrigerator and the microwave can coexist together. This is a bit strange. I sudden;y feel as if I'm just rambling to myself. As if I had nothing better to do than to talk to myself. Then again. It's 1 o'clock. What else can I do at 1 in the morning? Evidently nada. One thing bothers me though. All my friends are constantly talking about what fine chick he sae today and how much he wanted her. That;s perfectly normal and all, but I just don't get it. For one thing, I really hate just ""asking out a girl"". That is so stereotypical and well, it sucks. Men are so pathetic sometimes when it comes to the opposite sex. I'm only too glad that we run this whole damn world,a not the ladies. Thy would screw up everything, damn near! Great, now I'm being cynical. And I'm still talking to myself. This can't be good. I think I should talk to a therapist about this someday. Better yet, I'm jsut going to talk to the professor. This is nuts. I need a vacation. Preferably somewhere in the Carribean. My brains are etting fried up from too much studyin and what not. So,. . I have two minutes left. Great. Good. I was getting a bit hot. That;s better. I love air conditioning. Anyway,. . whoa, . yet another surprising twist. Where did I hear someone say  ""she's skinny cause she's thinner, for she eats her breakfast, lunch and dinner, she takes care of her body, for she's a really great winner. Good nutrition rules?"" That does it. I'm calling my psychotherapist. I wonder why there isn't a thing called linner of dunch. I mean, there's brunch and all. . "
Tell me about yourself.,"So, far college life has been pretty cool. I really enjoy the freedom. I think I have a big problem with authority though. I'm terrified of the first test in each class. Especially psychology. Those people are experts on how to mess with students' minds and how to ask questions in order to trick you. I really don't think that there is all that much adjustment to college life. Basically I do the same things I did at home, except now I have to do my own laundry. But the bad thing is that I don't get to cook. I love to cook. I'm also really good at it. Inventing my own recipe gives me such a thrill. My parents say that's why I'm good/like chemistry. That's another thing. I'm really worried that being an engineer will be really hard. This semester my classes are not all that bad, but I still have a long way to go. Everyone says that engineering is the hardest field to go into, especially chemical engineering. I don't really have that much confidence in myself, and basically I just want to pass with Cs. Although I'd do anything to graduate in the Cum Laude. School is really the only thing that I've been better than average in. I don't even think I really excel in that!  There just always seems to be many others that are better than me. For once in my life I want to win something or be the best at something. But, I'm rushing for the Theta Tau fraternity. It is a professional engineering co-ed fraternity. I met some of the members today. They seem to be REALLY AWESOME!  I'm nervous that they won't like me though. They seemed to be interested in me today though. More so than the other people who were there. My boyfriend, whom I love dearly, is pledging the Phi Psi fraternity. I don't approve at all. He spends most of his time with these guys. NOT ONCE has he invited me to go to their parties/outings. HE always comes back telling me how they can't wait to meet me, and how other guys' girlfriends can't wait to meet me. I can't believe that other guys bring their girlfriends, but he doesn't bring me. I know he loves me, but I still feel left out. Most of the time, the activities really are only for the guys though. But on Thursday night they're having the pledge line thing. It's a semi-formal party. He HAS to bring a date, and coincidentally this will be the first time that I meet these guys. I really don't like fraternities or sororities. I hate everything they stand for. But I like Theta Tau because they are not superficial or big partiers and they rally care about engineering and finding a job in that field. These other Greek groups are more concerned with drinking and members of the opposite sex and smoking and conforming to a specific type of person. I DETEST smoking. Ever since my boyfriend began hanging out with these guys he's become a ""social smoker. ""  I have told him how I feel and asked that he at least not smoke when I'm around because I refuse to kiss anyone that tastes like smoke. Besides, I don't want him to turn into a smoker and have health problems. I care way too much about him. We've discussed the possibility of marriage-much later in life of course. He's really important to me and I'd do anything for him. That's why I hate the fraternity so much. I see the bad influences they have on him. He wants to go to medical school, and he MUST have the grades and the dedication in order to fulfill this goal. He certainly has the potential and I really don't want him to fail. But, I really need to learn to let others lead their lives. I know I can't boss everyone around. I know I'm very controlling and that I've really made some bad feelings between us, but I can't help it. I get a huge blinding and violent surge in me when I think about all that stuff. I hate it when people don't listen to me (usually I end up being right too). Well, that's 20 minutes.  "
Tell me about yourself.,"Although overall, I am having the time of my life, finally being away from home and family and finally free from parental restrictions, it's not all fun. I'm actually on my own. I can't believe it - for the first time, I won't have my parents to rely on everything for. I'll have to take on so much more responsibility for myself. And I think I'm prepared for it too, which is a very good feeling. Even though I've made soo many new friends (and some enemies), it's not the same anymore. I don't know if that's good or bad, but it's just different. I still would've preferred going to the college I wanted to go to, Columbia U. I guess I'm still angry at my parents for not letting me go out of state. oh well, I'll just have to accept it. Right now it's late, almost midnight. I am tired and I have so much to say right now but I just can't get it all out. most of what I think about nowadays is what my future will be like and what I actually want to pursue in my education. Do I really have the commitment to study medicine? What am I going to major in? I'm just full of doubts about myself sometimes. A lot of my motivation comes from my desire to just be successful and happy in life. Right now my parents are preparing for their trip to India. They haven't been there in 2 years. I feel so distant and alienated from my relatives over there. Somehow I feel my parents' families resent me because I was actually born in America. Also, I don't really feel ""indian. "" I am American in the full sense of the word. That's been a huge conflict I've had with myself -- my ethnic identity. The indian community I have lived with tends to separate itself from other cultures, an idea which I dislike. So I find my self associating more with people of other races, which is terrific for me. However, I find myself separated often from people of my own heritage because I act different. I don't always hang out with Indian people. In fact, I rarely do. Strangely, it's a good feeling, knowing that my identity was developed by ME, not by the culture of some country my parents happened to live in less than half their lives. I don't know why I can be so bitter about this subject. I guess I just resent the idea of the Indian culture trying to shape my life. I am about ME, not about being Indian. Ok now that I'm getting into this stream of consciousness thing, I'm going to complain about something else. How about religion? I am very proud of the fact that I am a christian. However, my parents don't seem to believe I am religious because I do not shout and jump and down and speak in tongues and faint at church services. I am more of a reserved person, and my parents don't seem to recognize that. It's the same way with the Indian church I used to go to. I left that church because basically everyone there was a hypocrite. Church, to them and especially for my dad, was something to make themselves look good. As long as they pretend they were holy and righteous, they were in good standing with the indian community. I couldn't stand it so I left for a better church. Spiritually I am thriving and growing with christ, and it's been such a blessing for me. Right now, my roommate is out partying and I'm stuck in my room sick and my legs hurt. funny, I don't really feel lonely. I actually like being by myself. With others sometimes I feel like I have to act like I'm someone else. Alone, I can actually be myself. my hands hurt and they are tired now, but I feel like typing more. I wonder if people think I'm some kind of nerd or recluse. I hate when people assume that about me since I'm not a party person and I do well in school. I really am different from most people, and I like that about me. When I get married and have kids (IF I even want to have kids), that's something important I want to teach them -- to develop themselves as individuals, not part of a group. That's what the problem is today with gangs or other kinds of cliques. people feel such a great need to belong to something or a group. not me. and I don't care what other people think. maybe I'm too proud of myself. who knows. if someone were to read this, they'd think I have no friends or something. nothing can be farther from the truth. I really do have a lot of friends. basically I look for some shred of intellect and personality in a person I want to befriend. So as I'm winding down writing all the thoughts that my brain is oozing out, I have to express a couple feelings. I'm excited about my new beginning in life at UT. I'm still pretty apprehensive about my future and what my goals actually are. I know I am competent and capable of doing anything. before this starts to sound really gay, I think I must end this. ok no I wont, haha! I still have a little more to say. I am a night person. I don't know why. but I just love being awake at night, not in the daytime. it's so peaceful and quiet. it's a strange feeling knowing you're awake and alive and you are so energized while everyone else is sleeping. I feel like I can do things I couldn't do in the daytime because everyone would see me. I wonder what people think when they see me. are they repulsed by me or what? I know I'm not the most attractive person in the world, and that's a fact. I wonder how much less people think of me because I am fat. I am really trying to lose the excess pounds though. don't get me wrong -- I'm not dieting because of what other people think. I KNOW it's not healthy for me, and believe me, I intend to live a long healthy life, and I need to start. sometimes I feel I am less of a person because of my physical imperfections. I don't intend to be a statistic of the ""freshman 15. "" well, with all that said, I am ending this now. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I live in Amarillo and I can't exactly drive home to see them. I envy the people in my dorm who only live a few hours away from home. They can visit their friends and family on every weekend or weekday for that matter. I feel a little guilty because I miss my friends more than I miss my family. Maybe that is because I had a better relationship with my friends than I did with my family. this is probably because I spent a lot more time with my friends during the past few years. It seemed I felt empty if I didn't see my friends for a day, but I could go weeks without seeing my family and I'd feel just fine. Don't get me wrong, I love my family, and I do feel slightly homesick, but I have a stronger relationship withe my friends. Whenever I spent ""quality time"" with my folks, all we would do would sit on the couch in the living room and watch Seinfeld; we would never talk, but it really wasn't their fault. Whenever I would feel like talking about something important that was on my mind, they wouldn't have a problem with it, but I would feel awkward. It has always been that way, so it's not some kind of ""teenager"" thing that just kind of happened during my rebellious years. My parents are the greatest, and so are my three brothers. I have one older brother that is about to turn 20, so the age difference is pretty narrow. We used to do things all the time when we were younger, but now we hardly talk at all. I also have two younger brothers, 8 and 14 who are also great, but they're not so easy to talk to. My brother, Kyle, who is 14, has a lot of problems I think. He doesn't have any friends and he always just stays home and watches tv and plays video games. When I ask him how his day was, he just says fine, and thats all the conversation really consists of. I couldn't really talk to him because I felt so sorry for him. I also worry about my mom because she loses sleep trying to find ways to help him. My youngest brother, on the other hand, has plenty of energy and self-confidence and a lot of friends. I think he'll be one of the ""popular guys"" in school, and I feel bad when my little 8 year old brother can outdo my 14 year old brother Kyle. I also try to think up ways to raise Kyle's self confidence, but I'm really not much of a help. I find myself making fun of him unconciosly just like many big brothers all do, but I really feel bad about it. I sometimes know how he feels because in junior high I didn't always have five or ten friends to hang out and talk with, and I sometimes found myself at home on the weekends feeling like a loser, but I eventually found my place and my friends in high school, and I hope that's what he does when he goes to high school next year. He is old for his grade because he was held back in the first grade, and he has some kind of a learning problem and when I try to help hime with his school work he gets embarrassed and won't let me. I just really hopes he finds his place in high school or if not, in college, like many people do. so, maybe I should spend more time with my family when I get home in a few monthes instead of with my friends "
Tell me about yourself.,"So much needs to be done within the next two days, it seems practically impossible to get it done. I have to write these two essays, redo the entire freaking' pretesting crap just because I completed 79% of it and then when it kicked me off, it didn't even save it although I was informed otherwise. So, frankly, I'm disturbed by a lot of things. I have a journalism test tomorrow morning, which, by the way, I haven't studied for, and tonight I had a presentation for APO, a service organization I would like to join if, in the midst of all this chaos called ""college"", I can somehow find the time for a decent social life. So this ""stream of conscience"" theory is going to be more of a ""Kelli needs to vent"" period, because frankly, that is all that is on my mind. I had a crappy day, and I don't expect writing this will help me all that much, but I'll go ahead and say what happened. Some egotistical freak from the male species grabbed my ass today while I was one of the many cross walks on this large campus. Granted I hyper-extended is wrest, at worst I broke it, I would like to request respect from the gender that so frequently asks the inevitable question ""why""  when the finger always points to them!!  It was freaking' hot outside all day, and running from class to class always makes it oh so much cooler!!  And the whole idea of college is running through me now when I have deadlines for tests, papers, and self-indulgent pompous professors who think they know the answer to the world, and what's even scarier than that is that WE pay to wake up at 8 AM to go to their lectures and believe the handfuls of bullshit they try to feed us. (I was making a generalization about the professor part of course, some lectures are actually stimulating. )  To top it off, somewhere in the midst of all of this mumbling jumble of chaotic words, I feel almost depressed tonight. I met a guy at the APO organization meeting mentioned before, and I REALLY like him, and I heard that he was interested, but I haven't seen him in six days, and I honestly think that he could actually calm me from this feeling of intense pressure. If I could just see him I would relax and then take a different view on all the crap that I still have to do. I guess I just need him right now, and the longer I go before I see him again, the more distant and hopeless I feel toward him. I guess you can say I've been lulled into inertia by my subconscience feelings to see him. Anyway, my twenty minutes of rambling has come to an end, so it was great venting and I hope, in some weird way, this has satisfied your requirements and calmed your thoughts and revelations about the stream of conscience in a frustrated, tired, and ticked off college student. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am totally hopeful that in the next two hours I will be able to find a date. also I am feeling a little stressed because I don't know what is going to happen to me if I don't do good and transfer into the business school because if I get denied I am probably going to have to transfer back to an easier business school in the Midwest which is the last thing I want to do. I really love it here in Austin, the people are so much nicer than people back in Chicago where I am from. Southern hospitality is really not a myth, the people are truly charming and I love the Southern accent. Back in Chicago the people are not nice and overall the attitude there is obnoxious. That is one of the major reasons that I decided to come here, I knew it would be nicer and it is. But the only thing that I don't like is why I get the vibe from some people that I shouldn't be here, they always ask me ""Why did you come here"" and they don't ask it nicely. I wonder if it is a possessive feeling that people here in Texas have about their state. It is definitely still going to take a bit of getting used to before I am able to feel like I fit in because right now I feel like a foreigner in a faraway place. I am definitely not used to feel like a minority, it is something I am also going to get a lot of crap for especially with my fraternity, because out of 60 pledges only me and a guy from Minnesota are the only out of states. Pledgeship doesn't worry me but I am anxious to meet people and it isn't happening here I n the Towers where I live because it is so much like an apartment complex and not a dorm that no one goes out of the way to meet people which I truly did not expect. I wish that this stupid girl next to me whose computer I am using who ditched me on the way to your class is are really not nice girl who is way too cool for me , she s got a slight attitude problem and I think that it relates to boyfriend problems. See you later. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I feel overwhelmed at the size and population of the school and classes, but at the same time am overjoyed to be here. I spent a year at Stephen F. Austin for my freshman year of college and liked it alright, but the school was not right for me, I think it had more to do with the town than the school, but anyhow I like being in Austin and love being around old friends, but at this moment I feel as if I haven't gotten into the school year just yet. I haven't studied enough and that makes me feel inadequate inefficient, worthless. But I don't dwell on that thought and one of the things which bring me happiness is having my own home this year. Two friends of mine from high school have been rooming together for the last few weeks and there is a lot of freedom involved in having your own place and that brings a lot of comfort to me. Right now I feel relaxed, relieved to be through with classes today. tomorrow is another day and I feel like I have a lot of time to get all my assignments finished. Another comfort for today is getting to finish this assignment. This is the first day I have been able to get into the UGL computer library and luckily I made it in before the deadline. I tried trice before but was rejected each time by some substantial reason which inhibited my using these wonderful machines. These are SO much better than the computers from SFA that I think I shall nut my pants. one other comfort is being able to write freely without impending restrictions from keeping you to a fake writing of what your thoughts are but not really because one is not able to freely express himself through outlawed writing styles, such as uncapitalized letters, lack of punctuation, all borders are allowed to be crossed and I love this freedom. I am feeling very good about myself right now I have just completed my first assignment of the year, well almost completed. I hope I have done this right and this has actually been fun. I look forward to writing on this assignment again. I have 4 more minutes to write I think just to be safe ill keep going a little longer . I am thinking about how this will be graded . I wonder if there could be some way of directly reading what I am writing in real time. and maybe he has hired hundreds of his minions to read just as we write so that they may choose while reading who is doing the right thing and who is not . I think I may stay here all day I like doing work and doing work well I am going to do all of my projects ahead of time so that I may be ahead of all my classes and pass in flying colors. I love school what else do I need to accomplish? I have to sign up for some experiments as well I'd best do that also. I am feeling so stress free right now , very relaxed. I think I have wrote enough but am not sure. so anyway I am the greatest artist on this world and will revolutionize this world in some way in my lifetime. this is my goal to change the world to revolutionize it to be known to be the best at everything to learn to be knowledgeable to be experienced? experienced, and to learn how the brain works is good to, and to learn how the world works , that's good to  I love life who ever does not appreciate life and appreciate the sun rising every morning is insane, I am wishing I had a disk right now to save this stream of coincioussness writing style I like it I am going to do it again, . goodbye I am submitting my work now in a minute three more minutes. I wonder what I will wish I had accomplished when I look back ten years from now. like I look back and wonder when did I think I would be right now ten years ago? hmmm that's ponderous man really ponderous. I am glad to be here rather than home because at home I can not get much done yet it is still such a new experience that I have other priorities ahead of school work there but just there not here and only sometimes. like if kori came over I would never do homework again. yeah. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I ran out of the regular clothes I wear to school and all that was left in my closet were dresses. I'm also a bit upset because the guy I am interested in keeps giving me mixed signals and his emotions just run hot and cold. I feel that he may just be leading me on and it really hurts me because I really like him and I have felt this way for a while now. My friends tell me to just forget about him but easier said than done. And I'm afraid to say anything to him because I may just be making a fool of myself. But, I really hate to think about this because it just depresses me (a subject we just finished talking about today in class). I hope to learn more about it and maybe learn something about how to analyze his behavior with me. Aside from that and probably the biggest thing on my mind right now is all the reading I have to do for my classes. I know tonight I will be up pretty late even though I have to be at school at 8am! I have forgotten how stressful school is. I guess lazing around all summer couldn't last forever. Oh well, it doesn't matter I actually like school and some of the pressures. It makes life interesting. Now, I'm wondering if my roommate will be home when I get there. She is a great person and I really like sharing an apartment with her this year. The only problem is that we goof around a lot together and don't get much done we decide to do homework in the same room. Good thing we have a 2 bedroom apt. Speaking of our apartment. I'm really hungry! My stomach was growling so much in class the guy next to me was looking at me funny. I just wish there were more hours in the day so I could get more things done. But, I guess everyone feels that way. As I write this I'm just glad I am at least getting one assignment out of the way. And I wish all of my assignment for all my classes were this easy. haha Well, I guess I am running out of things to say so it's a good things my twenty minutes are almost up. I'm just mad that I can't check my email because there is something wrong with my disk. I swear computers hate me. Now I won't know if my friend Raul wrote me back. I will buy an other disk tomorrow. great another expense. I need a job. "
Tell me about yourself.,"it cuts into my social time and I hate that I can't do some things because I have to get ready for my classes the next day. I enjoy college that much. well I enjoy the social aspects and the fact that I can meet all kinds of new and interesting people, but I am so sick of school and the first week isn't even over yet. that is very sad. I wonder if everyone is this way. well at least I am trying to get a head start on all the psychology requirements. if I get them out of the way immediately then I don't have to worry about them at the end of the semester when I need to be worrying about my other finals. I am very grateful that we don't have a final in this psychology course. psychology is very interesting to me. I don't think I could pursue a career in it though. I just think it is neat to study what people are thinking and why they are thinking things. I think I can handle the class. think I can handle everything this semester. I just hope that I don't get too homesick and that I get along well with everyone. I can't wait to see Chris my childhood friend. he is so smart. he is fixing to start working on his phd in pharmacology. he hasn't always been this smart. when he got into high school his brain started to kick in gear I guess. ever since then he has made straight A's and has been the class genius. I guess what he needed was a boost of self confidence. his brother on the other hand needs confidence and motivation more than anyone I know. he irritates me sometimes because everyone has to go to him and he won't go do anything without people forcing him to go. I love him though. it is funny how someone can irritate you to death but because you've known him forever you have to accept his faults and still  love him. it is funny how people are so impressed with money and the people that have a lot of it. if you had a bunch of money you could have instant friends. it drives me crazy that people don't look at the person but what the person  has. you end up worse for it because that person that has all the money  just ends up annoying everyone else. anyway there are some people out there that aren't like that and don't go crazy over someone because they have a lot of money. that is one thing I have learned that you can't stereotype people at all because there are always exceptions to the rules. well my twenty minutes up and it went by real fast. it is funny how fast time goes by when your mind is preoccupied or you are having fun. I think it is neat. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I work at a daycare in the mornings on Teusday and Thursday before class and friday after class. During the day I am in my classes and at night I have meetings or readings to do. I am sytressing out right now, and I am trying to not think about how much I need to do. Each time I finish with one task I feel a little better but after a few minutes I get stressed out again. I can not wait for the labor day weekend though, because I am going to spend some of time catching up with all of my readings and some of my time just relaxing. I think after Labor day I will be relaxed and I will not be so stressed out with all of my work. I like my job in the mornings on Teusday and Thursday, I work at a daycare for infants. I work with the two months to two years, from eight in the morning until twelve-thirty in the afternoon. I like working with that age of children, because they are so trusting. They are away from their parents, but they still are so relaxed and trusting with all of the teachers at the daycare. I feel dumb writting this, because I have so much going through my mind but I can't write it all down, because most of it is the same thing over and over. Wondering how I am going to finish all of my homework and go to work and go to my meetings. I geuss for the most part I am just stressing out because it is the begining of the semester, and my goal for this  semester is to make at least a 3. 75. I feel that if I get behind at the begining of the semester, I will never be able to catch up, and I will not reach my GPA goal. I am a very opptimistic person though, so I know that if I keep up with my work I will be able to reach my goal, and maybe even get higher. Another thing though is that I should be a junior in years, but I am nine hours short, so over next semester and the summer I have to catch up, so that I can graduate on time. I am not worried about that, I am more concerned with my grades, because I know that I can catch up in summer, and next semester. I feel a little bit better no that I have almost completed this assignment, so that is a little off my head that I do not have to worry about. Now all I have to do is read 300 pages for three more of my classes, and do the pretesting, although it won't let me on right now. maybe when I am done with this assignment I can get connected to the pretesting, but if not I will have to wait for tomorrow to do that, because right now I have to go buy some more books. Then I have to go eat, because I have not eaten all day and after I eat, I have to go read about Russian ecconomics. After that it will be time for class and then I have the pre-law fraternity meeting tonight. After the metting I am going to go home and go to sleep right away, because I have been up since six in the morning and I am tierd now, and I still have laods to do. So I am done with this for now, I have to get started on the rest of my schedule.  "
Tell me about yourself.,"This hasn't been a good day. We had an assignment due in English Friday and I just found it in my backpack along with someone else's. How did it get there? Don't ask me. It has been raining all day here in Houston and it is as always hot and humid. I was going to ride my horse but the rain is preventing me from that too. I am watching my house and my little brother while my parent dig for rocks in Arkansas. They are visiting my older brother and his wife. I don't see him much since he got married. I went to go see my friend who had a baby about a month ago. She was supposed to come to UT but now for obvious reasons she is staying at home. My older sister is having a baby in November. I am so excited but sad because she lives in Cleveland so it is not very easy for us to visit her. We went over the summer and it was nice to go because all of my relatives live up there. I really want to go to New York City! My best friend and I might go over the summer and stay with my suite mate. My best friend is going to A&M. Why? I have no idea but I miss her like crazy. I have never had a best friend that I connect with like I do with her. I saw her this weekend in Houston. She came back for the Clay Walker concert that someone had asked her to got to. Our homecoming for our high school is next weekend so I will see her again at that. My birthday is coming up and I am excited I guess. I already know what I'm getting so the surprise aspect isn't there this year. I do get to go do an experiment with spiders on my birthday, fun! I'm definitely not a bug gal. I can see the sun has come out now so when I'm done with this I'm going to go visit my horse. I miss not having him around. I have been riding for 8 years and been on this particular horse for 5. I tried every sport until I found this. I do like volleyball but being short doesn't help ones career. I went to the UT volley ball game and those girls were massive! They were like 6'1'', 6'2''. It was amazing to watch them play. I missed the football game but I heard we won big time so that is good news. I am anxious to get back to see all of my friends. I really lucked out like 7 of my really good friends go to UT. My older brother goes there and my younger brother wants to also. Guess the whole family will be there soon. I brought my car up there but it is a standard and my brother still hasn't learned how to drive it! Oh well more time for me! "
Tell me about yourself.,"I did it oncer in the 11th grade and my stream of concious isn't as intersting as everyone elses conciouses it seems. I like breakfast at Hardin House except for the fact that it closes down at 9 am the whole purpose of getting 10 oclock and 11oclock classes is so you can sleep until 9:30/10:30, but that doesn't happen when you have to wake up early. I hear sdomeone coming down the hall,  I wonder who it is. I think way faster than I can type. I wonder who is going to be reading this. probably some psychology grad student who can tell that I have hrrible typing skills,  the problem is that I reallt can't type withpout looking at the keyboard so I have problems with it. my sweetmate is ian the shower, she doesn't vbathe very much so that's is a refreshing thing. 5 minutes down. 15 more to go,  I wonder what I'll think about in the next 15 minutews, well 14 now. I need to call marlie back. that stupid psychology survey is always busy. I can't wait for my telesis to start woirking; I'm tired of using my roomates computer. I think she is tired of it to. have you ever noticed that even when someone types ""she is"" the reader usually reads it as ""she's"". I guess cause that's the way we talk. I like to write in journals and I guess that's stream of concius but I'venever been timed. matt fowler is a really smart guy. I still remember his stream of concious paper in the 11th grade. it was about chocolate mousse. hmmm. my roomates cousin is really goodlooking. I'm looking at his picture by her computer tright now. I think I'm trying to hard to come up with some thing cool to write down becasue nothing is runnign through my head right now, weell at least not slow enough to catch. I cannot believe I just let my vouicemail pickup my phone. damn, I am a devoted psychology student!  okay maybe I put that in there so matt would give me a couple brownie poingts. then again is this you reading this matt?  Is anyone readingthis or is this one of those do it for your own good projects?  I think this could possibly be the longest 20 minutes ogf my life, I really want to check my voice mail. I'm going to be pissed if the caller didn't leave a me3ssage. I wonder what's for breakfast tomorrow. I have a lot of reading to do before my classes. the problem with  college isd that everything can be put off until a later date. I've noticed that I'm hgaving a hard time not correcting some of my grammatical errors. can you imagine how hard this would be to read if I lewdft them all?  I guess it's jusyt habit. rhendi has really blonde hair. I can't believe I'm putting my name on this writing it couold possibly ber used as incriminating evidence  for what? I don't have a clue?  I feel sorry for whoever has to read these?  I wonder if Matt Fowler really wrote stream of concious or if he just wanted to sound cool so he planned it out? I don't like beer all freshmen guys are like trying to prove soething through beer I think. I don't know: just an observation. I like to sing I started my choir class today and I love it. so much better than highschool  besides the fact that everyone in there is a haus  my clothes are done strying. they're wrinkling because I still have 4 minutes lefgt to try and put my ming on a computer screen whoich is an impossible task. the words here represent about 5% of what has been runniong through my head. the number 5 and percentage sign are the sam ekey. wow. why are there so many houston people around? and everyopne from the nearby suburbs claims to be from Houtson too. I am not even going to read this?  Why? I'll never see it again. the girl sitting next to me in class today doesn't believe in God. it surpriised me,  I am the worlds most horribler typer. 20 minutes. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm sorry, but I just don't where people get the sensation to steel something and have no doubts or submission about it. Where does that come from?  What, is it inherited, or something?  Do people just walk around, asking themselves what they can do to make someone feel like hell?  I just don't understand how people acquire such moral standings?    I can't wait until it's my birthday. I can finally watch Titanic in the privacy of my own home. over and over again. Leo. over and over again. three and one-half hours of pure Leo. Ahhhh, pure heaven. I wonder how people like him handle their lives. I mean, I don't know what I would do with all the fame and fortune; everyone admiring and watching me. My life would change so much; I'm not sure if I would like it very much. I hate the media. They make so much out of the stupidest things. Why would anyone live on making up cruel and misleading stories up for money?  It just boggles my mind. It's just like those people who the government pays bookooes of money to count how many ""Smiths"" there are in the world. O. K. So, maybe not that specific job, but something just as if not more silly. Seriously, though, the media stalks you and just waits for you to stumble so they can take that one incident and twist it all around, and spit it out at people to get their ratings lifted, or their sales up. And, people (the audiences) actually feed on this. Hell, even I do sometimes. All those sleazy magazines that say stuff like ""see the first pictures of the boy who was born with 20 arms and 5 eyes. ""  Crazy stuff like that. It's ridiculous. But, I must admit it is pretty humorous at times. I know when I'm in the grocery line, I browse over the titles just to get a laugh. I can't believe it's already 4:30. Where did the day go?  Why is it that, when you get older, the time goes faster. It's not like it's necessarily the fact that you're doing more than when you were younger, so the ""time flies when you're having fun"" does not necessarily pertain. Well, I guess it could. I don't know. All I know is that even when I'm not doing much, the days go by faster. That kind of scares me in a way. I have so much I want to do with my life, and what if one day I wake up and realize I haven't done a thing. I mean, what if I went to the doctor today, and they told me I only had 3 weeks to live?  Then, what would I do. I wouldn't have the time or energy to do everything that I've always dreamed of. I wouldn't meet the man I am destined to meet and fall madly in love with. Three weeks isn't even enough to get to know someone really well. That's awful when people find out something like that. I couldn't even imagine what my reaction would be. I still remember when my uncle supposedly only had 3 months to live, and he lived 2 years before he died. But, can you imagine how painful and nerve racking that would be, not knowing if you were going to wake up the next morning?  I remember the last time he went to the doctor's. He sat in his office, waiting for the results to tell him approximately how much longer he had. First of all, how can any one approximate someone's life?  But, he sat there and listened while the doctor told him he might live another 6 months to a year. He just shook his head, and said ""no. That's not going to happen. ""  He said his good-byes to all the staff at the hospital, went home, fell asleep, and never woke up again. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I don't have to follow any rules except for the ones that I create for myself. As the days have gone by I have slowly but surely felt that I am alone. Not being without my family has created feelings of sadness inside. I know that all of this is just part of life and a certain period of adjustment that everyone in life must go through. I have done some crying and soul searching alone in my dorm room. I am expecting that my time in college will put me to the test and show me my weaknesses and strengths. I have been forced to come to terms with the fact that I am now the only one responsible for my well-being, time management, and academic matters. I must now assume total responsibility for myself. However I know that my family is always here for me as far as moral support is concerned and when I am in need of more money!  rrHaHa!  I am really feeling excited about being in Austin because I am closer to my sister in San Antonio and there is a wide variety of people here to interact with. I love to walk down the streets and see everyone, what they are wearing, how they are acting, and all around just what is going on. I consider myself to be someone who is open to people and their different lifestyles. Harlingen, the town that I am from, has the population at UT and it is a rather conservative place. If some of the people in Austin were to go down to Harlingen and walk the streets, they would get stares and be talked about. I love the fact that in Austin all things go. Going to class was somewhat of a nervous experience for me because I did not know what to expect. I found out that it was somewhat like the high school class experience, except for the fact that there were now hundreds of people in my classes. Also, I don't have to go to class if I don't want to. Although I could not see that as a possibility because I feel if I do that, then I will fall behind and lose valuable information. I feel really stressed because things have seemed to be going wrong for me since I got here. I have been misplacing things, tearing apart my room looking for them and then finding them right under my nose. I guess it is because I feel overwhelmed about being here at school. I just need to relax and enjoy this ride. I find it frustrating that parents and other relatives always give me the bad side of college, like, don't walk by yourself at night because you might get raped, don't spend too much money, don't do this and don't do that. Not that that is not valuable and understood but it's all negative. I like it when people are positive with me and say oh it's going to be great, you are going to have so much fun at college, you will learn so many things. My sister and her fianc came to see me one day and my future brother-in-law made college seem like the best thing in the entire world. He is now a civil engineer and all he could say was that he wished he could come back to college because he enjoyed it so much. He really gave my roommate and me a better and more comfortable sense of being in college, instead of the Oh my gosh, I'm so scared of college and I know I'm going to end up killing myself view that is usually portray by others. Overall I am a mass of mixed emotions and look forward to anything and everything that I will experience here at the University of Texas at Austin. "
Tell me about yourself.,"At my high school I graduated with a class of 23, and most of my classes were comprised of 5 to 10 students. Sitting in an auditorium with over 400 other students is hard to get used to. I try to sit close up to the front of the class so I don't see all of the hundreds of students behind me; I think it helps. All in all, I think  I am going to enjoy ""college life"". However, all of this studying is going to take some getting used to. I don't think I have read so much of textbooks my whole life. Also, I find the e-mail thing a little confusing. I didn't have e-mail at my school, and I wasn't online at my home computer so I am not up to date on all the terminology. I know I shouldn't be, but I am kind of ashamed to ask for help just to send an e-mail message. I am under the impression that most people who come into these libraries know just what to do, even though I am sure some people are even more in the dark about the whole online thing than I am. ( I hope! ) Lately, I find computers really frusterating. I am trying to get into the pretesting page for Psych. class, and this computer keeps telling me that the user is down. I have already completed part of the Pretesting survey, and I clicked done after each section so I hope it saved my work. Every day after my classes, I feel like I have a million things to do before the next morning, and sometimes I realize I get too stressed out over nothing. I'm learning to slow down and take everything one step at a time, instead of trying to do everything at once. I have also learned that if I write things down I will remember to do them, and I won't get stressed out worrying if I have forgotten to do a certain assignment. Although I was a little worried after the first day of classes, I don't think college will be so bad as long as I keep up with my homework like I plan and don't procrastinate like I became so accustomed to in high school. I like it that my classes are somewhat spreadout as far as class times go. This gives me time to experiment with the computer, and try to get some homework done. I hope after my next class, the city has the water fixed at my apartment. Last night really sucked because a water main broke and we were left without water, they cut off the water without even telling us. My roommates and I had to drive to Taco Bell last night just so we could use the bathroom and brush our teeth before bed. And for this morning we had to use our bottled water to brush our teeth. I never thought about how helpful water is until we didn't have any. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm planning a trip to South Padre, and I don't exactly have any real place to stay(besides the car). I guess I always feel a little more nervous about the state of my affairs before I do any physical activity during the day. I think that the endorphins make a big change in my thoughts and state of being. I enjoy physical activity to for the competitive aspect. Recently, I've come to enjoy more extreme sports such as mountain biking, street hockey, and surfing. These sports seem to add an aspect of danger which makes the adrenaline run even faster. It reminds of the Goo Goo Dolls song ""Iris"" where the singer writes about ""bleeding just to know your alive. ""  The mixture of hard physical workout and a sense of danger accompanied with adrenaline add color to life where it wasn't there before and give a sense of perspective to other areas of life. I can't help but wonder if this passage is being influenced by the music I'm listening to on the CD player. I think that it's probably still an accurate representation because I don't know  if music can do anything but influence or bring out different parts of yourself. Speaking of music I'm going to play guitar as much as I possibly can now because I've beaten the video game Goldeneye. I'd also like to start writing more. I haven't written in awhile and it's something that I've been missing. The opportunity to be reflective and listen to yourself is a wonderful thing which I haven't been taking advantage of lately. I'd like to publish a book eventually with the sum of a lot of my writing. It would be like a journal of varied types of entries which would open a gateway into the inner recesses of my mind, a window into the core of my being. There are many different enjoyable aspects to writing. In addition to the chance to look at yourself and life, the ability to meld your thoughts into words in the most eloquent way possible is a fabulous thrill. Speaking of acts of creation, I would also like to take more pictures with my new camera. I'm trying to expand my self as a visual artist through photography. I hope to capture a little of the essence of my experiences through the lens of the camera. I took some really good pictures on my last two rolls. The best picture appears to be the result of serendipity. I took a picture at Mesa Verde of some of the Indian ruins, and out of the shadows of the rocks, a giant face appears. It's an incredible picture. It's a better picture than I thought I'd ever take. I hope I have the gift of capturing beauty on film. It would be a neat talent to have. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I've been here for about three weeks now and its starting to feel a little more like home. I was really scared when I first left, and I questioned myself if I was really ready for this big of a step. Once I got here there was no turning back. I would feel like a failure if I had worked my way to this point and then chickened out. Being away taught me a little about love too. I always knew I loved my parents but that was mainly because it was pretty much understood. Now that we are separated  I know how much they really mean to me. It almost feels like I have lost them and I am thinking about all those things I wish I had said then. I guess that is a good aspect about college because it teaches you to appreciate the things you don't have anymore. Overall I really like it here. I like being responsible for myself and it almost feels like Austin is my home and not my family's. They will have to come to my city to visit me. I really miss my girlfriend Mandi. She is at A&M but she hates it there. She came to visit me here and fell in love with Austin. she is now planning to transfer here as soon as possible. That makes the future look very bright to me. She was the one person who was always there for me in the past year. I really think she is my guardian angel. She came into my life at a point where I was about to be headed downhill. I helped her in a lot of ways too. I am glad that she doesn't like it at A&M but I would rather her be happy than anything. She has called me countless times this semester balling. It frustrates me because there is nothing I can do for her. I just can't wait until we are back together here in Austin. That will be paradise. I can see myself living here for the rest of my life. It has a little bit of everything. If you want beauty, head for the hills,  if you want history, head for the Capitol, and Guadalupe is Texas' little piece of California. I am going back home to Tyler in two weeks. I don't think the town will seem the same. It already seems like the place that I spent my childhood but could never go back to and live. I guess it seems that way because I already know I am staying here for the summers in order to take some summer classes. My parents treat me like an adult now. I had one of the best conversations yet with my dad the first week of school when I was having a hard time. He really treated me like a man and that meant a lot to me. When I go back I plan to really show more respect than I used to. I'm starting to realize that my parents are not going to be around forever. I want to make them proud. "
Tell me about yourself.,"The incredible sense of freedom I feel is probably what I feel the most. I walk around looking at all the other students and I feel like all these people are the future of my children. College is one step up in my step ladder of life and I think it is overwhelming for all freshman. Right now I have this great motivation that I am hoping will last through the rest of the semester and hopefully the year. I'm glad to be away from home. I thought college (my classes in particular) would be horrible. My past professors in high school had warned my that I would HAVE to take calculus and most of my professors would be foreigners whose accents I wouldn't be able to understand. They warned me that I would be lucky to be able to understand their handwriting as well. Well things turned out totally different. My major is advertising which means I only need 3 hours of math, which I placed out of by taking the SAT II. So I don't have to try and solve a calculus problem ever again. I also don't have any foreign professors this semester either. Everyone's handwriting is quite legible and clear. I enjoy all my classes. Every teacher makes me laugh. I'm wondering if I'm just lucky or is college not as bad as everyone makes it sound. I love the technology that teachers use today. I love that if I miss a class, which I haven't yet, I can just hook up to the web and get my class notes for the day. The internet is clearly a life saver. I feel sorry for all the past college graduates who didn't get to benefit from the internet. Right now I am appreciating the fact that I can type without looking at the keyboard because I notice some people around me having some trouble. I've met a very diverse crowd of people within the past week and a half that I have been here in Austin. It's very exciting to know there are so many people around you that are from various ethnic origins. One thing that I'll definitely have to get used to is how I don't recognize anyone when I walk from class to class. In high school everyone knows everyone and at UT it is quite different. My older sister is a psychology major from Incarnate Word University in San Antonio. I'm eager to tell her all about my psychology class and what I learn. I've already read about her major and know a little bit more about it after reading it in our textbook. I'm looking forward to the rest of the semester and to more assignments which don't require a handwritten rough draft. "
Tell me about yourself.,"now the computer is making noise. I wonder why it does that. I have always wondered what makes the computer make that noise. it sounds like it is computing data or something. like it is processing stuff. I guess that is what it is doing but I am not really that for sure. there it goes again. it always does that. oh well. who knows. my name is Quentin and I am in psychology 301 with Pennebaker. so far I have enjoyed his lectures more than any other teacher. I am not for sure if it is because I find psychology interesting thus far or if he is just good and / or interesting in his way of presenting the material. Either way I enjoy going to psy. more than any other. somebody just made a loud noise from the kitchen. now they are getting ice out of the freezer. water sounds good. I am starving too. I wonder what we are having at the Phi Gam house for lunch today. it better be good. I am starving. I have had a bad headache all day too. I hope it goes away soon. it is probably just because I haven't eaten lunch yet. I t will probably go away when i8 eat. it usually does. tonight I have a lot of homework to do. Chemistry is keeping me very busy. I had no idea that Chem204 was going to have so much busy work involved. my muscles are sore today. I wonder if I will play catch with Scott again today. it will probably be good for me if I do. it has been fun getting outside and doing stuff. the rain might keep us from doing it though. it has been raining just about everyday. I wonder when it will stop. it is supposed to be raining so much because of that storm down on the coast or whatever. I wonder of pres. Clinton is going to get impeached. that would be pretty crappy if he did, not that he doesn't deserve it. he should not have gotten with Monica Lewinsky like he did. that was really stupid of him. I can't think of a dumber thing that he could of done. I bet Hillary is pissed. that has got to be embarrassing. the cowboys looked good yesterday from what I saw. that sucked that I had to do some homework during it and couldn't just enjoy the game. I wonder how long Aikman will be at he is supposed to be out for 4 to 8 weeks. I think that they will still do good without him though. it sucks that he is gone though, he is awesome. I never knew he went to UCLA until this weekend when they said it during the Horns v. UCLA game. I wish we would have won that game, but I really didn't expect us to. we played awesome in the second half. I hope that is caries over to the Kansas St. Game. if we would win that game it would be so large. I wonder if we are still going to be in the top 25 pole after this weekend. I hope so. we did look crappy during the first half of the game though. it will probably boot us out. Ricky did good, he better win the heisman. he is good enough to that is for sure. I wonder if all of my friends had fun in Cali. while they were there for the game. I hope I get to go to Cali. for some reason in the near future. I have never gotten to go there before. I think I get to go this summer with Jenny and her family if they still go. that would be fun. Mom and Dad head for England in about 2 weeks or less. they are going to have a blast. I wish I could go, but is have to stay for school. ugh. that sucks. oh well, I want to go on a cruise sometime too. I think that would be the most fun. I can't even imagine how nice those big ships must be. I have seen pictures but that is all. I hope I can go on one of those one day. maybe for my honeymoon. who knows. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I guess it's just freshman blues, but it seems to me that everyone here knows their way around and feels comfortable. I miss my family and home a lot. my courses seem pretty easy except my psychology course. I didn't realize how much I had forgotten of the precalculus I took in high school. I miss my high school crush. He comes here but I haven't seen him. Oh, well. I can't wait for this week to be over. I get to go home this next weekend. I was extremely bored here in the dorm over this past weekend. there was absolutely nothing to do. I don't know what else to write about but the assignment said not to stop so I guess I won't. I just realized something about myself,  I can't let myself misspell a word even though the assignment said not to worry about errors. I am getting slightly annoyed by some of the people in my hall. They are very loud and I haven't slept well the past few nights because of them. I really hope they don't get loud tonight. I really need a good night's rest. My chemistry teacher is so funny. Not because she has a great sense of humor because if she does I wouldn't know but because she has this thick French accent. it's just refreshing to hear someone that sounds a little different than everyone I know. Speaking of which, it is extremely difficult to meet people here. Sure everyone seems friendly but there are some very rude people as well. I guess I'm just too shy for my own good. I don't suppose I'll ever grow out of it. I didn't use to be this shy. I don't know what happened. I wish I could graduate from this place already. Granted, I've only been here a week and a couple of days, but I was recently reminded how much I hate school. I think I've figured out a way to graduate in three years with my ever so special degree. I hope I make a lot of money when I graduate so I can rub it in my brother's face. He graduated from college about two years ago and he thinks that because he's making thirty thousand dollars per year that he's rich. well I will hopefully be making about forty five to fifty thousand dollars per year starting out so maybe that will make him hush up. I'm still not sure if I want to continue to pursue this particular degree or attempt medical school. I did a bunch of research this summer and discovered that almost two thirds of all those who apply to medical school get turned down. I would hate to come to the end of my four years here and not be able to continue with my plans. I would cry non stop if I didn't get in because then I would have to go and find a job and wait for an entire year before reapplying to a school. It would be sheer agony and I don't know if I could take it . Plus I think it would disappoint my parents and it would just give my brother one more thing to throw in my face. Well it's just about been twenty minutes so I think I'll go back to my exciting life of doing homework non stop and feuding with my dorm neighbors. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Every class seems like it has so much extra work, I feel like I  will never have any free time. Other than the work though, I love college compared to high school. I love the freedom I have and even the new responsibilities. Right now everything is still fun, I'm sure though that I will get sick of cooking, cleaning,ironing, and doing everything else by myself pretty soon. I already miss my parents a little and my little sister very much. I can't wait to see her. I feel really bad though, because I promised her that I would come home and see her in two weeks, but I don't think I am going to be able to see her for another week. My mom said she was so excited that I was coming home. She just started second grade and I wish I could have been there to see her. It really sucks that I have to leave her, I feel like we may not be as close anymore if I don't see her as much. She used to beg me every night to sleep in my bed with me and at the time it was kind of a pain, but I really miss it now. I also really miss my boyfriend who is also back in Dallas. He came down last weekend, but I don't think I'll get to see him for another week either. He is really taking me going off to college really good. I figured he would be mad at me all the time for hanging out with other guys and stuff, but he has been really cool about it. At first he got really jealous, but we talked about it and now he is completly understanding. I really hope we make it through the year and mabey he can move down here next year!  That would be perfect. Ilive with my best friend so at least I have her here. I think it would be really hard to go to such a big place like UT and not know anybody. people do it all the time ,but I think  that I would get really depressed if now one I knew and trusted was down here. I really love it down here. Austin is a really awesome town, it has everything!  It is really different from Midlothian, which is where I come from. It is a small town 30 miles south of Dallas. We only have about two stop lights and mabey three fast food places. I think its really great though that I am getting the chance to live in a really small town and a reall big town too. "
Tell me about yourself.,"K. , now I'm writing, but I'm actually kind of confused about what to do. I never really had an assignment such as this one. I feel no pressure since its for a completion grade, so I guess I feel some what good right now. I feel excited about school because I finally finished my schedule and its not going to be so bad after all. I guess my hopes are kind of high right now. I was also excited about your class since I nearly did not get in. At first, the class was closed and so I gave up until I peaked on my roommates computer to see that there was an opening in your class, but it closed again right after I added your class. I also feel kind of stressed because I'm looking for a job at the moment to pay all of my bills and my rent this year. On top of all of this I am now taking more hours this semester than I have ever had, so I guess I have my work cut out for me this year. I am also anxious about finishing this assignment now, I feel compelled to look at the clock and check to see if I have now surpass the 20 minute mark or not. Nope, still got quite a bite of time left. So, lets see what else I feel. I also feel somewhat lonely because I had to leave my family and friends at home. Even though I have two roommates, they are kind of kept at a distance. My goal this year is to try to succeed at a job, if hired, get a 4. 0, not party as much, and meet more people. I like meeting people, they are all so different and its funny to see likenesses in some. I found that you can also find people that remind you of others you used to know and you automatically share the same felling of like or dislike for that person because of the reminder. Confusion and hopefulness is what fills most of me at this point. So, I hope that's ok. Part of the confusion I feel is because of this class. I went to the pre-testing section to fill out the form to receive the free hour but the connection was bad or something like that, so now I had to finish assignment one now and do the test afterward if I'm allowed by the computer. Ah, my time is almost up and I'm feeling that sense of accomplishment. Alright now signing off, feeling good, tonytone. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Everyone likes to party, but at parties, the girls are very stingy and very hard to approach. Even though I am polite and nice. I consider myself and average looking guy, not ugly. So I don't see what the problem is. So far, the first 2 1/2 weeks of school, I have not yet to meet a nice girl. I don't know what's wrong. It is sort of making me depressed. During orientation it wasn't that hard for me to meet girls. So far, I still hang around my friends that I had during high school. I want to meet new people as well as keep my old friends. I hope the meetings at FSA and VSA will aide me in meeting new people. The parties here are pretty cool though. I just wish they played different music. My neighbors seem pretty nice but they're total dorks. The girls on my floor are also hard to approach. I don't know if it's me. Maybe I'm thinking too much. The time I spend here seems to go by so fast. I get homesick quite often. I want to go back to Houston. Maybe the homesickness will go away as time pasts by. I haven't been spending quite as much money as I planned to spend. so far I have spent probably around 30 bucks a week. which is average I guess. My classes so far has been good. I just hate oversleeping. Right now all of my thoughts seem to be about college. College is sort of a different experience for me, but its gradually absorbing into me. "
Tell me about yourself.,"It feels like more time has passed and that my life has been turned upside down. Not too badly upside down, but it is definitely different. I had friends come home this weekend and I loved seeing them, but I also realized that college is different for all of us. I noticed changes in my friends that didn't affect our friendships but nonetheless were there. I loved having friends home, knowing I had people to go out with and overall just having a blast. But- it just reinforced the distance between us once they left. I love college and all the new people I've met- I just haven't had the time yet to make the kind of friends I had in high school. I understand this, but it's frustrating to go from always having 10 people to call and talk to down to maybe 4 or 5. I met some people at the Longhorn game on Saturday and it was awesome!  I just hope that that will keep occurring and soon enough I will have those close friendships with people in college. My friends and I also talked for quite a while last night about one of our friends who went to West Point. I've realized that I miss him but at the same time have mixed feelings about that sense of loss. In so many ways I wish he were here but I know that wouldn't be right. It doesn't make it any easier, just a little bit more complicated. I'm also trying to get over my frustration of living at home this year. I feel like out of 50,000 students, I am the only one staying at home with my parents. In so many ways it's not too bad, but when I go out with friends and they can do whatever, come home whenever and so on it makes me realize how much freedom I'm missing out on. A lot of it is that I am sad that I don't have the advantage of meeting people in a dorm and making new friends that way. It's also hard because so many of the people I am friends with are all living on campus and so it's a lot easier for them to get together than it is for me to get together with them. Anytime I have to come up to campus it's at least 20 minutes and a hard time finding a parking place. It just sucks because that's really the only thing I don't like about my college experience so far. It always makes me laugh when they talk about the freedom from your parents that college brings because I don't have that. This is an awful long time to write. I don't really know what else I have floating around in my head and I still have 10 minutes. School work is starting to kind of scare me. It's like oh I have a test in 3 weeks so I don't need to worry about it now and then I know that all of a sudden 3 weeks are going to have passed and I'm not going to be prepared. I love not going to all of my classes everyday. It makes it seem less difficult. The one thing that really sucks about my schedule is the fact that I have these huge breaks between classes. On Wednesdays and Mondays I have 3 hours between classes and 1. 5 between 2 others. The worst part is that I don't know what to do with the time and I can't go to my dorm because I don't have one. I'm starting to hope that the next writing assignment isn't to explain your feelings about college because that's what I've done in this one so I might be stuck at the computer for awhile next time. I'm listening to the Titanic soundtrack right now. I've been listening to it a lot lately. I think it's because it's pretty relaxing and it calms me down. The music is beautiful and it makes me think of the movie. I went to see Titanic twice. The first time the movie cut off in the last part of the movie. It totally ruined the effect and it really sucked because they turned all the lights on and well, you can just imagine. 5 more minutes. I'm really glad that I didn't have to work today. I feel sorry for the people who did have to go up to work on our first school holiday. I work up at the recreation center on campus and I love it. The people there are really cool and now there are some people who are my age. This summer when I worked there, there was no one under the age of 21 except for me. It made it kind of weird because they were all in a stage of life that I had no idea about and won't for at least another 3 years. One of my friends from high school works there and I like having her there. I hate the fact that we don't work together, but hey that's the way life goes. I wish I had more hours simply because that would be something for me to do with my down time on campus. Two more minutes. I never realized how long 20 minutes could be. I've found email to be quite handy with friends because I can email my side of a conversation in about 5 minutes instead of having to go through the pain of writing a letter, putting it into the mail and sending it. I have no mailbox so it makes it even more difficult to mail a letter because I have to go all the way to the post office. Whoever thought of neighborhood community mailboxes with no drop box for outgoing mail needs to be laid off of his or her job. Well looks like my time here is done. I guess I have one more to do but not until tomorrow. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I have a horrible headache and I don't want to read for my other classes. My mind keeps wandering off into the conversations on the television. My head itches, so I am going to scratch it. I thing I am going to enjoy the business council . I am glad that I got on it I need to be on a organization. I wan to go to Cancun this spring break but my boyfriend wants me to meet his family in Chicago. I really would  rather go to the beach. I am listening to the television again, even though  it's in the other room, and I hate guys who date strippers and then they tell the girls to get out of it. Hey if you liked her as a stripper before then you need to like her the way she is. I am upset that I am missed the MTV music awards because I love music, if I could anything I wanted to I would quite school and pursue a career in the music business, even though it is so saturated. I just noticed that Victoria's Secret is having a huge sale on pajamas, I could really use some. I am noticing that my mind is shifting every direction. It is difficult to write about nothing and stay on a particular topic. If you gave me something to write about I would be able to concentrate, or maybe I just don't realize that my mind wanders so much. Isn't it like every three seconds. Oh this weekend was so cool I went to a foam party and I had a blast. I was up to my face in foam last night. I have never been to one of those before in my life. I probably would go again too. Because everyone was really mellow and just having a good time. Do Do, I am now singing a song in my head and kind of dancing. I was fascinated at dinner today because my roommate's father was telling all about his experiences with scorpions when her was a boy. I was pretty freaked out the whole way home. I kept feeling like something was crawling all over me. It was weird. I am so bored now, You said to be honest so sorry. I want to go shopping for some new winter clothes that always feels really good, I get so excited when I buy stuff and I look good. Well I need to workout first because I have become a little bit more flabby than I would like to be. My eyes are going blurry maybe I need glasses or else I am really tired. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Actually, I am sitting here in the library, wondering how my next four years are going to be. Am I going to excel like I did in high school? or am I going to have an exceptional amount of stress that I will not be able to handle it. I don't know. this whole college thing is so new to me. I just came back from lunch with my roommate and her friends from back home. It's funny because we just had the most bizarre conversation. I just met these guys for the first time and we were talking about how and if one can tell is he or she is in love or not. It's pretty complicated if you really think about it long enough. Sometimes when you meet someone of the opposite you're attracted to them right away. But what really attracts you to that person?  Is it the way they smile? The way they simply look at you?  what is it really?  After it's obvious that the attraction is there you have to move on to the next step. Which, for some people, is the hardest part. It's the whole approaching the person thing. You want to be yourself, but then at the same time you want to do something to impress the person. so you might comb your hair a special way or wear something new. it's the excitement that you like. It's sort of like a sandwich; the bread which is the first step, you the whole chasing thing. the meat is the relationship itself with extreme ups or extreme downs. Finally, the other slice of bread is either the break up or.  It's interesting because two individuals may be in love and might not even know it. That's the neat part I think. but how do we know. I wonder if we will ever know because how do you go about finding out. what type of experiments would you do?  "
Tell me about yourself.,"that's  a typical girl response I guess I still have about fifteen minutes left I tried right before this to take the pretest again. the first time I only got as far as the 27th question and it wouldn't let me continue now it says the line is busy or something like that I don't mind volunteering for experiments and I understand that experimenting is essential for the psychology students but I think that it is wrong for the department to force us to do this or they will block our grade and I have already been to mezes twice to try to sign up and there was no space left and the only space left was for males only so it's just a little frustrating I'm trying to think I don't type very well because it has been so long since I had to type anything I can't remember when I wrote an essay last my high school was a joke we only had 4 classes at a time for an hour and a half per class every day and we had finals four times a year although I usually exempted them you don't know how glad I am to be out of high school I really didn't like it there too much that might have something to do with the fact that we had 4500 students on one campus I really enjoy attending ut although I don't have a major yet everyone says that's okay but I would really like to get onto taking courses that specifically interest me I'm thinking about majoring in government with a minor in german but I might go into political science it's whatever I've so many ideas of what ""I want to be when I grow up"" that even includes psychology like everybody and their mom wants to do. I have about five minutes left I'm still hungry and after this I'm going to try to take the pretest again. yesterday I moved from the 12th floor of jester west to the 9th floor my roommate never showed up and this girl Nissa's roommate also never showed up so I moved into her room she's really nice and this is so weird: we are so alike she even has my birthday she lives in Missouri city which is right outside Houston where I live pretty nifty huh so we're going to go shopping and decorate our room some more it's going to look really cool I'm still hungry and I really don't want to eat that nasty jester food but I might as well because I already paid for it well not really the bill comes later this month anyway my 20 minutes is up and I'll be back here tomorrow to do assignment number two "
Tell me about yourself.,"I have so many things to do and not enough time. I feel like I am taking on too much. I know I can handle it if I get past these first few weeks, but right now I feel overwhlemed. I am stressed out with all the reading I have to do. I am such a slow reader and it takes so much effort for me to concentrate and take notes. I know though that I am a good notetaker and if I take the time I should do well in my classes. I am just too tired and stressed right now. I wish I could be at home where no one would come in to bug me or try to use my things and my computer. I am so frustrated with my roommates using my computer. It is new and I am worried they will mess something up. If I make it through till next Tuesday I will be ok. This weekend will be fun though so I just need to relax for once and enjoy it. I miss my family when I get stressed out like this. I keep telling myself""If I can only make it till December. "" It is not that I dislike UT. I like my schedule and my professors, but it is just so different. I know this will be one of my hardest semesters, so with God's help, I will make it through just fine. I just need to relax and enjoy it. I am so determined to make a very good GPA this semseter that I hope I am not dissapointed. The scholarship requirements are good because it gives me a reason to work for them. Actually, I think it scares me more than it helps. I want to make good grades for myself. The scholarship makes me afraid of failure. I am such aperfectionist that I hate failure. I am determined to make a good GPA within my 15 hours. I want to prove everyone wrong who tells me I should have taken 12. If I took 12 I would be in summer school forever. I know I can handle it because I did so much in high school that I am prepared forit. I also don't care if people make fun of me for studying too much. It will payoff when they do bad this semester. I think I just need a break. I am caught up in my reading, but I need a week without 10 different activities for me to do. I just have to have confidence in myself that I can do it and things will get easier as the semester goes on. I felt so good though last night when I got 2 dates. Maybe I will meet some great guy while up here. I was beginning to have my doubts. I am excited about football season beginning. It should be fun to see all the college games. I love college football. I hope we do well this year. I feel like I am running out of things to babble about. Or that all I have done it repeat myself over and over. I guess it doesn't matter as long as I write what I am feeling. All I  hope is that I get everything finished early so that I can go to sleep early tonight. I think I will be able to do that. Well, maybe tomarrow will be a better day. I can't wait till there is nothing going on that I have to go out for. I am sure next week will be better. "
Tell me about yourself.," I feel very awkward about having an assignment that doesn't give exact specifications as to what is supposed to be produced. I know I'm supposed to write about what I am feeling, but that is a very difficult thing to do for me. I don't usually tell anyone how I am really feeling ever. I'm worried that I might not be studying as much as I should be. I don't exactly know what to study for any of my classes. I mean I know I could read the texts, but I really don't think that would do me any good since I have yet to be lectured in any of my classes except for math. I hate math. I don't think my pre-calculus professor is very good at explaining anything. He is always getting side-tracked and making all kinds of mistakes. I don't think I'm going to do very well in his class and it really bothers me. I miss my boyfriend a lot. He is going to school in El Paso and I'm not going to see him for at least three more months. I tried living with him in El Paso for a couple of months but all we did is get on each others nerves. I was going to go to school with him, but I decided to move back to Austin because we were starting to hate each other and I missed my family a lot also. It's weird but we drive each other crazy when we are together and we miss each other like crazy when we are apart. I really don't understand it at all. I wonder about what he is doing a lot and miss him holding me at night. I know I need him and he needs me, and I really hate it. I have always thought of myself as the strong independent type who didn't need anyone, but I know the truth even though I would never admit it to even my closet friends. I wonder if my friend did okay at her new job orientation today. She was so excited when she got hired. I really feel insignificant sitting in this huge library, on this huge campus, in the middle of a huge state, writing about what I am thinking. I mean who really cares anyway?  People are always asking you how you feel, but I'm pretty sure they don't care how you respond. I know lots of times I ask people how they feel and then totally ignore them afterwards. I hate when people look at me in queer ways. I always wonder about what people are thinking of me when they look at me. I wish I didn't care, but I do. "
Tell me about yourself.,"college is amazing. my room, roommate, suitemates are all amazing. however, that call home always does it. I'm so in love yet my dad has to bring me down. I understand I'm only 18 and that they're thousands of fish in the sea, however, I'm in love with this one. I know I am because when I'm with her I'm the happiest man alive. yet at the moment, my feelings are so far removed from her. I understand that this is my father in my brain and my rational thinking has overcome my emotional side. he says not to let her visit, however, I must see her. he will not stop my but he's trying to open me up to the thousands of women here at UT-Austin. I don't know, I think about it every day. she's different then the girls I've ever been with. I guess, she's different then the girls my parents want me to be with. she is poor and has nothing to offer, yet I'm so in love. and I know. never have I felt this way for a girl before in my life. I would do anything for her, I mean. this assignment of writing for 20 minutes is nothing. I could sit here for 20 hrs weighing the pros and cons and just keep writing. its not  a difficult task. she is not causing me to be depressed. you know?  how people can sometimes get all depressed over their long distance relationships and stress out. I am eating like a madman as always. going out at night, WITH GIRLS, and partying. you know?  I get my homework done and study hard. I work out, pledge my freaking frat and play lacrosse. I'm doing everything and performing well for me as well as my parents so why the fuck can't I just be allowed to have the one woman in life that makes me happy. I understand that I'm young, yet this relationship is not difficult for me. its the second time I've ever been in a long distance relationship. the first one was a bust and I vowed to never do it again. so this past summer  I went to camp sabra at the lake of the ozarks to be a counselor. well, I wasn't intending on meeting anyone, however, I believe 100% that that word called 'fate' has true meaning. the first day we hit it off. I wasn't intending on anything. all I wanted to do was have a productive summer and come to UT free of love. however, you can't control love when it is real. it just happened. and I don't regret however I sometimes wonder if I didn't have her, what life for me would be like. I mean, I'm with all my buddies. they don't have girl friends or anything coming into UT and its not like they've all of a sudden found someone. I understand its only the first week, but I truly believe that what I've shared with this gorgeous somewhat deprived southern belle from Nashville is impossible to ever experience with anyone else. of course I could experience love with another baby, but do I really want too?  I mean, there is no way that the things we have been through together can ever be replayed. I know deep down inside that I am in love with this girl. its tough because she's not here. but what if she was here?  lets say she ends up going to UT or acc, as talked about next year?  what if my girlfriend is here dad?  what if she lives in Austin?  then what, I mean I've got a girlfriend at school now, right?  its not like this is killing me. or maybe it is. look, I'm in love. I know I am. with my love, I have no worries whatsoever. I don't think about anything else when I'm with her. I'm completely content. so get off me. I'm planning on keeping my studies up the whole year, I've signed with a wonderful fraternity, I'm playing lacrosse for the university of Texas-Austin. I have an active social life. not to brag, you know. but I'm doing everything a college boy should be doing: I'm enjoying myself, and to let this get in the way is ridiculous. one must understand, this situation is not in the way. its not holding me back from talking to other girls. however, I do not become intimate with these ladies. so what?  I'll be fine, I will see my love when we visit. I just don't understand. its very stressful, but I'm handling it. you see, my older brother went through the same kind of shit, but he screwed up. he wasn't able to function and messed around freshmen year in college and ended up on academic probation. I thought, damn what if that happens to me?  but its not a worry. I'm at college, its awesome, and I'm doing just fine. we're not holding on to each other. we are in love and have so many dreams we want to fulfill. its not like I'm crying all day to my buddies that I missed her. I rarely ever do that. I'm 120% functional. you know?  I don't know, I really don't know what the hell I just spattered out. I'm in love g-d damn-it. and I'm happy. I just have to relax and get my father's controlling voice removed from my head. I hope I fulfilled the assignment. its been 20 minutes of continuous writing. guess what, my mind still tells me I'm in love. ain't that the darndest thing. alright, time to go ponder. maybe I'm relieved now. see you. "
Tell me about yourself.,"However, after becoming sick I began to notice how much I was dependant on my mother to help me , and take me to the doctor and pick up any medicines I needed. Now I have to do it all on my own. I had to wake up in the middle of the night and take myself to the hospital, I had to pick up my medicine, I was now the one who signed the form for my treatment to occur, not my mother. Now it is all me, and in a way that kind of frightens me. I now have to wonder if I am doing things right, or if I am screwing things up. Also, I keep thinking about going home this weekend for the first time, and I am not quite sure if I feel ready to see some of the people I graduated with. I am really excited about seeing my parents and friends, but I am really dreading going to my former high school's football game. Then all of this brings up another thought into my mind. Everyone so going to make comments on the fact that I still don't have a boyfriend, or that I am too picky when it comes to guys, and all of that other mess. All of this seems so superficial when I look at it, but this is the stuff that I have been thinking about. I have met several guys that I am really interested in, but it seems like there is always a problem. I always seem to be able to pick things out about guys and turn a perfectly good guy into a loser. I can pretend that I like a guy to suppress my feelings for wanting to be with somebody, but I can't last more than two weeks with that person. I can try and try to make things work out but I always seem to push guys away, which my other believes is her fault because of her and my father's divorce or something like that. I just seem to get scared when a guy gets to close to me. All through high school, all of my friends dated the same guy, and I was the one who had a different guy in every dance picture. I am unable to totally figure out what my problem is , but I am hoping now that I am in college I will ""find myself. "" "
Tell me about yourself.,"I don't know a lot of people in every one of my classes and that makes me nervous and anxious. I guess I also am feeling very excited too. I am away from home, from parents and rules, and away from people I know. I like familiarity. That is like a comforting thought to me. I can't stand the fact that this school is so huge that I don't even know where my next class is. All I want to do is curl up in my dorm bed and stay there. Even though I don't like my bed at all because it isn't like mine at home, it will do. I am excited about the weekend that is coming up. I get to go home and see my family, my boyfriend, and my friends. I wake up every day from the day I got here to look forward to this weekend. I don't know why, but I guess I am lonesome. In addition, I didn't make the Longhorn Band, which was very upsetting to me. I am very upset that I didn't make it because I knew I could have. It's just that in the back of my mind, I knew that if I make Longhorn Band, I wouldn't be able to go home to visit as much I want to. So, I really didn't give the audition my best shot because, as much as I wanted to make it, I didn't want to just as much. No matter which way I looked at that, I guess I feel good that I didn't make it and I regret it because I wanted to make it also. That was a conflicting feeling that was bothering me too. Another thing that scares me is that I made the decision to take Chemistry even though I did rather poorly in high school. But something in me just wanted to take it and prove to myself that I wasn't dumb in Chemistry. I just am stubborn when it comes to giving up. I can't stand it when I can't finish something or I am not good at something that I could be. Maybe that's why I am so confused about the Band thing. No matter what, I want to kick myself for not making it, but on the other hand, I am jumping for joy because I know I won't be as stressed out and have time to do stuff. I was in Band all through high school and I guess I decided to continue in college because it was a familiar thing for me. Plus, I had such a bad experience with band directors that I was rather wary of the ones here. But I made such great friends in Band that I am afraid that I won't have any while I am here not in Band. Another thing that worries me is that everyone tells me that I will change and stuff and they say things like, ""Oh, you're probably going to 6th Street and party all the time. ""  Even as a joke, I found that very insulting. How do they know that I will change?  Yes, it's true that I may change, but I have rigid moral standards that were inhibited in me from the day I was born so I don't think the changes will be that drastic or horrifying. Whenever anyone says that, I get really annoyed and frustrated. Another major thing I worry is whether I will ever get used to the fact that I am no longer living at home with the ""comfort zone"" that I was accustomed to. I mean, I am afraid to go home and find out that people over there changed a lot too. It's troublesome to me. Like Chemistry. I also worry about the fact that NONE of the clocks run together and classes end at varying times. I am so scared to walk into a class late, making the professor mad or annoyed. That's another fear of mine that I can see happening and I worry very much about it. That is why I tend to run out of classes, even though I have plenty of time. I am the typical goody-goody that never disobeyed the parents and had many people that had high standards for. So I hope I don't let them down while I am here. No matter what, I can't help that I am who I am for others. I am the oldest of three kids and my parents always told me to set a good example for my younger siblings. If I screw up, they will too, as I was told. You have no idea what kind of pressure that is to me. I hope that I don't let anyone down, especially myself, whoever that is. "
Tell me about yourself.,"9 on the West Campus bus- please let me know if this will be a problem with the requirements of the assignment.  So what is this supposed to tell you?  Are all of my little Freudian hang-ups going to show themselves in my ""stream of consciousness"" writing?  ""There are no right or wrong answers""?  fine. I am constantly amazed by the blank looks on other peoples' faces when I pass them on the street or sit next to them on the bus-- are they really that dumb or do they just do an excellent job of faking it?  I sound like a big asshole, I know, but really, watching other people is my thing. lately, I guess they've just been frustrating me. I try to pick at least one person everyday and try to figure out as much as I can just by watching them. I'm probably way off base, and I don't presume to know everything about everyone just because I spend a while watching them scratch their heads and play with their hair on the bus never mind, I'm sick of this line of thought. I like to draw I play the clarinet and the piano I have a boyfriend named Zach and a dog named Simon-- sometimes they're similar  I wonder how flammable my dorm room is. I wonder how long it would take the chicks on my hall to realize someone is barbecuing in their room. the frat boys are having a shindig of some sort outside my room and I wonder what the significance of the word WOO is- they say it all the time. I used to think I was an alien and sometimes that comes back to me I used to think a lot of things because I had way too active an imagination when I was a kid-- this is something no one should combine with drug use and I figured that out pretty quick sometimes Zach really annoys the shit out of me-- if I'm an alien, so is he- just another galaxy he thinks I'm a bad driver and this just makes me want to cross big lanes of traffic and slam into a concrete wall just to prove what a bad driver really is. I also remember too much I don't like my fingernails much I wish I could play the guitar  I also wish I could make a perfect clay figure of my head so I'd know what it looks like to talk to me has it been twenty minutes? no. I'm looking at a screen full of garbage- how am I ever going to write a manifesto that will capture the imagination of the world and rocket me into super powerdom. if that's even a word. I do want to rule the world- a lot of people say that, but I really mean it my goal is to achieve greatness the only problem is that I have no idea how to even begin or what greatness even means to me I want to subsist on pomegranates entirely I have a really good relationship with my brother- he's really cool I had a dream that I could fly like a beetle I bet you don't even read this, do you?  so I could say that I want to kill the president or burn down the tower and it would go unnoticed?  I think the tower should be coated in Vaseline. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I have gone to three computer labs this morning, and have gotten screwed out of all of them. It started over at the UGL, where I signed up for a Mac, but saw a free scanner, When I sat down and logged in at the scanner, I realized my other assignment had come up. I decided to logout of the scanner because you're not supposed to use a scanner computer if you're not going to scan anything. So I went over to my assignment, but it was someone else's computer!  So I decided to sign up again (disgruntled). This time, though, the line was about a mile long (not really, but still REALLY long). About half way through the line, and a few minutes later, I realize that I had been assigned to a different computer, but my time was almost up. So I ran over to the computer and quickly typed in my password, but it wouldn't take it. I desperately attempted to logon before my time was up, but the insolent computer would not give it up!  Now a little less than happy, and a little more than frustrated, I went back to the line. Only this time it was at least twice as long. NO!  I remembered though, my MISS professor talking about a business lab, so I went over to the CBA. Of course it was on the 5th floor, and one of the escalator's was broken, but I made it up there; just to find out I had to sign up and wait a day so they knew I was a business student. How asinine!  So I signed up (trying to dig my pen into the page) and proceeded to the good old Welch laboratory, where there is always room to work. There were plenty of computers when I arrived, so I sat down (a little relieved) and pulled up Netscape. The soul purpose of my computer escapades was to check my email and to do this darned project, so I tried to get into my account. ""THIS FILE DOES NOT EXIST?"". What? ""THIS FILE DOES NOT EXIST?"" Damn it. Of course, the computer couldn't do email. SO I switched. Same song, second verse. I tried three others, and still the same chorus: ""THIS FILE DOES NOT EXIST?"". So I accepted the fact that somebody doesn't want me on email. I'm now trying to drudge through this assignment without breaking anything. And yes, time flies when you're having fun, but it moves as slow as hell when you're pissed off, wet, and hungry. That's about the only thing I have to look forward to now: eating. Luckily I packed myself a lunch today. Last time I neglected that responsibility and was forced to eat at Wendy's. $5, and I felt like cap for the rest of the day. I'm trying to stay healthy. You see, last semester, I worked out really hard, and got pretty buff before the end of school, but throughout the summer, I lost access to the gyms, and I lost a lot of my muscle mass. Now I am struggling to get back in the swing of things, and fast food really sets me back!  You can add that to the list of anxieties, too. Working out for the first week is always hell, but now I'm on Creatine, and I am twice as sore. Of course, now my hands are hurting from typing straight for 20 minutes, but that is bearable. I guess I sound like quite the whiner, but I am really an easy going guy. I always try to have a pleasant disposition; I really do, I walk around making a constant effort to keep a smile on my face ( It also makes it easier to wink at the girls). But today, things just aren't going well. I really wanted to check that email because I'm supposed to be getting a message from this GORGEOUS girl. But oh well, maybe my lack of correspondence will serve as ""playing hard to get"". Well, 20 minutes is up, and my hands need a rest!  Hope this is what you all wanted! "
Tell me about yourself.,"I have at least forty- thousand different things I have to do and about forty thousand different things going on around me  For one, my parents are out of the country, so it makes everything that much more complicated  second, I have been so busy with my sorority pledge class that I haven't really had time to do homework. just for the record, I feel completely overwhelmed right now. anyway, I went home this weekend just for one night and although it was extremely relaxing, it turned out that it was completely pointless to go because almost my entire family is out of the country. so I go anyway and have a great time just relaxing in my empty house with my dog and the tv, but I forget to bring back with me all my toiletries and makeup  luckily enough for me one of my best friends also went home this weekend and is coming back today, so I had to arrange with her a plan to get my stuff before she leaves that was a total fiasco because as I said before my parents are out of town and the only person who has a key is my aunt but Becky, my friend, doesn't have a car so its just been crazy like that  so I get everything figured out with her but meanwhile my cousin who was house-sitting my house decided to come up to austin so I gave him list of things to bring from home, but we can never find a time when both of us are free so I still haven't gotten my much needed chemistry and calculus notes from high school (or my sunglasses)  its not that big of a deal its just that I really truly need this stuff and the fact that he was so close to my dorm and we never ended seeing each other. oh well I guess he can FedEx the stuff up to me  that way I'll get a package, that is really cool since I don't get any mail anymore. oh and I haven't even mentioned the fact that my computer just does not want to work. no matter how many people play around with it, it still wont work right now I'm using my roommates computer which I have to say is a lot easier to use than mine  I've had a total of I think 4 different guys in to look at my computer, two professional and two of my friends and no one can fix it. the last professional guy is sending someone else tomorrow to look at it because he's ""really good""  at fixing this sort of problem  also he has better tools for the job. its getting really expensive to keep paying these guys to not change my computer  oh well I guess this counts as one of life's unexpected expenses  my parents always warned me about these unexpected incidents that cost a lot of money and I guess they prepared me for it I guess that's why I don't like to spend my own money by writing checks instead I prefer just to charge it to my parents I just wish they wouldn't get mad about it now I'm totally kidding  I have a monthly allowance now and I'm not used to it yet it takes time to adjust right?  overall, I am enjoying college I just have a lot on my mind and a lot to do not that that was any different in high school I was really involved in different organizations and I was in all AP classes so I did get stressed quite easily  I've been meeting a lot of new people of whom I love so far and staying friends with all of my best friends all of my friends live in my dorm so I'm really lucky to be able to experience college with them   "
Tell me about yourself.,"so I'm sitting right here and my roommate and his girlfriend are abut to go out to sixth street. I have no real plans for tonight so I decided to do this assignment instead!  it's been sort of a crazy week. lots of things have been bugging me and you know no ones seems to care about some of the stuff that I'm going through right now and yes I am going through a lot of personal problems but I don't want to write about those because I've talked about them enough this week ok, my roommate and I sort of get along but I'm never really sure how good of friends we really are but who cares I went to see loveline tonight and some people asked some pretty crazy questions people are so afraid of sex in this country I mean really everybody's thinking about it and that's all anyone really cares about I mean sure there is friendship and all that but come on sex is part of it too. how many friendships develop over some kind of sexual relationship or develop because someone needs advice about a sexual relationship? sex sex. it's like the underlying cause of all of our actions (who we make friends with, how we act, dress) and I'm not having much but that's another story. I mean I don't have that much of a sex drive to begin with, I personally think that sex and intelligence are somehow related-cause stupid people are always having it with other stupid people. you never see two brains getting enough, maybe its like a hormonal thing that people with low ig just have more testosterone although my best friend in high school was the valedictorian of our class and she was as horny as they come. maybe it's just me. sex creates too many problems, issues but its like we all need to express those feelings and I haven't been able to  oh well it's been 20 minutes and I'm tired "
Tell me about yourself.,"it is about 93% hispanic and 5% anglo and 3% other. my house is an hour west of south padre island, where my family owns a condo at suntide I and a sailboat in which we dock it at the sea ranch. I will arrive home aroung four thirty or five to go back to my highschool and surprise my boyfriend jason. he will be practising basketball when iget there because he doen't expect me home till six. then I will go home and see my mom, sister,and dog cocoa. cocoa is a chocolate lab that has been missing me very much . she gets extreemly excited every time my boyfriend goes over thinking that I should be around there some where. around seven I will leave  to go to about an hour of a football game. see the cheerleading squad that I miss and the band march which I miss just as much. then from there iwill leave and go to the beach, with jason. my mon and sister willalready be there. when I get there my mom promised to bbq my favorite foods, since the dorm food has already gotten old. then at the beach I will spend quality time with my family and take cocoa for walks on the beach, where she loves to run in the ocean and chase sea gulls. I most importantly can't wait to take those long romantic walks on the beach at night with my boyfriend, whom I love and miss very much. on saturdaymy dad and little brother will meet us there after the hunting trip. sunday my  neighbors will come down. they are my family down there because our closest relative is in wisconsin. they will bring all there children, which adds up to seven. my boyfriends parents and little brother will also be meeting us down there as well. I can't wait to spend time with all those people, and  tell them about my new family up here. I just got into a sorority, a week ago tomorrow. alpha delta pi  is the one that I got into, and I love it. they make us study ten hours a week at the house which I think will a positive thing for everyone. however I will miss my roommate this weekend. her name is alyssa bauer and is also a engineerig major like myself. I'm going into civil though and she is going into mechanical. but we get along very well. this is her lab top that I', writing  this assignment on right now. she is so sweet. she is even saportive of me being in  a sorority. and we went pot luck.

Tell me about yourself.,"I wonder if he is thinking of me????  I am glad I am finally getting this done cause there is no need for procrastination now. I need to do all this as soon as I get it. I had done this before but I could not submit it. I have something special with Alex and I know how he feels and he is different. he isn't like all other guys he is innocent and pure and he would not hurt me. I hope not to hurt him. I need him and need someone like that. someone to take care of me and to be there for me if I need to  talk someone to talk to me and someone that I can take care of and love too. he is perfect in my eyes and although he might not know that he is he is wonderful. he will never know I guess. he is there for me when I most needed him. he has held me when I cried and has made me laugh when I was sad/  I owe a lot to him. we have spent a lot of time together and it has been really fun. I wonder if he knows how much fun I have had with him. I don't think he understands. I am going through a hard time and I am going through a big transition, but I think I am doing fairly well. I have not cried much. my roommate went home this weekend and I felt kind of lonely cause we are used to going places together and it felt weird to  come home and be alone and not have someone to talk to or even argue with. we had gotten into an argument before this weekend and the time that we were apart really helped us understand each other. we are okay now. my exboyfriend has given me a hard time too. I don't want to be with him anymore, yet he still persists. he know that I am dating Alex and that it is over between us yet he still calls and he still asks questions like where were you and who were you with. I want to get away from that I am tired of having to answer questions about my own life. I want to be free and to be able to do what I want and that I think is right not what other people think I should do. it isn't fair to me  if I have to make someone else happy before I could do things for my own freedom. it important to be free because without freedom a person is not happy or simply can't be an individual. there are many things to do here in Austin and many many people to meet and make friends with. I have had a good time so far and I have enjoyed going to class and learning. although I do think that I should read a little more. I will be fine though. Claudia and Alex will be there if I need anything. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Mom shpuldn't worry about me not being htere to answer the phone-I just missed her is the funny part. I wonder if dad misses me as much as Crystal dad does her. Care bear watch. That was interesting activity in theatre class-I loved that girl's folder from Italy. I wonder if that director thinks I totally butchered Moliere. My monolague who cares. Why does Kyle like Meghan-she's sucha  tomboy-adn I'm not saying that because I think he's cute too, but because she is-but that'sn mena she's really sweet also. Sort of. I need to study for this biology class. I've got to get ahead on my reading. Psychology is so differetn from the way6 my mind works-I'm a math and science person. I think with  numbers and diagrams. Crystal wants to be a psychology major-that noise is bugging me it sounds like a cd player  being loaded and unloaded. That guy I talked to the other day is such a hottie. Floor 16 I think-I might just have to get lost up there. Got I need to read!!!Luke is so cute for writing me-why is it my ex can't say more than three words to me but his best friend can send letters and everything. Math class in a bit-my teacher is so bizarre. Really quirky- but just not all there. WHat is this complex that I have with people in a authority-I mean why just because they are over me do I find them attractive-it's so weird. I can't wait to see John Joseph next weekend. watch him be out of town or gone. That was a mistake. But, it was bound to happen. Why have I not really gotten homesick? is there something wrong with  me?Everyone I know has had some brush with  this , but I'm still fine-and, I lloove my family and there just wonderful. I need to call the Greek life board, the coppertank, and get that ink for my computer, let's see. can't call to this weekend with  the phone and trent has no wayt of hearing from me. IK wonder if a lot of people are going outb of town for labor day weekend? last year we went camping I was with  Ben then--he was a sweetie, but the breath thing got in the way. Is that shallow of me-I can't wait to see the people who were cast for this play? It's so highgly competitive. But there's sucha  rewarding feeling when you step out of that room knowing good and well that you produced something from your imagination and hard work and effort. I wonder if this is enough. HOw would they know if I stopped at 18 or 20 minutes-BUT I WON""T STOP UNTIL 20 MINUTES HAS ELASPED!!=) I'm starting to get hungry and some how I need to trek to rlm from here-I need to find the cam pus loop schedule. It's so quiet in this library I love it. This is the only place I can really study everyone is loud on our floor do they ever study or did they sign up for some course I don't know about. I'm so proud of myself I haven't gone out at all this week. Does Heath really like Sarah if he sayus he loves her that's such crap. Oh well time up, bye. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I never thought that college would be this overwhelming. I went to three classes today and I went ho9me and cried. How can I keep up with everything?  I went through Band Week and I sometimes ask myself is band worth it. When I am tired and sweating and just want to go home, I think of my parents and how they can brag in my little home town and the feelings of walking through the tunnel at the game and see 80,000 plus fans. At home 1,000 was the biggest turn out and that was big enough. I am very nervous about the first game. Where I am from our school marches military and UT marches more corps. I just know that I am going to mess up. I am all excited about school only being thirteen weeks long but fear that one and a half years of high school work equivalency are jam packed into these thirteen weeks. Good news though. I only have two finals. That is marvelous. I have to take a dumb SAT II test Thursday from 7-9pm and that means that I may miss band which I cannot. I don't see why someone who had five years of math in high school ()algebra in 8th which was a high school course offered for GT) has to take a stupid test. If I wasn't good in math I wouldn't have had five years of it and passed nor would I be an engineering major. Who knows. I called the department of mathematics and asked them about it. I tried to get a number so my teacher could call and try to see of something could be worked out and they were extremely rude to me. So I called the measurements and evaluations \center and they told me to call the department of mathematics. My teacher said "" welcome to UT""  This is a wonderful idea to have a writing assignment of continual thought because I can just vent about the worst first day of class I have ever had in my entire life. I have strong feelings that it will get better because it cannot get worse. I know that the first semester is the hardest but right know I don't care. While I was studying,  I was thinking about the kids that went off to college and came back at Christmas and visited about their first semester at school. Everything they said doesn't' pertain to me. Nothing they said pertained to me. I thought about what I would say if I was ever asked to speak about my first semester at college. My Calculus teacher stressed \over and over how we need to take the AP test. He said that we would slack off because we already knew it. For me I need this semester review. I love math and work hard at it. It doesn't come easy to me but I love it and no matter how hard something is if you love it you will work your darndest at it to achieve the highest possible. So I was thinking about if my calculus teacher asked me to come to his class what I would say if someone asked me why I didn't the AP test and if it were a smart decision, ( that was my cat walking across the key board. )  He wants outside because he knows that there are other cats outside and he wants to attack them. He's a 10 week orange tabby cat named Bevo-talk about school spirit. I think that I would answer the AP question as one that it is a personal decision. My boyfriend AP out of 408C and said that was the worst thing he did. Some people are happy they did. Another guy from home AP out of 36 hours and went to M&A and came home because he failed everything but PE. My \philosophy is that I need to start from the beginning in order to get used to things. ,  So what if I have already gone over this in high school I don't care. Why make things hard on myself with new material my first semester it's not like I'm going to graduate in 4 years anyway. I figured that if I took my basic chemistry and calculus things I know that I could get used to teaching styles college life and testing style. I will have to study and I know this real well, but It won't be all new to me. Well I started at 10:35 and it's 10:55. ,  I do have one question though,  if we participate in more than five hours of experimental stuff for our semester requirement can we get extra credit for that extra hour(s)? That's all folks. Good-bye and Good luck. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am very tired bc I have been studying all day for various classes. I know that once the ball starts rolling its going to be hell. This semester is somewhat full of crazy classes for me. I can't believe that I am having to take these evening classes I much rather have my 8:00 classes so that I could go to work and make some money now I don't what I am going to do. I guess become a male escort ha ha. I guess whatever pays the bills and gets me through college. Alsoo on my mind is the fact that I am kind of seeing 2 girls. I find them both very interesting and suitable for my needs. Neither of them are materialistic which is great bc right now I am broke all I have to offer is my heart. I don't know bc about 2 weeks ago I was pretty much dateless and desperate and now I am seeing these two girls and I have two others wanting to go out sometime. This sucks because they are all great girls and I don't want to hurt either of them. But I can see that something bad is going to happen bc it always does. It always happens this way for me one minute nothing and when I start dating somebody seriously I suddenly become attractive again. I am just going to go with it and not lead anybody on. Man once again this sucks!!!   what else am I thinking about GRADUATING. I am tired of the school life I want to be out in the so called real world trying to fend for myself. Then again what am I talking about I am in the real world littl help from the parents and paying all the bills with the itty bitty pay checks I get. If I didn't have conscience I would be out there on the street corner selling drugs bc this barley getting by isn't cutting it. No money horrible job and always pissed off bc of this. Why can't my parents be rich. I wonder what its like to have everything given to you and never having to work for it. I just want to know what its like not having to worry about how am I going to pay the bills. And day in and day out I see these kids on campus without a worry in their mind. But do they appreciate this or do they take it for granted?  One can only wonder but I would be willing to bet its all taken for granted. But I guess like my dad said ""son now your going to learn the value of a dollar and all those other kids handed everything will never appreciate anything they have. ""  Hes not a educated man by any means but I believe he is right on this matter. For that reason I keep on keepin on wanting to gradute wanting to please my parents and mainly wanting to please myself. Now that I have rambled on for 20 minutes I am signing off. "
Tell me about yourself.,"you would think that by now there would be no pain. ha. also on my mind is the extensive amount of homework that I have to do this evening. I am also very hungry. what am I going to eat? double-daves sounds good. or what about Chinese? god my teeth hurt. I should've grabbed the Advil when leaving the house this morning. Bummer. I would hate to spend another 5 dollars on another bottle but I don't know if I can go all day without it. I am also concerned with the fact that I just did an hour of pretesting stuff and its not connecting with the server. that could be a problem. ill have to ask about that today in class. it did take almost as hour. I would hate for that to be wasted time. this paper I have to write this evening is really stressing me out. john Winthrop and the Puritan dilemma. what a dilemma. actually it is rather interesting the way people thought back in that day. things have certainly changed. gross- I just rubbed my tongue back to that far forbidden corner in my mouth and felt the stitches. ouch. this probing throb is driving me bananas. obviously. I keep losing my train of thought. how will I ever be able to concentrate on john Winthrop. ill have to wait until I get home and pop a few Advil. or a few hundred as I am feeling right now. just kidding. anyway another thing stressing me out is the fact that my car is in the shop again. I dropped it off this morning and its almost as if my life is in someone else's hands. at least my checking account is. ha, what checking account is more like it. ouch. my freaking teeth. I am going to have to break down and buy some more Advil. that sucks. gosh it's almost 2:00 already. where does the time go? oh yea that pretesting thing and then trying to submit it. I have that it's not lost. maybe I should try and check somehow to see if I can send it through now. well its been twenty minutes. its time to go and get some Advil and relieve my suffering. Eckerd's is probably the least expensive. it kills me that I have to buy more of that. pain medication is not cheap. anyway enough bitching! lets go over to the pretesting website again. "
Tell me about yourself.,"college is perhaps the most unstructed, yet the most structured enviornment I have yet to face. Vague, vague, it's all vague, yet so remarkably specific. I can't help but thing about what I'm going to say next. I'm engaged in an activity, that's how I work. When I'm doing something, I try to do it with the most focus I can. To simply do it with no thought is, to me, a waste of mind. Back to college, I'm still trying to convince myself that I had no choice. Had I given myself the option, I would be a music major, but I didn't do what I had to do. I slacked off on my music, a thing I can never forgive myself for. Sure, in that time, I managed to develop my other skills in school, but what a becauset. I played viola for seven years to major in chemistry. Sure, some may say that just having played is enough, but for me, to not bring about one's work to full potential is not worth anything. I hope I go through with chemistry, then at least I can say I stuck with something. Listening to music right now, I think that perhaps I could have achieved that; maybe I still can, but it seems to far right now. at least the food is good, and my roommate is a nice person. I guess college will just be a test of how much I want to make a good life for myself. it's my brother; I'm so glad to talk to him; I had to leave him in the middle of the hardest part of his life (middle school); he was really used to having me there, but it seems like he's adapting fine. I hated my middle school years. The kids we mean and the teachers we less than happy to help out a shy little guy like I was. thankfully, high school was much better. College seems like it will be full of wonderful interaction, but I wonder how much interaction I'll be able to stand. I'm the kind of person who likes other people, but who also sees them as a distraction most of the time. and they always seem to distract when you don't want them to and disappear when you want company. I'll never figure people out. Well, this has been a lot of uncohesive thought, but I guess that's the whole point. adieu and farwell "
Tell me about yourself.,"I really could care less that I'm doing it at this moment. However, I care about my grade in the class, so that is why I am typing. Lately I've really been curious about the UT environment and atmosphere. It seems to me that everything that an authoritative figure has to say is always an understatement of what is actually expected. For example, one of my professors indicated within a span of less than ten seconds that we should read over chapters one through four for the next session. When I got back to my dorm room I opened the book, thumbing through the chapters, and realized that this man expected the class to read a total of one-hundred and fifty pages in two nights!!  I don't consider myself lazy, but this seemed like quite an astronomical expectation for such a subtle suggestion. College life seems to be okay. I have a lot of free time, but when I really think about it, time flies so quickly that my free time is gone. I like my math class but can't stand the discussion lectures. I feel that they are a complete waste of time, until we actually cover material that I haven't seen. When this occurs, I'm really in for it because I'll be forced to attend the lectures. I really have a hard time understanding the TA, because he gets so excited about math that he talks too fast. People who get excited about math should do the world a favor and jump off a cliff. Just kidding, don't come searching for me because I said a morbid thing like that. My sense of humor is pretty violent. I like it when people have desensitized themselves enough to understand and enjoy that sense of humor that I possess. There is nothing that I can't stand more, however, is someone that totally does not understand my sense of humor and thinks that I am some sick individual. Typing for twenty minutes really sucks. I think I am getting carpal tunnel disease. I've never experienced so much pain in my wrists. I think I am going to slit them right now. with a dull razor blade. Then I'm going to cut my arms off and beat my roommate over and over with them. Once he has experienced maximum horror, I'm going to chop off his leg and leave him there to wither and die and horrible death. Then I'm going to go dive off a bridge onto I-35 and do triple somersault face-plant onto the oncoming traffic. Hopefully I'll traumatize someone in the car and cause them to go off the deep end. I'm just kidding. Would never do such a thing. Anyway, classes are going pretty good, I'm getting a real good taste, as a Freshman, of what college life is all about. I really enjoy having a mission or goal if you will, to get to class, and actually completing it on my own without parent supervision, or guidance, rather. In general, I enjoy the individualistic atmosphere here. However, I have become quite disturbed with the fact that no one talks to one another, perhaps because of pride, shyness, commitment to fulfill an independent lifestyle. Whatever it is, I'm troubled. I have repetitively made eye contact with numerous females on numerous occasions, but they don't look back. I smile but they don't respond. what a bunch of robots. I've never, ever, ever, ever had trouble communicating with the opposite sex before. New challenges await me. Oh well, time's up, hope you've had fun over-analyzing me. Oh wait, my name doesn't really matter, I'm just another statistic, or another number. Got to get used to it. "
Tell me about yourself.,"You all are going to read this and say, Who the heck is this freak? The first day of the semester. Im tired already. I want to change to world half the time and its not at all working. I hate people sometimes and I like them the next. How can people lie to you, straight to your face and still not have any trouble what so ever sleeping. Have we no morals at all? All I can think of as I return once again to the glorious UT campus is how everyone is just paying to party; paying to drink, dance and meet people. I want to learn, but I want to have fun too. I cant believe that all anyone thinks about anymore is the same old same old; drugs-alcohol, sex and rock and roll okay so maybe its more R&B now a days. I must be warped. I want someone to tell me yeah it was a great weekend because I got to go here or there and I met with my friend so and so. Not Hey it was a great weekend, I got some chick to come back to my dorm and I got plastered. What is that? Am I the only one who thinks this way? I cant be. It just cant be that rare that I would be the only one who would want to do something besides drink and party 24/7. I must be jaded. Yes, Im a junior. Yes Ive been here a lot longer than half of these kids, fish, in our PSY class. But still, the campus is still a new place to me. Everyday is something new. I learn something new. I meet a new person. Something, anything. But something tangible. Im not talking about some whim like bouncing from party to party. Being pseudo friends and all. I try to be genuine. I dont lie to people. Im friendly damn it. I used to like people. People made me this way. All the mean rotten people in this world who want to lie to my face, cheat me out of my rights or just blatantly go out of their way to be rude and downright spiteful. How rude is that? I cant believe what our society has come to be. I cant wait to start learning how some people think. What makes our brain tick. Why am I the way I am. Why  that mean lady who cut me off right on my way home is the way she is, like she didnt see my blinker, thats what that stupid little light is for. I didnt pay extra to just have extra decorations on my car. As if. Then she honks at me, like I was in the wrong, she knows she was speeding up to close the gap. How rude! I want to know why they think this way. Is this like the beginning of all of this Armageddon story. Is that what the 21st century is bringing our way. Why are we all fighting. And why am I so cynical when Im only 19. I should still be a naive little student who loves the world and everyone in it. But still. There are such things as being right and being wrong. What ever happen to a persons word? I want to know. There has to be others like me who think this way. Im not the only one who thinks were wasting our time here. There are more important things to do in our world than worry about which frat is having the next party and whose dating who and all of that petty stupid little gossip things that buzz around the world everyday. You know it happens. It starts every morning at the water cooler or something like that and people just begin their little digs for the day. What is it with us. I hope humans werent always this stupid, because let me tell you were at a downfall here; crime, attitudes, lying, no morals, all of that. You know what Im talking about, dont you computer? Im babbling. I just want everything to make sense. It doesnt now. I dont know. I want the world to change, but how can it, when will it, what are we going to do. . . "
Tell me about yourself.,"I could talk about all the controversial issues that have swept the nation - Clinton's sex scandal, the terrorist bombings, or any other factor that is found on the news. I could also write about everything that is wrong with society, however these things almost seem too common in today's everyday conversations. What used to seem controversial is now somewhat the fad. People are running around with bad attitudes because they are the ""rebellious"" ones. It is truly not they that are rebellious. They are simply conforming to what is seen by the physical eye as rebellious. True rebellion is seen in writing. In the early years of the United States, people were hung and persecuted for their written work. I think that those moments should go down as some of the sadder times in our history. I think it was Hawthorne who was greatly criticized for his Scarlet Letter. He wrote about a woman who was punished for adultery, but was she really punished?  She had to wear an outward symbol of her sin, but I think that Hawthorn only included that to keep from being persecuted by authorities. The story was truly about the liberation Hester Prin found in her life. I don't think that is exactly what I was aiming at, but I am sure someone would understand. I like to think of myself as pretty well learned, however when I compare myself to others of greater intelligence I find myself utterly an idiot. While on the subject of intelligence I would like to take a minute to bash standardized tests. I do decently on them, however they in no way judge the full potential or caliber of any student. I feel as though there is something of importance that I could say, however seeing as I am the utter idiot, I find a rare occasion that I have anything interesting to say. I guess I would like to be a scientist in the sense of knowing knowledge for the sake of knowledge. I would like to soak up a lot of life while I have the chance but sometimes life gets in the way. I mean, sometimes I am trying so hard to enjoy life I forget that I am living it. There will never be another today. This is the only August 30, 1998 that I will ever experience. I would like to end it saying it was a day of my life well spent. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I miss so many things back home. I never thought I would miss anything. But I guess it's true what they say. You never know what you have until it's gone. The transition from high school is not that bad. The schooling is not the part that worries me. It's the living on my own that really worries me. I have always depended on others for my needs and now it is up to me to do it on my own. It does have it's advantages but it also has numerous disadvantages. I wonder what my girlfriend is doing back home at this very moment?  Maybe I should call and see if she is as lonely as I am. I wonder what everybody else is going to write on this same assignment. I hope I can make all A's in my classes this year. I have made straight A's forever and now I guess my parents kind of expect me to keep doing the same thing. I don't want to disappoint them in anyway. College is a very structured society. Everybody hangs pretty much with their own cliches. Like all the Frats and Sororities. Then you have the want to be frats and sororities. Then there's the people who don't care who their surrounded by. I wonder how and where I would be classified. I love this assignment. The thoughts just flow through my head like crazy and now I finally get to write them all down. Too bad nobody will probably ever read it. The mind is a very miraculous thing. I wonder how it works. And why we only use so little of it if it's so big. I wish I could go home right now to visit my friends and especially my girlfriend. I even miss my family. I never thought I would miss them. Just because I was always with them and before I left we had a lot of hard times. But when I left, seeing my mother and father cry was the thing that tore me up inside. I had never seen my father cry. I really hate good-byes. Why do we always have to part from the ones we love. No matter how hard we try, there must always be good-byes. I miss all my high school friends. I wonder how everybody is doing. I wonder if we'll have a ten year reunion. I would really like to know how they are doing in ten Years. I really haven't been able to keep in touch with too many of them. Some went to the Army, others to the Navy, and others to school in various places. My girlfriend is so beautiful. I really hope she is doing all right. I really care for her and she is constantly running through my mind as you can probably see. She just means so much to me and I worry about her all the time. Well, I think I have done enough thinking for right now, I will leave you now to go call her and see how she's doing. . . "
Tell me about yourself.,"I guess I'll use this space to rant about this topic. Yes, I used to have a car. She's a silver-blue '86 Camry that my mom bought when I was in first grade. She was the first new car my mom ever bought, and I think she made a good choice. She bought a new Camry in '96, when I turned sixteen, which, by the way, is the nicest car I've ever had the pleasure of riding in. Strap $15,000 to the dashboard, and you have a Lexus. But anyway, I drove the old Camry, Pretty Hate Machine (after Nine Inch Nails' debut album, which is awesome)until I went away to college last year, on my little sister's 16th birthday. So you can probably guess what happened to her (the Camry, not my sister). Yes she got two huge dents in it, running into the same garage behind the restaurant where we work, a garage around which I have managed to maneuver countless times without causing bodily harm to Pretty Hate Machine (which my sister so rudely calls ""The Velvet Rocket!!!""). OK, I crashed her once and busted her right headlight, but it wasn't my fault, and the other lady's insurance paid for it all, and I felt terrible for putting her (the car) through all that. Gill showed not the slightest sign of regret for her thoughtless actions, having no respect for Pretty Hate Machine.    She's such a great car. First of all, she screams ""MOM,"" so I never get pulled over in her, not even during the six months she had a busted headlight. She might as well have vanity plates that say ""MOM, RN. ""  Second, she's the most reliable car in the world, which is one of the reasons I felt bad when I crashed her, because she's not used to the shop at all. No, she's never broken down. She's got 150,000 miles on her, yes, she's ""been around the black"" a few times, rrhaha. She's never broken down. Third, I love her because she's idiot-proof. She doesn't just have that beeping noise when you don't fasten your seatbelt;  she turns the headlights and the dome light off when you leave the car, so you'd have to be worse than an idiot to run out the battery, which my sister did I might add. And you have to lock it from the outside, or else 1 door stays unlocked, so you can't lock your keys in her. She's the perfect car. Oh, and since she's so old and a 4-seater, she's cheap to insure.    Yes, I have a sort of sick emotional attachment to her, but she's just so awesome. She's like an heirloom, having been in the family long enough to serve two generations. I get to drive her whenever I go home, which is nice. It's hard to take her for granted when I don't get to see her that much. Oh, I forgot to add that We took our family Christmas card picture in front of, with me holding the keys out in front of my face. There was this really cute boy in high school named John King who drove the same car, except he had the windows tinted so that he could drive and be sketchy at the same time, I guess. Anyway, I thought he was cute, and the fact that he drove such an awesome yet practical was somehow really sexy to me. And this summer There was this guy named Jon who worked at the same restaurant I did back home who drove the exact same car, except his was more gray than blue. We somehow a big kick out of trying to park our cars next to each other, or opposite each other, or in some geometric configuration. What really kills about her is that every day when I pass by the UTC on the way to class there she is, parked right there, the exact same car, taunting me, torturing me. I miss my Ol' Girl. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I feel nervous inside and butterflies keep flying around my chest. This is probably because I am nervous about what my boyfriend has to tell me. I feel excited as well and it's pretty weird, but for the first time, in a long time, I know what it means to take advantage of ones individual strength. I mean I feel as though things will work out, but what if he tells me that the one and a half years we've spent together are over. Anyway, this has pretty much been on my mind since 7:00a. M. I can't really think of anything else but that. Gosh, I am so nervous, but then again I'm probably over reacting. Other things has also been on my mind like my first test in biology. I really don't know what kind of questions are going to be asked. I'm sorry, but I just feel so nervous and I think these butterflies have turned into bats or something because I can't even breathe without feeling more nervous by the minute. I feel pretty confident and I guess that's good. I guess I'll stop thinking about that for awhile and let my heart catch up to my chest pounding. On to another thing I was thinking about. I can't believe that Magwire guy from the Cardinals almost beat the record foe the most homeruns. Pretty weird that I jumped from one serious subject to another, huh?  That's pretty much the way I work inside. I get all worked up about something and then the next minute I'm laughing and having a good time. I know why that happens. I don't look at the bad things in life, I only look at the good things. It's bad for me to say, but I could probably walk down a dark street with no common sense and think that that street is the most safest place on the face of this earth. A lot of people judge a lot of things from the outside which is so unfair to everyone. Not everything that looks ugly or dirty is bad. In fact, the prettiest looking and the wealthiest looking people probably do more crime or illegal things what the ""middle or lower"" class would do. That's why I hate when I get my pay check and see how much taxes I pay for people to just claim welfare for something stupid. More than half of the on welfare are able to work, they're just too lazy!  I know this for a fact because my boyfriend's step-sister does that. So, basically, while I'm working my ass off for people like her, my money is lost and I don't even get that much taken out of my check for MY Medicare. That's what's so unfair!! Well my 20minutes have flown by so, I will write to you soon for assignment #2. good-bye and take care. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I don't know if anyone will read this or not. Right now I have a huge headache from that survey. Some of those questions are ridiculous. I am not sure how many people are scared of sleeping dogs. Anyway, the ""gay"" questions really made me think. All of my friends tell me that it is a sin because the Bible says it is. So I think I answered that question how they would of and not me. But I do feel that a gay couple should NOT be able to adopt a child. What kind of life is that? The child would endure unnecessary criticism. My boyfriend lives in Oklahoma. I miss him so much. It is hard to watch everyone else be happy together. My suitemate is constantly with her guy. Basically I am jealous. I don't know why. I never considered myself a jealous person. Sitting here talking about relationships, makes me want to call him. My phone bill this month is going to be out of control. My parents are going to kill me. School- I am kind of worried about the whole thing. I never had to try that hard in high school and I was in the top 10%. but everyone at Texas is somewhat smart or they wouldn't be here. I heard that Texas had to accept around 3,000 freshman that were in the top 10%. I was at the bottom of that spectrum. I wish it would be 20 min. already. I am so tried. I have large amounts of homework to do today. As I sit here there are lots of people passing in church outfits. I feel guilty that I didn't go this morning. At home (Houston) my family went every Sunday at 7:30. My mom is weird. Why would you go at 7:30 when you could go at 9:30, 10:45, or 12:30. She makes me so mad sometimes. Last night we got in this fight over plane tickets to Oklahoma. My boyfriend and I were going to split the price but she wants him to pay since his family has millions. She is such a snob. I never understood why though. Actually I am surrounded by a lot all the time. I just finished ""rushing"". What an experience!  I am so glad it is over. My time is almost up. I can't wait to stop typing. My eyes hurt and I still have that headache. I complain way to much. Alright bye.  "
Tell me about yourself.,"But I guess I'm supposed to be trying new things here in college. What's on my mind right now is the question at hand. So I would say right now I am thinking most about what's going on with me socially. I feel like I keep meeting all these girls and I know I'm never going to become more than friends with any of them. People tell me I'm too much of a nice guy and not aggressive enough when it comes to getting girlfriends. But who  really knows what anyone else is thinking or what another person wants. I for one have no clue what other people want from a friend or what a girl would be looking for in me but I guess that's the mystery of life. But it sure seems weird how other people seem to have things all figured out. Like my suite mate gabe, I mean he doesn't have to do anything  and everyone is like I want to be your friend and girls are like please have sex with me. I have a lot of friends but Its like I really want one girl to be more and I can't seem to get from being  friends with a girl to more but maybe its because I haven't met the girl I want to be more than friends with, oh but that's bull shit cause I know I've met plenty of very attractive girls that I would love to get with but never have. but what can I do. It also seems like some weird forces of nature are working against me on the social thing when it comes to girls or I mean my own personal looks, cause I have had a clear of acne face for over 7 months and then right before I move to college KABOOM, it hits me after I go one week without using my prescription cause I ran out. I refilled it but then again it takes awhile to work so I was going through the transitional period then finally a couple days ago i'm truly completely clear and then the next morning I wake up with this huge cold sore on my lip. The biggest monstrous blister right on my lip. that's really going to make me look good for the girls. And right now I still have this blister. I fell like I have to wait for the blister to go away before I ask any girls out like this girl I met at this foam party this weekend. I talked to her on Tues. but we couldn't get together but now I think I may try to wait till this blister goes away before I try to meet with her again anyway. rrGeez, my back hurts right now, hold on a sec while I adjust my seat. there we go. I am really rambling on about the girls situation but I guess that's what's really on mind throughout most of my college days. I also have the work but that just seems like busy stuff to me. to tell the truth psychology is actually so far my favorite class. Not only because there are so many hot girls there but because the actual material I think is cool, like this assignment for one. I might end up writing for way more than 20 min without realizing it. Well in psyche I met this girl Becky and we were walking together to jester and I just truly wonder if we ever become friends, sure we happened to meet and walked together to class one day and sit together but I somehow doubt it will happen again and that's just another example of me just becoming friends, because if I do see her again we will probably only become friends that meet maybe to study or something but I guess having a lot of good looking friends is better than no friends who are girls. back to school though I cla isn't that bad of coarse math is one of my specialties, and chem I like cause I like my professor but physics seems to be the same as high school, a boring monotone voiced professor who doesn't explain things clearly in my opinion, and I know I could get good grades if they just taught from the books cause I have the ability to learn very well but tests don't come straight from the text books do they. so that may pose as a problem, but I have a class in 20 min that I need to start heading towards so now that I've typed for 22 minutes I think ill let you go now, Later. "
Tell me about yourself.,"dreams are like the screen that shows these things to me, like last night's dream--  probably shows true feelings, but more specifically, true fears. fears about who the people I know really are, and especially the way that I feel about those people deep inside. I don't like to analyze them too deeply because who knows, I might find something too true or too scary to be true. then there are fears about who I am. sometimes I admit that I am afraid of relationships and of being hurt, but sometimes I admit that that is just an excuse for being afraid of something else. sometimes my dreams will reveal things I didn't think I could feel-- sometimes there is some energy in my dreams that I can feel for days. a lot of times I say that I am by nature an independent person, I work better alone. there are some people in this world that fall apart without someone to hold their hands, but I'm not one of them. I do need my family and close friends-- I couldn't even think about living without them. but how would I be with one person who is always supposed to be there, to be mine and me to be his. my romantic side loves that and believes in that; my independent side can't handle that. but I have often heard myself say that those people that are the dependent type still need to be alone sometimes. depending on someone your entire life just leaves you helpless when you are left alone. it shoes your weakness and vulnerability. but then again I guess for some ""lucky"" people they will never be left alone. I think that it is healthier to be alone first, to establish who I am before someone else can drill in me their thoughts and beliefs. I need to be my own person before I can become somebody else's, be strongly sewn in the ground so that he can't pick me out. depending on someone, or having someone depend on you takes a part of you away. it should be two people, as separate wholes, coming together, not one part making the whole. it is good to be open-minded, and I try to be, just not easily influenced. I try to be aware of the differences in each other and accept people for those differences but at the same time not let my true self be sucked in by anything untrue. my perception of strength is just that:  though available for those who look to you, staying solid in yourself. "
Tell me about yourself.,"the channel is tuned to MTV; so there must not be anything better to watch at midday. However, being inside watching crap on the television is better than sitting outside in the Hellish heat. When will the madness stop. I write these words in between my 2D design studio class at the art building in the morning and my psychology class at 3:30 PM. Myb studio class starts at 8 AM, way too early. I write from my apartment in south Austin. I get back and forth between school and my apartment by way of Capital metro. The bus is convienent  but not so convienent. I don't too much like this computer or any computer for that matter. Technology  one day my ruin the human race, we'll have to see. At the moment technology seems to be our best friend, our idle, and to some our lover. That last group of people don't really exsist. Materialism is the Western way of life. This is why we have so much apathy towards other humans we don't know. Some think that if we have our computer to talk to why do we need human interaction. We need human interaction more than we need contact with technology. I would rather have a good conversation with another human than a brief relationiship with a television, computer, or some other device. But what about technology as an assistance to human interaction. This is a good thing as long as it's not relied on too heavily  to subsitute for personal contact. We continue to amase ourselves with new toys, but someday we might second guess our advancements. "
Tell me about yourself.,"This is my first year at UT and I am not used to doing everything on my own. I am scared that I am not strong enough to make it. I am trying hardest though, I do not want to disappoint my parents. I feel like there is so much to get done and I will not to be able to finish everything on time. I am also worried because I do not understand a lot of what is being taught in my classes. This is extremely frustrating because I took these classes in high school and I did well in all of them. I am confident that I will be able to pull through all of this, and hopefully I will be a stronger person for it. I do like this new environment, however. Austin is a beautiful city. I love being here, and being on my own. I feel like I am discovering so much, and it is great!  I think I have all these different feelings because I am in a new place, with totally different surroundings, and most of all I am on my own. There is no one to depend on but myself. I already see how I am changing and growing. Even though everything seems so overwhelming, I love the experience!     "
Tell me about yourself.,"Jesus Christ, what exactly is this showing me again?  That I can't find anything better else to do than avoid going to work?  Great. Oh well, that's life I suppose. I don't really think I'm a cynic, but you're the psyc here, so after your reading this, please consider that I'm a cynic only for humor, not because I hate the world or anything. You're reading the thoughts of someone who is a huge fan of people like Dennis Leary, now how can you be a fan of Dennis Leary without being a fan of cynicism? Well, what other great questions I'm I to ask during my 20 minutes?  Who the hell knows. I'm listening to one of the few Beatles songs that really just nag at my thought train right now, and I can't change the damn station because I have to keep typing. Isn't this just perfect?  Well, I suppose that too is just part of the assignment. I use to like this song, ""Hello"" I thin is the name of it. ""You say goodbye, I say hello"" I'm sure you know it. It just occurred to e that I'm writing to you, such that this would be a letter, well, I don't think that was supposed to be the way it was intended, you're probably looking for that in my letter you some sort of study, eh?  Well, I guess chalk up one for the ""he wrote this assignment like it was a letter"" category. I do that sometimes I suppose. Just kind of drift off into something not quite exactly like what I'm supposed to be doing. I think it's quite alright, however. I don't see how I'll get anywhere interesting in life doing what only is 'supposed' to be done. So, I suppose. wow, I sure do say 'suppose' a lot in my head. What's that a sign of Mr. Psyc? Maybe one day, I'll be able to pull out a book and write off to people what they seem to fit into according to famous psychologists. Hopefully not though. Hopefully I'll have enough common sense to understand the person, their feelings, and my experiences will guide me to a conclusion on how to help them help themselves without any drugs or unnecessary qualification into a group that some ancient shrink made up. Wow, just in time to look at the clock, looks like I'm almost half way there. I wonder if anyone else in the class types this fast. If not, I bet mine's the longest. I seem to have a somewhat active mind, and since I'm typing fast enough to record a good deal of the thoughts I'm encountering, I should have one of the longer entrees. Not that that is a good or bad I thing, I don't *suppose* Look there, I even had time to put in those neat little asterisks to emphasize that I used the word suppose again. How cute. This thing has to be several hundred words by now. I think I think in short-blocks sometimes. I'm not to sure if that's good or bad. The advantage of short-blocks would be that I'm moving on from one thing to another associated thing pretty quickly, meaning that I'm not stagnating in my thoughts. However, a stagnation in thought can cause a nicer, deeper, if you will, reflection on the topic. Usually this allows me to get to a bit further point in the conversation with myself. I wonder what I'm going to eat for lunch. I'm really not to sure. I've got to go to work. Or at least I should. I could use the extra money. rrGeeze, I could dick those guys around so hard and they'd still ask me to come back. You have to understand that I'm pretty damn good at what I do, and my co-workers and supervisors all realize this. So, when it comes time for me to go back to school, they all say, ""oh well, you're going to at least stay on par time, right, Matt?"" Well, I'd really rather not stay there, I'm quite tired of their inability to do much at all properly. But, money is money, and where else am I going to find someone to pay me part-time hours (15 a week) and get $11. 25/hr for it. I don't have a degree or nothing substantial to demand a higher pay somewhere else. Just knowledge. I suppose if ""Proct"" was some science that not too many people about, then you wouldn't be able to get a degree in ""Proct"" so people would have to hire you simply on how much you knew. Well, that's the way my job is. Granted there are related fields to mine where a degree or a certification can help your resume. But not what I do specifically. So, have you guessed what my field is yet?  I've given several clues. I'm now listening to the Alman Brother's song ""Jessica""  It's a great tune. They just jam along to it, but you can tell a piece of someone's love is in that song. I mean, someone laid a piece of their soul into he music, and when they recorded it, it carried right over into it. The kind of music where you get a chill running down your spine, and then you realize what a good mood you're in. You can have chill-sending songs that are sad, but 'I like the happy ones, they are fewer in number than the sad ones. ""Jessica"" is clearly about a girl, and a girl and a love that made someone very happy. I hope they enjoyed their time together though, because it sounds like the author is just reminiscing. Like it was a summer love or something a bit stronger than that. really like the idea though. Very nice all the way around. A summer love that was beautiful and both enjoyed, but for some 3rd party reason, they had to step aside and let fate take its course, and take them away from each other. It's the definition of looking back on the good times, not the bad. It's not an easy thing to do, you must admit, it takes practice to only see the good parts. But also still keep the bad parts in mind for reference. It's like a library, your memory. In proper shape, it lets you check out the good memories to take and enjoy. But the bad memories are reference only. That way you can't get too bogged down in them. Or at least that's the way I try to keep mine setup. What do you think?  Probably think I'm a silly little kid trying to edge philosophy into an assignment to impress you?  Not really, the thought occurred to me, but how would that help me?  Besides, wouldn't be very honest now would it? Lots of rhetorical questions there, eh?  Well, I've only got a few seconds left. So know that all this is straight out of my mind, and frighteningly enough, it's this active all the time. I may just be sitting somewhere, but I'm thinning away. Surely a Pscy thinks that's good, right. All done. 20 minutes right up there. "
Tell me about yourself.,"so far this freshmen year has been a intereasting adventure if you like S&M. I came down a month early to go with my friends to go to all these fraternity parties and meet a few musicians and audio engineers I have had correspondence with since I recorded my CD. The fraternity parties weren't that great except for a Kappa Sigma one that was pretty wild. I pledged for two days before it hit me that this was a waste of time. Not that waiting in endless lines (with endless hassles) to shell out more money to this fine universtity isn't making me age before my years. I am getting use to the regamorand of rude cafeteria & accounting people and trecking to classes in BFE. I can't say it's all been bad though I did get a free T-shirt and a lot of nefty junk people shove into your hands as you try to walk by. Oh, and then there are the roads with the none existent left turns, constant construction, 30-min limit parking (when you can find it), and cops that stop you for the fun of it. I don't know if its been- oh it gives you more space well then I can continue to ramble. College is supposed to be the best years some say. I think I should of keep better stock in my highschool years. Now except for parties I live like a reclouse in my apartment doing homework for a foriegn language I don't want to learn and trying to write more music while the people above me sound like there having basketball pratice up there. I'm sure it has been atleast twenty minutes by now and if you 've read this far then you're probably ready to quit reading by now. So I'll let you off till I have to write the next one. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm not so sure how I felt about it yet. Not that it was bad or anything, but I'm just not sure how the questions asked could lead to a better understanding of an individual. It seemed to me that questions that were asked only dealt with a couple of issues. Mostly gender, weight, and scared issues. But than again, I guess the experiments that I did this for will probably deal with those issues. I really don't know why I tried to do that survey right when I got up this morning, I just about fell asleep on the keyboard, but that's alright, I finally got through it. after it frizzed up on me 4 times. That was a little frustrating. There is something else that's really bothering me right now also. Nothing to do with school, but socially. I live in California, and hate to say it, but I am a pretty stereotypical Californian kid. I mention this because I have this burning passion for the ocean. Even most people who live in California don't feel as deeply about it as I do. I knew it was going to be hard to leave the ocean when I came to school, but I didn't want to shut myself off from new opportunities and experiences by staying close to the water. Well anyway, I really miss the ocean. Every night I try to picture the crashing waves, and feel the cool mist on an earl morning. When I walk to class I even feel it in my feet and legs. Just on their own my legs begin to surf. The same muscle motions, I guess they call it muscle memory. I can feel myself cutting up the face of a racing wave and slashing the hell out of the lip. Or just grabbing the rail of my board on a meaty left, stalling, and hear the swirl of the water and air in the tube. That's all I live for. or lived for. Texas seems to have stopped my love for a little while. No I take that back, nothing can stop my love for it, I guess Texas just got in the way for a little while. That's where my problem comes up socially. I now realize that if you're not in California, or any beach community for that matter, people just don't understand. I feel like people just view me as some tan kid that dresses a little funny, and claims he does this thing called surfing. Like I said, the perfect stereotype. I guess I wouldn't mind being a poster boy, if kids just knew how I felt. How the ocean just pulls you in, and won't let go. It's a way of life, not just a social activity. It's a culture, and it's become who I am. Not just surfing. I love it but that is only one small facet of why I love the ocean. I just fall asleep every night dreaming of all the good times I've had there. Whether it be piling into one of my friends cars at 600 in the morning for a dawn patrol session without anybody else in the water. Skateboarding down the boardwalk, trying to race the waves as they peel away. Just sitting on the sand with my good friends, talking about anything and everything at the same time. or going there alone, at night to just erase all the thoughts and bad things that happened that day, week, month , or even year. The ocean can do all of that. But people don't seem to realize that. I love Texas, well I don't know if I love Texas. but I definitely love UT, it's just that I have to sacrifice so much more that I realized that I would have to do. I came here and had to leave the biggest, most passionate part of me back home. That's hard for anyone to do regardless of what it might be. It's not that I feel like I'm viewed as an outsider here. more of a novelty, or attraction actually. But I just wish people would have the same opportunities as I did, or have. I want them to fall in love as I did. But that's impossible if you stay in Texas for a lifetime. Come to think of it, I really haven't even talked to many of my friends from back home, I think I'm going to do that today. I've been so focused on making a home for myself here, that I lost sight of the one back in SD. I'm going to make a promise to myself that I will never lose touch of what I left back home, or the people that I left. Just tuck them away as memories, fond memories as I continue to grow, and add to those memories here. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I really miss my home town, but only because I'm not comfortable in my new surroundings. my friends seem short- lived and artificial, and my classes seem all too real and incredibly healthy. I'm constantly worrying that I'll fail and I seem to be hanging out with my thoughts too much, sometimes I feel they are a bad influence on me. I'm only happy when I'm doing something, and people tell me it's because I don't like to deal with my problems. it's true, but at this time I don't care. I have a hard time concentrating, sometimes I wonder if I have ADD. I probably don't , but I like to think I do. they call that a hypochondriac right? I have a question: does  believing you are a hypochondriac mean that you are suffering from something else? I hope so, petty mental problems are better that physical problems. "
Tell me about yourself.,"my mom should be here in about 45 min are we going out to eat or will I have to wait till we get home. who will get the front seat in her car?  I wonder what will be going on in temple when we get back should I go to the football game or hang out with Adam and his friends. it will be our anniversary tomorrow so I should do something with him tomorrow and go to the game tonight. my poor puppy. I really miss him I hope he doesn't shrivel up and die like my mom said sometimes to pets when their owners go away to college. he's been staying under my bed even at dinner. this must be serious. I wonder if Adam and I will stay together. I know that every time a big transition in our lives has occurred, like school starting, things have always been kind of weird. now I guess it's just the same thing. we have a lot of fun one day and then the next thing are weird. I guess that it  is just us adjusting. I can't believe that Lori talked about all of the guys who have stalked her for 25 min this morning in the loudest voice possible. now the whole house knows how desirable she is. this song is annoying but if I get up and change it I won't be able to get back on my writing track. it's over now. she even brought up that guy who threw her in the trash can when she rejected him. she told us that that was back in sixth grade. I guess she is just feeling insecure and needs to tell people that others really do like her. she needs to work on her social skills. I feel sorry for Lindsey. she on the other hand seems to be doing great. I guess she bonded with the other girls during the smoke breaks. it kind of sucks that things that I don't want to do , like smoke or drink keeps me from getting closer to the other girls in the house. after all it is only the second week and I'm sure things will change. I haven't really met that many new people that I want to develop friendships with but strangely I don't even care. I like being by myself more than I used to. I guess that is normal, maybe even a defense mechanism. my mom should be here in half an hour now. I don't even really miss anything about home, except for my dog of course,  probably because I distanced myself from it enough that I was even disgusted with the town in the last week. that helped. I'm glad that I can analyze my own feelings and realize why I'm having them. it helps sort things out and helps me realize that I am having normal reactions to a big transition. I hope that misty is doing alright. I can't believe that Alyson said that about her. she is so inconsiderate and self centered. she wants to hang out on Saturday but I really have no desire to see her. she has become somewhat of a slut in my opinion. twenty minutes is up it was nice talking to you Mr. computer. you should be a therapist "
Tell me about yourself.,"what am I ganna do ? psychology, freshman seminar, all I can do is smoke a cigarette. gosh, am I really ganna get cancer? I hear that every cigarette you smoke takes 5 minutes off your life. my hair is getting long. I wish I could have long hair like Rapunzel. the blonde lady on the wallpaper of my old house. in the guest bathroom. she sat on an elephant. surrounded by trees and shrubbery. god how I used to want to be that lady. I remember as a little girl standing in that bathroom, staring at the wall and at myself in the mirror. where does time go? am I ganna be able to pull off this college business? a computer that is so stubborn. I have no clue how to use computers! I wish I was in all writing classes. I have so much homework. how am I ganna get into the school of communications? do I want to be an english major? gees! 10 hours at the sorority house a week! I wonder if I'll be able to concentrate there. the sound of the paper on my cigarette burning as I inhale. that sketches me out. I need to quit. I need to study. so, there was the door. I got a ticket to the game. what game? I have no clue! football? basketball? I have no clue! I need to get my act together. damn, I'm out of cigerettes. the food downstairs makes me nautious. I wonder if anyone reads this. hello, my name is natalie, my friends call me nat. there are 2 of us. nat berg and nat lep. pronounced ""leap"". both h-town girls. this floor is hard. scratchy, dirty, blue-gray carpet. we had a roach last night. julie is allergic to roaches. that was dad on the phone. sounds kind of pissed. we are going to los angeles for Rosh Hashana. Daniel is there. I can't believe he has mono. that is crazy. he decieded to rush. there is only one jewish fraturnity there. it is so diferent there. beautiful weather. I hate the winter. I hope by then I'll feel better about my classes. I'm so scared. so scared. maybe everyone feels overwhelmed. ut is so huge. how am I supposed to make good grades? I don't even know how to get to class. I'm ganna die. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I don't know how other people (freshmen) are coping with this new transition from high school to college; I feel stress out. Hmm. maybe I'm not so completely at ease like I had claimed earlier. I suppose that I am at ease at this moment is because I don't have any class to go to for hours, and that I think I am at ease right now, is because this is the second week of classes. However, I'm still stress, very much so. (I feel like I'm rambling on and on here. ) I am so very much relief that I have done the pretesting to get one credit hour of the research experiments. I like to try to do things ahead of time so that I won't be in any jams later on. Besides, what with the way my schedule is set, I have to budget my time wisely. Moreover, I am worried that I won't be able to get high grades as I did when I was in high school. Everything in college is so very different and challenging. Sometimes, I feel as if I can't keep up with other people. I admire those people who seems to have everything in control and makes everything so easy to them. I just can't do that. I'm the type that has to put in ""extra work"" so that I can keep up with them. I'm not saying that I'm stupid, gosh no! I believe that everyone is unique in their own little ways. Hmmm. there is one thing, rather, one small minor fear  that I just can't seem to overcome: fear of animals, especially dogs. Well, I took the pretest and in there, it had asked me questions about animal phobia. I really want to know what these fears mean, which brings me to another thought. I always have questions, such questions that are so detailed some people called it ""stupid questions. "" I always find myself having questions about everything. I guess  I'm just a curious person. Hmmmm. I guess this is enough typing for this assignment. I can't think of anything else to write about. Who ever is doing the reading on this writing assignment, I'm sorry it isn't anything that is as exciting as you'll like it to be. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I have not been feelling well, and my throat is bothering me. I am about to go sit in on a freshman seminar class that my cousin took last year and recommended to me. It was full though, so I signed up for another freshamn seminar calss titled ""Introducion to Italian Culture,"" but I dropped it this morning, because I think it is so irrelevant to anything I am interested in, and I am already feeling overwhelmed by my other classes alone. I was signed up to take 15 hours, but since I droppped that seminar, I now have only 12 hours. Anyway, I am going to try and add this other freshman seminar which is ""Interior Design. ""  I'm sure that the professor won't let me in, since it is already full, but I just thought that is worth a shot. I am sitting in my dorm, Hardin House, right now, and I just figured out how to use their computers here. I did not bring my own computer, so I am having to use the computers here. I still do not know how to check my email yet, though. I just figured out how to be able and send email from here. My roommate does have a computer, but I can tell that she would prefer it if I didn't use her's, so I respect that. She has been a pretty good roommate, though, all in all. We knew each other from high school, and we are fairly good friends. I was initially sort of worried about how it would work out, but I think taht it will work out fine. One of my best friends is here, also, but we decided not to room together, because we thought that it might hurt our friendship. She is the one who I am going with to the freshman seminar calss to sit in. She got into that class. Anyway, in the dorm that I am living in, there are two parts across the street from each other. Stacy, the one who is my best friend, lives across the street. The part that I live in is bigger, but I kind of wish that I lived in the other part. The people that I live with seem to be a little bit snobbier or more reserved or something. Oh well, I'm over across the street a lot, so I guess it doesn't really matter all taht much. I am so excited that R. U. F. is starting tonight. It is a bible study that I am going to go to. I've heard that it is so good, and you meet so many neat peoiple there. I miss all of the Christian based things that I went to bakc at home. I used to go to Campus Life, which was really laid back and fun, which was offered through my high school. I also wen tto a smaller bible study once a week which was led by a lady who is now one of my good friends. She is not much older than I am, so she can relate really well to all the stuff that I go through. Not taht I have any major problems or anything, but just all of the normal stuff. Speaking of problems, I did get really homesick the other day. Obviously, I guess you can tell that I am a freshman. Anyway, I got sick , adn any time I am sick I always want my mom there to go get me medicine, and take my temperature, and make me soup, and stuff like that. But, I managed just fine. I went to the health center and saw the doctor, and got a prescription and I am feeling much better today. I still am really tired though. I think that might have been why I got sick in the first place, was lack of sleep. Well, I have finished the twenty minutes, but I'm sure taht this is horribly written, but I guess it doesn;'t matter. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I tried to clam her down before talking to her about what was wrong. When I finally got a complete sentence out of her she told me that a girl who I was friends with, well we weren't like best friends or anything, but I had two classes with her and talked to her everyday, had been killed in a car accident earlier that day. I sat there for a second not even realizing what she was saying. When I got off the phone I went to my mom and told her very matter-of-factly what had happened. The next day I went to school not knowing what to expect, but after having been in class for only a short while and hearing my teachers and principal attempting to explain what happened and try and calm everyone down I was bawling. That's when it hit me, I just didn't understand it. Walking into the classrooms which I had shared with her only the day before was the weirdest feeling, I could see my other classmates in the hall and as they reached the classroom, some screamed, some wept and some just turned and walked away very quickly. The following days were exhausting, I don't think I had every cried that much in my life. I couldn't be at home alone, I don't know what I was afraid of, except just having time to think about it. Despite the hurting that I and the others that knew her felt, I was happy for her. She was in a better place, she was an awesome person and I have no doubt that she is in Heaven now. The funeral was huge it felt like our entire school was there. Her closest friends, including her boyfriend who was driving the car that day, all got up and told funny stories about her and how awesome she really was, that was comforting, but also extremely hard to listen to. At the intersection where she was killed people gathered at all hours of the day and night, it was a very saddening sight to see all of her friends just staring at the cross surrounded by flowers, her favorite candy and pictures, which still stands there. When I went to the cross all I could do was stare at the street and the markings which the police had made only a short time before. After the funeral I only went to her grave once and that was after attending my neighbors funeral, they were buried practically next to each other. It was all I could do to keep my attention on the service. When the time had finally come for my to walk over to her spot, I was fine until I faced it directly and saw her picture laying among the flowers and notes everyone had left. I lost it, I almost fell, but my sister caught me. I was a mess. I wrote her countless letters that never made it to the cross or to the site, but I know she knows how I feel and that comforts me. I pray for her family and close friends all the time, it was hard enough for me I can't imagine what it was like for them. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I feel a bit stressed due to the fact that my first three tests are all next week. What will they be like?  Will I do well?  Or, will I enter the large classroom, with a crowd of students all cramming in the information for those last final moments before the test and freeze after spending countless hours preparing. The new environment is wonderful, however many changes come along with it. The first test of the year, the first test at college. Each exam seems to have much more bearing upon your grades than in the past. Some thoughts about how I'm going to go about studying have crossed my mind over the past few days. These hours have most likely been wasted, as I could have been studying or reading material which will be covered on my tests. However, this is not quite the way I always function. I often tend to spend too much time worrying about how I will go about doing something, rather than just doing it. Anyway, I spent a couple of hours studying today and I have figured out what time of each of my days between now and Wednesday, and how each precious moment will be spent. I'm sure it will all work out, but until these first three tests are finished, I know that some time will be spent worrying about how the final result turn out. Those are just some thoughts about school which are probably quite typical of a freshman. It's strange to come from the top, back down to a little freshman. It appears that quite a few people have decreased their level of maturity back down to a freshman in high school. A girl I know walked back into her room last night to find her pictures colored on and holes punched in her eyes. Seems a bit disturbing, doesn't it?  There's always the issue of talking to a boy and everyone assuming that your ""going steady. ""  It's difficult to even go to someone's room of the opposite sex without everyone assuming that you must have been doing something rather than talking. I guess everything, with time will pass. I'm really enjoying the transition, for the most part. It's strange to not see some of my best friends, but this is all part of growing up (Not to sound hokey). So far, it's been lots of fun and a time of many changes. I'm eager to see what lies in the future and continue to make new friends.   "
Tell me about yourself.,"Okay the way my mind works. Well at the present moment many things are running through my head. Everyday I think of the same things over and over again until I get them resolved. My mind worries a lot. Right now I hope that I get all of my assignments done including this one, and that I do them well. My main concern right now is doing well in all of my classes. I'm so scared that I am not going to do well here and that I am going to have to drop out and go back home. Then I won't get as good as an education that I hoped for, which will inturn will prevent me from getting into any good law school. Then I won't get a good job, so I can't support myself much less a family, and I wind up a bum for the rest of my life. It's amazing how the littlest things have the biggest affect on something. Actuallly, I was just thinking, I hope that my parents will even have the money to pay for my education. If I can't do that than I don't even have to worry about any of this, because I won't be going here at all. I miss my family. For eighteen years I have never been apart from any member of my immediate family. I don't know how I have survived the last two weeks without them. I miss my Mother especially. Yesterday, I left home again because I went back for the weekend, and I felt as if I were leaving for the first time. The same feelings overcame as  they did when I first left her. I wanted to cry. I want to cry now just talking about all of this, but I won't. I tend to do that a lot. Hide my emotions. I guess I just figure that by hiding them, I am not as vulnerable to other people as I would be if I were to actually show them. I just realized how incredibly slow I am at typing because twenty minutes have just passed since I began this writting assignment. So on that note I will end my writting entry. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Why do I always analyze things to the point that I completely stress myself out about it?  I find myself doing this time and time again.   I feel stupid, I can't believe that I let Jaime set me up on a date with someone that I don't even know. To top that, I barely know her. What was I thinking? The way that she is talking, he is the most gorgeous guy she's ever seen; however, I am really scared that I am going to be really let down. I know that sounds really negative, but I guess it sounds too good to be true. It doesn't make sense to me how this whole thing works anyways. Your sorority tells you about a party that they are having, giving you only two days notice to find a date. To me that is completely weird. I just don't have the guts to go up to some random guy and ask him to go to something that I'm not even sure will be fun myself. Oh well, it will all work out.   Now, on the other hand, I'm all about going to the pledge line tomorrow. I couldn't believe that someone asked me. It made me feel so good inside to know that I was one of the few girls to get asked!    I don't know what my problem is; it just seems like I can't stop thinking about how much weight I think that I need to lose. It seems to be the only thing that I think about any more, and I don't know why. I don't think that there is anything wrong with me, but then again, maybe there is . You never can tell any more.   All I know is that there are so many things going on and not enough time. I wish that my body wouldn't go through such big ""swings"". One minute I am bursting with energy, and the next I can't even keep my eyes open. It is as if a person is holding onto my heels and making me drag them for hours on end. After dragging them for so long, you just can't drag any more. This tiredness that sweeps over me comes frequently throughout the day, but , without fail, it comes each day between 2pm and 5pm. I want to be like others that are comstantly energetic, skinny, and seem to get everthing done with no problems at all. I guess that is only a perception in my mind that only sees things from the outside instead of how they really are. Does that make sense?     Why can't there be more hours in the day. I feel like ever since I have gotten here, all the time in my day has flown by, and comtinues to fly by without even slowing down. Which is fine with me as long as I don't leace things that are really important to me out. Unfortunately, this is what I have been forced to do because I my new schedule.    Before I came to school, I worked out daily so that I could relieve all of my stess, and feel good all at the same time. Now I can't even find time to get to class--much less work out.   I wonder how Nolan is. Is such a sweet little boy. Ever since he was born I have loved those kids, and had a compassion for them that no one else could ever have.    I can't believe that Catrina came up to me and asked me about Ryan Murphy the other day. I mean talk about digging up painful things that have already been buried!! Whenever she said something, every bit of hurt and anger inside of me came back like it was just yesterday that it had happened.   I need to put it past, and forgive and forget. That is at least what I know I am supposed to do, but it is so hard! Why do I get attached to people so easily? That is one thing even I will never know. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I got back yesterdayform Miami , from my cousins wedding. it was agreat. we parited so hard I think I have to fo into detox for a while. it sucks because now I'm back at school and its time to study and get the grades. mami and pai keep telling me I  have to do good but as if I ddnt lknow that already. they think that I'm some kind of schmuck who doent know what he is doing. i  mean I'm nineteen years old , I'm in college they would at least trust me a little b\it to do good. its actuallty funny the fact that they worry more about the way I'm keeping my room than my grades. i like her.

Tell me about yourself.,"Right now, I am very busy. I am very preoccupied by trying to balance my academic studies with my social life. Joining a fraternity is a very difficult thing to do, as it entails choosing a group of people who are most like you, in that they share common ideals and interests. Outside of my world at the University of Texas, I am also struglling to maintain a long distance relationship with the woman who could possibly grow to become my wife. She attends the University of Alabama, and she is also an incoming freshman. However, my troubles are very different than hers. Yes, she joined a serority, but the Greek process that involves women is wholly differnt than the one concerning men. But what is important is that she has already become an active member of a serority, a serority in which she already grown a liking to many active members. I, on the other hand, have just begun my process of joining a fraternity, and is not only stressful but very intimidating. In my opinion, older men are simply more imtimidating and less likely to accept new members than older women. This process of distancing ourselves from each other and the process pf maing new friends, indpendenet of one another, has taken its toll on the quality of our relationship. We often argue, our telephone conversations are usually brief and superficial, and we lack a common ground on which to converse. I am worried than our relationship will not withstand the tests of time and distance, which is the most bothersome thing of all. My feelings for her are still intense, yet they no longer stand forefront in my mind. Now, I have other academic as well as social predicaments to fill uo my time. I worry that she is experiencing the same phenomenon. In addition, I am thinking of how alone I feel in this problem. My roomate does share a similar experience, and I can subsequently not look to him for guidance or advice. I don't want my feelings tp change towards Christel, but I fear that they will, and we will eventually encounter a mutual break-up, but one after which we cannot remain friends. Digressing on a tangent, I can stare out my window as I type this essay, a look out onto the hiils of Austin. Coming from Dallas, I have grown to appreciate Austin's attractive landscape. It hills, its sunsets, and other natural phenomenons sometimes offer a sense of peace during such a hectic time. My roomate is always creating some kind of noise. As I sit here and try to complete this assignment, he is playing a game of football on the Sony Playstation. Does he not have homework to do?  I don't know, I guess that it bothers me sometimes that I feel and seem so busy when those around me seem carefree and happy. Will I ever feel completely happy again? In the near future?  It's not that I'm depressed or willing to let go of Christel to free myself of these ""troubles,"" it's just that I want all the things that trouble me to merge into one moment of happiness, during whcih all things just ""click together. ""  Too optimistic, I know. That'slife, I know, but I can still wish that things could be different. I never tyhought I'd say this, butit feels good to attack this assignment. In a sense, it's profoundly fulfilling to articulate your troubles as you feel them. I guess sometimes it's easier to realize the way you feel when you struggle to put it into words. But, I've still got troubles. God, I sound depressed, but the fact of the matter is that I am actually having a pretty good time. I have made friends, and I relaize that, given time, all of my problems will work themselves out. I truly believe that unhappiness is a temporary sentiment, as happiness is the underlying emotion in every situation. Damn, I've got to wake up early tomorrow. I wish it was like that, but, as most people would say, that's life!  My twenty minutes is almost up, and I really feel better for having articulated some of unshared and unresoved conflicts.  "
Tell me about yourself.,"bored.

Tell me about yourself.,"The reality that college isn't just one continuous party is finally beginning to set in now that I have chpaters of information to read in all of my classes. I think somewhere in my mind I thought that college would be easier and less stressful than high school because it seems like there'e more free time. Well, I know now that this will not be so. All my free hours during the week will be full of reading, studying, writing, reading, studying, writing. I'm really afraid that I won't know what to expect on examinations. I've spent about an hour reading twenty pages out of my psychology book and can't imagine what I'm going to do. Reading and reading gets so boring, except when the material is very interesting. I also started reading my Economics, and enjoyed reading the parts that I recognized as being covered in class. I've discovered that going out every night and staying out until 2:00 a. m. is not going to cut it. The first week of school I tried this and could hardly stay awake during class. There are lots of pressures both externally and internally to go out and ""party"" and meet people every night. Externally, I'm a member of a sorority and we're supposed to party a lot with our sorority sisters. Internally, I feel like I'm missing out or something if I don't go. Maybe there's a cute guy out there just waiting for me to meet him, yeah right. I ran into this guy randomly on the street outside of UTC that I had met at Orientation. We recognized eachother and talked for a minute. A couple days later I saw him in my EConomics class. It would be so cool if some how we were to start talking or something. But, great things like that usually don't happen to me. My roommate and friend across the hall both make fun of me for having such a crush on this guy. I really like them a lot. We all got so lucky with the girls staying in our hall. Everyone is so nice and we get along well. I especially like my roommate. We have the same interests, likes, and dislikes. We aren't in the same sorority which kind of makes me sad, but we still do stuff together. Last night we stayed in and worked on our psych pretesting which took me like two hours after the UT football game. We were pretty bummed that they lost. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Tomorrow I'm going to go back to my hometown of Grapevine, Texas, where I get the chance to revisit some of my old high school friends that are still in high school, and some friends that have graduated as well, that will be home as well. I guess I'm looking forward to the weekend, however I realize that I am still missing a lot of the social activities that are going on at UT. Currently my roommate is pondering why I listen to so much music all the time. To tell you the truth, I really don't know why I do. One of the reasons may be that I grew up surrounded by music, my brother being a person that played a lot of it around the house, as well as the fact that a lof of my friends also listen to music a whole lot. I just saw the MTV music awards, which was ok. I mean it started out cool and such. with three great bands on stage at once, however it kinda declined from there into some trendy mush of junk. Some bands these days I can hardly consider a ""band"" in the least sense of the word. I just remembered that I missed my SI meeting tonight. that which I am not too happy about, but I shall make an even harder attempt to make the next one. Sometimes I wonder why people don't like dorm life that much. I mean its a nice social place where you get to meet people, and sometimes the rooms arent THAT bad. not even in jester, which is supposedly the biggest dorm in the nation or something to that effect. I've been to other places and apartments, and I think I still like mine the best. or maybe its just my way of rationalizing to myself the living conditions that I recieved. I hope my ride back home tomorrow is expedient. I get so darn tired after car rides. you wouldnt think so after sitting down for three or more hours, but you always are. maybe its because the body expects you to be sleeping or something. who knows. I'm also doing laundry at the same time. really different than the laundry back home, seeing as how the dryers take the whole freaking day to dry your clothes. geez, I'll be up for a while. Sometimes I wonder why people can be such jerks to others, especially in relationships. In this summer alone, 4 of my close friends experienced breakups in relationships, either due to faults of their own, or others. 2 of them cheated on the other, which is something that is really bad. I guess the human mind likes to think that when you commit to someone else, you expect the same in return, no matter if you are drunk, stupid, wasted, etc. It's prolly also the lowest of things that one can do to another in a relationship as well. Luckily I was not immediately affected by any of the aforementioned incidents. I never really know what to say to people that get the sharp end of the stick in those situations either. I mean what can you say?? I'm sorry?  you'll do better next time?? hardly. It feels like I'm typing into a diary or something. which I don't keep. I really want to go see some live bands here in austin. I mean it IS supposedly the Live Music Capital of the world. or nation. whichever. its supposed to have something more than just 6th street. at least things in austin aren't that bad. my roommate's pretty cool, better than someone else I could've ended up with. the food. could be better. but its not too bad. Overall university life is pretty ok. a lot of people here are nice and friendly. barton springs is really really REALLY cold. man is it cold. I wish I had something to eat as of right now. I'm kinda hungry. at least the jester express is still open for a while. Some of my friends are wanting to go the jester late night express right now. which is a really good idea. good thing the time thingy is almost over. hopefully my laundry will almost be done as well. I hate doing laundry. I especially hate ironing. but I guess they're something that I'm just going to have to live with for the rest of my lfie. carpe diem. seize the day. dead poets society. a great movie. seizing the day however. I think at least. should only be done in short bursts, and not always. It just seems like looking at the short term benefits or consequences and never at the long term just seems kinda idiotic. right?  Some people I know take it way to the extreme. I wouldnt even know how to write it down. so now I'm wondering who's going to read this paper, and what they're going to think. or if anyone is going to even read it at all? pennebaker? the asian guy? that michelle girl?  who knows. that video that was showed last class was pretty weird. that guy/girl strapped to the machine. and all those brian waves. I guess it wasnt ""weird. "" just something that we don't see that often. it was pretty cool I guess. now I also know how to escape a lie detector test if there was ever a chance that I would be detained by the FBI for some criminal knowledge that I may possess for some odd reason. who knows. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I just got of the phone with my best friend Lauren from home (Potomac, Md) and it was weird because she hasn't left for school yet - she is going to the University of Pennsylvania - so When I talk to her we are coming from such different perspectives right now and it is really strange since we have always been so similar in everything before. We were talking about our other good friend Meryl who is going to Cornell and has been there for about the same amount of time that I have been here and she was saying how she has been talking to her everyday but that Meryl is so happy and has so many friends and even a new boyfriend and I was saying how that is really weird and annoying because I honestly am pretty happy and having what I think is a fairly normal adjustment to college but I don't have like a real group of friends yet or anything and it isn't everything that I had hoped college would be yet, but I figure that I have only been here for two weeks. Lauren was saying that what she thinks is so weird about it though is that Meryl says that she goes out everynight and loves school and everything but she calls her everyday and I say that I am still adjusting etc and I don't even have time to talk to her everyday. I don't know, I just think that it is really annoying and try not to talk to Meryl too much because it makes me feel like there is something wrong with me since things aren't going quite as well for me and it makes me feel sort of bitter towards her. Tonight I went out to dinner with my friend Katie who I met when I went on Camp Texas and I love. We went to the Hula Hut and it was really good because I had really been away from Campus and the whole UT thing since I got here and I was sort of starting to feel like  I was stuck in a bubble and out of touch with reality so it was good to get away for a little bit. Plus, the food was really good and I hadn't had a real good meal since I got here either. It also made me more sure that I had made the right decision about going home for a the weekend of Sept. 17-20 (for the jewish holiday) because I saw that it was good to be in car and get away and realized that it would definately be good for me to get away for a longer period of time. Before I went to dinner tonight I was worried that I wouldn't want to go because I would feel like I was missing things here but now I see that I definately did make the right decision. Also when I go home I am going to drive up to Penn for the night to see Lauren and when I was talking to her it sounded like she was really excited to see me so that is good too. I feel like I should be really stressed right now about schoolwork and everything with this being my first semester of college and my first time at a big, public school since I attended a small private high school but I honestly feel like I have less work then I did in high school and that it is easier - plus I am really staying on top of it. The only concern that I am having at all is the size of my classes (all of them have over 200 people in them) because I am used to being in classes with about 15 people in them and recieving a lot of focused attention from my teachers and although I am not concerned about this affecting my performance as I feel that I am completely capable on my own, I am worried I will be overlooked and just be a number in crowd - which I'm sure that I will be in a lot of my classes, at least for a while. So far though I like my classes at least and find them interesting and all of my professors do seem to be pretty interesting and approachable. I also rushed and am pledging a sorority which, even though I really like it and am happy that I did it is becoming more and more time consuming and I getting worried that I am going to have trouble completing everything that I need to do for that but I am sure that it will not be as tough as I am expecting. Right now I am listening to a really good CD that Lauren sent me that our friend Dave made for me and it is so good because it is a mix that he made of all of these really good old songs plus a couple of good new ones. I have three minutes left to write now and I am really running out of things to say except that earlier I found a cricket or grasshopper or something in my room and it is really gross and I don't know how it got up here because I like on the 11th floor of dobie and there are no windows but it is totally gross and I am definately going to file a complaint and tell the front desk that I need an exterminator or something. Well I think that my time is up now so bye. "
Tell me about yourself.,"so here I am trying to figure out what it is that I am thinking. maybe I shouldn't have given advice to genevieve about her mother. I don't  really know the situation and even more than that the little that I do know. I have never experienced. adrian too. he must really be having a difficult time dealing with the death of his mother. man, my finger really hurts. the manicurist was trying to drill my cuticles off. but they're pretty. I don't know what I should do with the whole beta thing. they are all nice, but I am tired of being pressured into situations that I am not comfortable. maybe I set myself up for it. right now I am a little emabrassed because I am really hungry and these 20 minutes are not passing quick enough. I know the instructions say not to worry about grammer and spelling, but it's really hard to read my own writing and have all these misspelled words pop up. nose itches. I wonder if I will be able to handle rush and my classes. as it is I am already blowing off my other classes for organic. even more than that, I hope I get my financial \aid in on time. I really do feel bad about making my father feel like he wasn;t there for me. my mom says that it'll work itself out but this whole financial crap really is upsetting. I know of families that have been torn apart beacuse of that. all I know is that they'll have my ass until I am like 40. which really sucks. an education shouldn't be so expensive that once you get one and start a job you are so in the hole that you're broke all the time. maybe I should drop out and og to massage therapy school like I wanted to a long time ago. I can't believe  that I haven't heard from dannee. I am really upset about what our friendship has become. sometimes I even think of andy and I don;t know why. he's probably happily married with a kid. (I am really glad that it's not my kid, though. cause then I'd really be screwed with the whole moiney thing) 5 more minutes. I can't believe how little I have written. I must be the slowest typer. there's my stomach again. at least I don't have any classes today. that way I can print up my organic and biology and go home to eat. even when I get there I don't know how to react with genevieve. she complains about her mother and then does the exact thing that she complains about. I bet I do the same thing. wow that guy is really talking very loud. I wonder why (2 minutes) people walk aroiund libraries talking so loud. how inconsiderate. I even had a wierd dream last night. but I think if I were to think about it now my finers would not be able  to type quick enough to write it in the last couple of minutes. I wonder who called us this morning at like 7:30. good thing I was able to fall back to sleep. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am feeling rather comfortable right now, much more comfortable than in the previous days. I don't know if I made the right decisin in coming here, I guess that's because people keep on asking me where I an from and when I say Hawaii they all ask me why I transfered and why I came here, as if Hawaii is so amazing and this place sucks. I guess Hawaii is pretty amazing in some ways. But it's not like my life was particularly great or exciting there. Added to that I don't like knowing everyone, well I like knowing people but I don't like it when you have no aninimity. I also am thinking a lot about girls, girls and sex, sex and girls, I guess that goes without saying. I feel like I have to step up my game and almost go out ""hunting"" for them, but thats kind of weird to have that kind of attitude. It's not terrible romantic, but I'm getting pretty desperate. There are some hot hot girls here. I don't know what's my problem, It's probably because I live in Simkins which is on the other end of the earth. That's probably also just an excuse, because no matter where you are you still have to put some effort forward to meet women. Although it is a lot easier when your living with them. It's not so bad I've meet some women here, but the one that I am more serious with, I don't find myself attracted to at all. She's got a great personality, and she's female, which is a definite plus, but I really can't see myself commiting to her or having anything really serious. It's probably a partial ego problem,because of her relative homeliness. But I really do like to be surrounded by beauty, yeah right why did you move away from Hawaii. No I really like to beautiful things and have a real eye for asthetics. I need to be with a really attractive woman, fat chance of that happening with this face, and this nose, and no hair cut, and this voice and this low self-esteem. But I really want to go out with Nicole, she is a goddess on earth, she is so sweet and gentle and gorgeous. I can't belive it, and I act like such a dork around her but she doesn't seem to mind, and that's what I loooooovvvvveeeee about her she is so hot, I must do eveything in my power to win her I must put the wheels in motion before she gets snatched up, because I know that if I don't act soon and I mean like in the next five minutes, some other guy with more guts and better looks is going to see what I see and I cannnot let that happen not this time, I've let that happen too many times in the past I've let every girl that I've ever had feelings for get away. And Nicole may be the one, she's in the fricking Pharmacy school she could take care of me the looser that I am, but if I were with her I would not let that happen. I would do everything for her, I would work night and day and fight my way to the top to provide for her. I have my mission, I must develop my plan, and somewhere in between I must get some studying done. Straight A's and Nicole that will be the story of my life for this year. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am glad that I am finally getting to this assignment!  I have had so much homework, and just can't seem to stay on top of things. ""I'll have the weekend,"" I continue to say to myself, but I know I'll just want to watch television or hang out instead. I went to the meeting of the tennis club today, and am very excited about that, even if I have to ride the bus to the courts whenever I want to play. I went running this morning, but just feel so out of shape. I know I'll never be super skinny, my body just isn't built like that!  I'm looking forward to playing again. I'm even willing to brave the tournaments, or at least look cool wearing a new t-shirt showing off my participation. I'm sill hoping to meet some people who I can actually hang out with, go out with, stuff like that. I meet many people, but none of them seem to be willing to get to know the real you. They all have friends here from school, yeah, like anyone else from Wyoming is crazy enough to come here. I also want to play the piano some while I am here. I don't have my books, so I'll have to recover them when I go home in October. I am excited about that, it will be so neat to ""fly home"" for the weekend!  Hopefully I'll make it up to Cheyenne and Laramie to see some people. I've been thinking a lot about Holly lately, and would love to be able to connect with her through seeing Den'ja and preserving her memory. Too bad he is never home when I call. While I am doing this, I realize I need to do the pre-test, I just can't seem to find an hour!  The weeks are already flying by, and the panic of upcoming tests is setting in. ""Oh no, only a week and a half until the first Psych test!""  I'm caught up in reading, re-typing notes, now all I need to do is read them over. I'm so tired right now, all that is left on the agenda for tonight is German, and reading Chapter 5 of Astronomy. It will be nice to actually do problems for once, instead of living my life reading and taking notes. I can't wait until I am confindent in my self-image, if that ever occurs. I just don't have the will power to work out like a crazy woman!  Tennis. just keep thinking. tennis. I really do love tennis, and its number one male star Pete Sampras. Too bad he is injured, the US Open just isn't the same!  Maybe my new tennis partners will become my new buddies!  Speaking of tennis, another thing to add to my list is to check on Match Mates. Wow, twenty minutes can be a long time when the assignment is to ramble on about yourself. Sophia has to go to the mall this weekend, so I'm going to go with her. RUE 21 and Forever 21, I need to buy myself a new outfit. It will be quite the experience catching the bus to get there though. Just like making it to the tennis courts, I'm a pro at the campus look today. I hope the woman who feel outside Jester is ok, that would be so scary!  I need to go to bed, and tomorrow is my super long day. The SI sessions are going to be a big help, but they are just such a pain to attend. An extra three hours a day is enough to make me crazy. Freshman Leadership Organization meets tomorrow, so that will be fun. Also, Party on the Plaza is tomorrow night, a fun function. I hope I didn't miss Austin Powers playing on the south mall. I didn't get very much e-mail today, that makes for a depressing day. I did, however, get my high school yearbook. I loved how I pimped that school, I miss the friendships. I miss tennis season. Most college students say they don't want to go back to high school, but at this point I wouldn't mind. I'd have to say I loved not doing homework. Ooh, our sing just sounded like it was about to die. I love the internet, it is so convienient typing this paper to submit via the information super highway!  I am completely addicted to my computer, and I'd die without it. I type everything, e-mail everyone, it is truly my life! Well, my 20 minutes are up. "
Tell me about yourself.,"When asked to write about my subconcious it just blocked everything that was in my mind. Let me see. well today I went to this Sigma Phi Omega Rush event and that has been in my mind ever since. Everyone there was so nice, everyone was smiling and introducing themselves and it makes me wonder is that how they really are? Or are they just doing that to get us to like their organization so they can take our money? Maybe I'm being paranoid, but those people were just really very very friendly that it felt like some horror flick full og nice smiling faces and they wait for the right moment to attack. During this event they had us fill out a questionare kind of like an application. One of the question was ""What quality do you have to contribute to the organization?""  The thing was I couldn't think of anything to say. I mean I am not a talented singer or anything or a pianist. I am just me. Isn't that enough? Then later on they interviewes us and they taped us! How embarrasing! They asked questions that will catch you by surprise! Like ""What song best describes you?"" I was like ummmmmmmmmmm OH OH the first thing that popped in my mind was Butterfly by Mariah Carey. I just made up some bogus answer that it symbolizes freedom and independency. honestly though I had no idea at the time what Butterfly was about or was talking about. I wonder if they know!? Oh well. I've been debating with my friends if I should join or not because it seems like a great experience meeting new people and all. The only thing that I am worried about is will they accept me for who I am or do I have to be the typical sorority chic? and I forgot to mention. Pledging is the big secret it is supposed to last 8 weeks! and no one can mention what exactly goes on during this 8 weeks!  DO we have to clean toilets or what? Maybe that is why they keep it a secret because once all the Rushees know about it they will think again before they join. Makes me wonder what pledging is all about. A lot of people think that joining a sorority is a good idea especially for social reasons. I would describe myself as friendly and sometimes outgoing, but I can be pretty shy with strangers. is that weird? It's just that some people I meet is just that I have no idea what to talk about, it is as if I freeze and don't know what to say. It is also kind of embarrasing because you look like a total fool if you don't know what to say or do especially with someone who doesn't know you very well. I think the reason why I sometimes feel that way, is that I feel intimidated and I feel really awkward. Like I do right now because I feel like I am runing out of things to say. Actually to think about it sororities do take up much time. Just to go to Rush events I have spent approximately 8 hours already and I haven't even been in it yet. It was for two organizations. Tomorrow is the party and I am not really looking forward to it because deep down inside I want to stay in my dorm and study instead of going to the Club. Lately I have been lazy and haven't been doing much but I promise myself that I will study and get the grades my parents deserve to see after all they've done for me. And if they ever find out I went to these meetings instead of study they won't be so proud. But I think one of the reasons that parents don't understand these tings, is because all they want me to do is study. I guess going and Rushing for these sororities is kind of my way to rebel. I know it sounds weird, but that is how I feel. "
Tell me about yourself.,"At this moment I,m really thinking about what I'll be thinking about to make this assignment interesting and if my twenty minutes of thought will be worth reading. I missed dinner again, so my stomach is on my mind. I'm munching as I do this assignment, but I don't think you are suppose to have food around the computer but I don;t know why. What is it with these computers anyway, I've been screwing with mine for three weeks and I can't figure it all out. I hate to ask for help and admit defeat by technology. No where can I find my freaking e-mail to check it. I don't even know if I really have an address because I registereds for it over the computer and don't know if it worked. I figured out why food and computers don't mix. My fingers are starting to stick to the keys. but caramel popcorn is good, better than the food in the dining halls anyway. I like this assignment- I/m getting to vent all of my frustrations and the millions of little thoughts that buzz around in my head all day. I knew tyhat writing is good therapy, but this is already making me feel better too. Now maybe I'll set up my journal on the web and make people pay to read like they pay to watch people going about their daily lives. It must be weird having cameras everywhere like on those shows but I would probably have fun because I'm a camera hog anyway. I should have paid more attention in typing class. I know I'm not using the right ""home keys"" and my fingers are still sticking everywhere. I hope I don''t have a lot more stuff to do tonight because I'm ready to go to sleep, even though it's barely eight. I feel like calling some of my friends from back home, but I doubt that they are home and studying like I am. My Mom didn't call back from work. She may not have even got the message thyat I called. Mail takes way too long to get here from Dallas. I thought it would be a day or two from there to here, but it's more like five or so. Today's THE eighth and I just now got stuff from tyhe second. Tomorrow is Jenna's birthday. I guess I'll call and sing and act like the goofy big sister. If I was her age zi don''t know if I would want a big sister. I guess it might be neat. I hope my roommate doesn't stay up all night again. I don't know what she does withall herw time. She always studies but she never gets anything done. I don't do much of anything, but I always getstuff done. I guess it's time management skills. I sleep too much. I think my twenty minutes are up, or past where's the submit button?  "
Tell me about yourself.,"ok, so my grandfather died yesterday. why don't I feel sad yet. what is wrong with me, do I have no conscionce?  When my mother told my sister and I, she told us like we should pitty her, not like we should also be sad, what the f*** he was my grandfather. it was all about her, when can you come down to houston to watch the animals, so I can go to the funeral, not, do you wnat to come with me to the funeral?  how can she possible be so selfish. but then look at me, I am so busy being angry, I haven't had a chance to be sad yet. what if I don't get sad?  Is that bad?  Am I a bad person?  I only saw him once every couple of years, if that. I didn't really know him,  and when I did see him he was very generous, but also a real jerk. his intensions were always really good, but he always was very bosy and rude. I remember once when I was like 8 we went out to eat, and he yelled at the waitress because they didn't seat us fast enough. but, last year when he came to my graduation we went out to eat . oh had a thought. My sister and I were thinking about him the night before he died. thinking about how he is always so concerned with us, like for example, he always focused in on something important to us, like when I was a vegitarian he always sent we cook books and when I danced he always called me his little princess or his little ballerina. this continued for years, he never forgot. . when we went out to eat for my graduation he was so polite to the waiter, and even joked with him "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, my mother has just gone back to India ten minutes back, and frankly I am not all too sad about that, or not as yet atleast. All these days there were a lot of things I could not join in because I felt obliged to spend time with her and honestly I enjoyed myself. What made me most uncomfortable was the thought of what others would think. Would I be able to be a part of a group?    I have never really been one to mingle in a crowd. I suffer from what I call the "" wall paper syndrome"". I feel like the audience to a television program where everyone is settled in their roles. I might have just been flung inside and there I am trying to fit in, wanting to fit in but getting so so intimidated!   Everyone here seems so confident of what they are doing and saying and whats worse is that they are probably doing the right things, though who decides what is RIGHT and WRONG I am yet to discover. I come from a different culture and background. I have always excelled in academics but here I find myself doubting my ability. Will I be able to cope with the new system? Will I ever belong?   There seems to be a yearning to be accepted and appreciated, that I am terrified that revealing my true self, which I am not too sure about, might mess up all my chances. Every one seems to be better than me, be it in terms of making friends, getting adjusted or simply being themselves. I feel that every second person is laughing at me. I feel so lonely inn this huge university. This is the worse feeling to have, feeling alone in a crowd!   They say that everyone feels the same way in the beginning. But do I believe that? Obviously not! Here I sit in RLM writing frantically about my nervous self and everyone around me is reading either their reference books or a newspaper, no matter what they do, they seem to be at peace with themselves. that is what I am hoping that sooner ar later (sooner if it were up to me) I will achieve. I came here to let my self lose. To undo the shackles that had bound me to a not too pleasant past when it came to self esteem. I want to be able to do that. I want to be able to be the person that lives in my dreams. Again am I trying to be someone that I am not? I know that it is not in me to go up to a stranger and start of a conversation. I stop after "" Austin is so hot""! Is it wrong? Does that make me in any way lesser than the rest? Rationally speaking obviously not. that is the kind of person I am. But everyone I seem to come across is so extroverted. I know that there is no such thing as right person or wrong person but feeling seem to surpass reason at this point. is it because I grew up with asister who was always popular because of her looks and her gift of the gab. Who had all the night life I never had, and said I never wanted. Is it because of the mother I had. Always the center of attention because of her looks and her brilliance, because of her great achievements and ideals. I don't think it fair to push the buck on to someone else. I must learn to take responsibility for myself.  It is so strange. I always wanted to come down here. It was the perfect picture. I was going to start afresh. This was going to be the birth of a new self. What happened? Am I giving up all too soon? Am I alone in feeling this way? Will this small fish find her way in the large ocean? Will someone notice the wallpaper? Will I be able to come out of this a surer person? WILL I BE ABLE TO FIND MYSELF, FOR BETTER OR FOR FOR WORSE, IN THIS CONTINUOUS FIGHT TO FIND MY PLACE IN THIS PUZZLE. (that is assuming that I have a place!) "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now I feel really happy and anxious because my family is coming to visit me. I miss them so much. This morning I felt different because they called me last night to tell me that they were not going to be able to come. This morning they called me to tell me they were anyways. Now I feel much better. I even felt like eating. There are mornings when I don't have an apetite. I have been thinking about college lately. I like it here but there are sometimes when I feel lonely. I wish I was with my family. But, I guess I have to learn to be by myself so I can know myself better. Lately I have been thinking about transfering to UTA. But I fear that my classes won't transfer. I really have to think about this one really carefull. Right now I also feel a little worried because I have so much homework to do. I don't even know where to start. Right now I feel like talking to my friends from high school but I don't have their phone numbers or their emails. I wish I could talk to a few of them, to see how they are doing and what their plans are for the future. I never thought that this assignment will be so easy. The thing that I most hate is this kind of assigment because I run out of things to say (like right now). Oh, today is my mom's birthday. This was one of the things I was sad about, yesterday. This would have been the first time I would have been away from home on her birthday. I really would like the 20 minutes to be over right now because I have a lot of stuff to do. The past two weeks I have notice how important TV is for me. I have to plan all of my life around TV. I can wait untill tonight when I get to watch my favorite program. I wish I could be someone famous right now. I don't care if is a model, actress, dancer or whatever but I would like to be famous. I also would like to live in Miami. This summer was the first time I ever visited Miami and loved it with all my heart. Hope one day I will move there and be like all the people from there. They all look like models, beautiful and well dressed. They all have incredible cars and clubs and restaurants. I can't wait untill November when I go to Ricky Martin's concert, its going to be incredeble. "
Tell me about yourself.,"okay, this is an interesting assignment. what to write about, there is not much to say. I want to go back home because I am not having to much fun here. I miss my friends and want to sleep in my own bed. keeping in touch takes up a lot of time. oh well asdfjkl;asdfjkl;jjjkl;asdfjum, alreight this is wierd. what am I going to talk about for twenty minutes. ?  well, the food here is really getting discusting, the other day I could have sworn there was a finger in the hotdogs. it made me want to puke, man only three minutes have passed. hmmmmmmmmm. I want ot go home. I just got back yesterday also. I only like the freedom here, it sucks not having a car. I went home and it felt really weird to drive. my rroommate is kind of getting on my nerves, she hasnt done anything but she is just getting on my nerves. she never cleans up and is always on the stupid computer. it just gets on my nerves. like today, she threw away a milk carton in the trash, well if I hadnt have taken the trash down the hall it would have started to smell. also, I'm the only one who brought any functional things. I brought the tv, vcr, answering machine, stereo, vacuum, curtains, rug, etc. she just brought a bunch of junk to clutter everything up and put on my tv. I guess I should stop complaining, but it is really starting to bother me. I might start sounding selfish also, but she doesn't share much and I of course have to let her use my stereo and tv. I also am the only one that really cleans,  this is just bothering me. ot has only been eight minutes. abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz I have never done the alphabet on the keybourd before. abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz how fun:) well, this day sucks. I'm still tired and I just took a two hour nap. I only have one class today and its from 8-9:30 so I have the rest of the day. I really need to do my math homework, I can't stand the professor. he is not very good at teaching. ahhhhhhhhhhhh I'm so anoyed. I feel like I am writing  a letter. okay, when is this instant messenger thing going to finish downloading. its taking forever, I only want to talk to my friends online. no one is ever really on thoukgh so it doesn't really matter. man, I should have brought my discman. I am never going to catch up on the readings I am supposed to do for english and biology. I missed last friday's bio class because my stupid alarm didnt go off. I had set the clock wrong so it said pm instead of am. I felt so dumb, so now I have a buinch of notes to catch up on. !@#$%^&*() HDJHHFGHLKJHSDjljkLKJHFHFHFNVJDUEKASKJDHFUKTHJLKASJHDHFHFH only seven more minutes??????    okay, I still have bio to read, english to print out, and I still have to finish the survey online for this class. maybe if I type slower the time will go bye more quickly. alright, I can't wait till this weekend because I will have more free time, I really need to meet more people. this is not really helping. :) :(:) :( :) :9:0 messed up  -------+++++++++++++============= I wonder if you can draw pictures  ==  ==        *  -------------   @ its a face sticking its tonge out, how cute "
Tell me about yourself.,"College is so cool. I really can't remember the last time I felt so many emotions at the same time. I've already met so many incredible and different people I can't even begin to describe all of them. I am definately having mixed thoughts about having a boyfriend at this moment because of all the new people I have met and would definately like to meet, get to know, and date. My boyfriend is totally mad because he is so jealous. I hate jealous people I wish everyone would just, I don't know go along with it. I ate the grosests food in jester cafeteria today and had the weirdest conversation with two very interesting and cool guys that I have already met from camptexas. That was like almost the most fun I've had in a really long time I'm so glad I decided to go and wasn't to scared. I was so scared about coming to UT  because it is so big and I just didn't know if I could adjust after going to such a small catholic school. I'm so glad to be away from old people and meeting knew ones. High school was such an almost horrible experience, I hope college is so much better. So I'm in this room with these two guys, one who I met at camptexas and he looks exactly like the guy from rookie of the year he doesn't know it but I have this incredible, horrible, obssesion with him. He is just the hottest guy I have ever seen. So I met this really cool guy from tarytown in New York which is like the place I've been obssessed with since forever. He is a guy I would really like to hang out with. This other guy who is rookie of the years roomate is totally obssessed with Britany Spears I really can't stand her but I think it is just because I am so jealous that he likes her more than me. And Drew has almost naked women pictures all over his wall that makes me very jealous and I was just thinking about jealous people. The music is blasting in my ear I don't know who it is. Drew complains a lot about college ruled spirals and needing more space. I really hate that my roomate and myself don't have much in common. Everyone else seems to be like best friends with their roomates I need a really good girl friend to hang out with. Or maybe I'm just ment to have guy friends. I guess it would be okay with me I get along with  them better. I think classes are going to be really fun and not too hard. Which is really a relief because I though it would be really hard. I've seen so many interesting people. I miss my parents like crazy and my dogs and sisters. I would never trade this experience for going to UTEP that would really suck. I really miss my friend Bianca and Anne. I think for labor day we are going to San Antonio if Anne and Lianna and Vero come up. I was thinking about Noodles the other day I wonder how she is. This is got to be one of the funnest assigments I have ever done. I really think I might double major whith something in Psychology because the human mind is an incredible thing. Well my 20 minutes seem to be up that kind of sucks I guess I could really write forever I need to go write my parents and some friends e-mails and then read a little for Biology and probably go to sleep I'm really tired. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am often asked what I am thinking about at the moment and I can never put them into words or many time I don't' want to but I guess I am forced to right now. I am at home right now for the labor day holiday and all I've been doing is homeowrk. Whoever said that college was going to be fun was wrong. or so I think. I'm constantly going to classes and when I'm not I'm doing homework related to it. Well I guess I can't say that college is all bad. I have been to my share of parties and those are always fun except for soem of the people you meet. Especially those stupid thug guys who think they are all that. They walk aroung with their pants about to fall off with their friends talkign abotu how many girls they are going to sleep with this year. And what the funny aprt is, spome of the girls are actually attracted to those greasy guys. They are constantly after then and soem of them even fight over them. Some of these guys have been in jail like 6 times and can barely even read. DOn't these epople ever wonder about what they are going to do with thte rest of their life or is that just a foriegn concept that they just can't learn? I don't' know why I am bitching about this, I just find it a little ridiculous how girls are always chasing after guys who are idiots. And besides that why are girls always trying to impress guys. I don't know why I'm going off abotu this. I'm not a feminist who is totally against guys or anything. Actually I'm the total opposite. But anyways, when ever I'm asked to talk abotu what I'm thinking about I go blank. I can't seem to think abotu anything. But one thing has coem to me. My aunt was ina coma for over a year and dies justa couple of months ago. I always think abotu her and my uncle and cousin. I feel so bafd for my cousin. he is only 2 years old and he is never going to get to know his mother. A lot of us take that forgranted and that really irritates me. I am HIndu and we believe in reincarnation and when soemthing horrible happens it makes you wonder what happened in past lives to cause he such misery. We believe that you are punished for your wrongdoings in your next life but life does improve for you every time. Supposedly you becoem a better person each time and everyone works towards a common goal and that goal is to be truly happy, just and basically as close to perfect as you can get. Every life makes you better and helps you move closer to that goal. But of coarse it takes more times for some than others, I think. Lately I have been discussing my religion a lot. I met this guy who never knew anyone who was HIndu. He just found that so fascinating and I couldn't believe that someone had never met a HIndu. That kinda shows how segregated we all are and how we tend to stay within our same culture and try not to stray to far from it. I mean I have many friends who are not Indian and I have no prooblem with any kind of race, but I do have to admit that I do tend to be better friends and stay closer to those of the smae culture. I think this is true of a lot of peopel and not just me. But there are very few who are willing to accept this fact. One thing that does annoy me abotu this is how some people treat me liek I'm stupid until they learn that I was born in America. I see a lot of racism with my parents because they do have an accent and that really gets me mad. If anyone is ever disrespectign my mother in front of me I will let them know and trust me I am not soft spoken. I don't' know where people get off thinking that they are better than us. My parents came from India with very little money and now if I may say so my self we are probably more successful than those fools who feel that they have to show that they are better than us. Anyways, on to a more lighter topic, psycology. have I mentioned that I think that it is one of my favorite classes even though there is 500 people in it. And I'm not just saying it to suck up or anything but I really do enjoy it and I look forward to comign to it everytime. Its not one of those boring classes where all we do is sit there and take notes. even with such a big classthere is a lot of interaction which is really important to me. Well my time is up. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now I'm feeling kind of stressed about school. economics especially. I'm really not enjoying that class. it is difficult and I haven't met anyone in the class I can ask for help. the only reason I'm taking this class is because I want to transfer to the business school. and if I don't like economics I'm wondering if all this work I'm doing is worth it. am I going to work really hard in economics all year, get into the business school and then realize I don't even like business?  I sure hope not. the reason I chose business is because I like math and I like english but I don't want to major in just math or english and business seemed to be the right combination of both. I've also thought about opening my own gymnastics or cheerleading gym when I grow up and business would really help me do that. I just hope what I'm doing right now will pay off for something in the end. I'm also torn as to wether I want to try out for the diving team. I dove in high school part time and I thought I would give it a try in college. I really wanted to cheer for texas and I tried out but didn't make it so diving is the next best thing. I don't know though if I should concentrate on cheerleading and join an allstar squad and then tryout again next year or if I should give diving a shot to be involved with an organization at ut. I thought I was going to be happy with diving but now that school has started I'm not so sure anymore. I am really enjoying myself right now without diving. I have some free time, I'm not stressed cause I have a lot to do all the time like in high school but I wonder if diving will make me more stressed and I worry I won't have enough time to study and my grades will fall. it is really important to me to make good grades right now. I am worried I am going to get to my first test and not know anything. I feel like I'm studying right now and doing all my homework and so forth but I don't know if when it comes down to it if I'm really going to konw the information. I think I'm just nervous about taking a college test. I don't know what to expect and I think after my first test I wll be ok with everything. its just what I don't know is what makes me nervous. "
Tell me about yourself.,I am so tired of school already and I want to go home and sleep in my bed and see all of my old friends I hate computers with a passion my stupid ethernet does not work and the front desk says there is nothing they can do all I can do is to call a number which I have been doing and getting no answer ireally miss Charley but he is coming to visit the weekend after labor day there are so many people fromschool in my psy class that I cannot stand and all of my classes area assignning so much reading for us if I read what I am suppose to I'd end up reading over threehundred pages a day and there is no way thatt is possible for me to do Biology is the worst class that I have the teacher is so boring and rambles on so fast which is really pathetic since bio is my major for the time being I have had the worst headache ever sonce I've been in Austin I just want to go home for a while and have my summer back it was so much nicer not doing anything all day except for hanging out with friends and parting all night I wish we could smoke inside I am on the thirteenth floor which is a pain to wait for an elevator just to smoke and when it gets cold inthe winter its really going to suck ireally don't mind any of my classes except bio but what if I drop the major and it was just because of the  teacher from this yearwho ruined it for me when if I had another teacher I might have acctually enjoyed the subject I am so tired of reading maybe I'll switch my major to math that is so much easier for me but what can you do with math besides be a teacher I really don't want to be a teacher because I hate kids I never want to have kids they are such a pain I really   don't see why any one has them tons of my friends back home have them Kim's kid is the devil himself he is so crazy and he's barely three I would not be able to raise another person for eightteen years straight  my head is really starting to pound everyone heere is trying to convince me to stop smoking but I think that would drive me insane and I'd be a really bitchy  person to everyone then I probally gian a ton of weight because if I am not somking  I am eating that's another problem with this whole college thing getting fat I was ten pounds lighter like six months ago and now if I gian any more I am going to go crazy maybe I should take metabolife pills but I don't feel like driving to the mall in rush hour traffic oh well iguess I'll just watch what I eat or at least try to  I really want charley to come to austin and visit soon he is the one person I really mis  since I've been gone thats weird cause I haven't missed my brothers at all  I never really got along with them any way maybe once we grow up we'll get along better  I don't really care now anyway my head hurts so bad I think I'll take a nap before I read ay of the billions of pages that I have for homework twenty minutes is over up all done with this one 
Tell me about yourself.,While sitting on my computer many thougts and feelings come into my head. I have now been at school for alsmost 3 weeks and I can't believe it. School is finally becoming a reality. It has just started to feel like home. I am from out of state and when I came to school I felt like I was at sleep a way camp trying to meet my friends for the next month. It is true I am not at camp anymore. It has been hard for me lately because I miss home. I miss my family and friends. It seemed to me at the beginning of school that everyone new each and I was the outcast. It has been hard finding friends even though everyone is very nice. It is different here because my closest friends aren't here with me. I came from a very close group of friends and we each went different directions. I am ready to meet new people but I want them to be like my best friends at home and that is not gooing to happen. I have to understand that I will become close to the people here at school I just have to give it time. I also miss my family tremendusly. I am very close to my family and try to talk to them at least once a day but talking is not the same a seeing them. It is very wierd not seeing my sister. We are 3 years apart but we are extremly close. Every time I talk to her I get a tear in my eye. The thought of not seeing her for another month makes me very upset. She told me the other day that she felt like I was on a trip and coming home. She tells me all the time how much she misses me and that makes the situation worse. I can't wait to see her and my parents. I have a very unique realationship with my parents. They are also like my best friends. I feel I can tell them anything. The are my inspiratin and my confindence in one. I have had a lot on my ming latly about school I am very nervous about all the work and tests. I feel as though it is going to be a lot harder that high school. It has been very hard to get back into the school mode but I am starting to get back in to it. I have had a lot of distractions latly with the sorority and and tring to meet eveyone to make friends but I realize I have to start putting school in front of all that. I am here for school and I need to start putting effort in to it. I am very dilgent and like to get my work done but I don't want to stress myself out. Even though school is very important I still need to have fun. I need to balence myself. I feel that it might take some time to get adjusted but it will all work out. School has definately been tough but it has resently gotten better and I know it will get better each day I am here. I am so glad that I made the decision to come to UT and experience this great school.       
Tell me about yourself.,"Presently my thought are on my sororities 75th Anniversary this weekend. So far I have not ben able to find a place to get my hair done; which is a problem because I have very long hair. The guy that I am going with is pretty cool. We met about a week and a half ago and things are going well. Since, I have no family coming in for parents weekend I am probably going to ask him to the game but I am not sure. I mean I enjoy his company and all but the shortness of time that I have known him and that is not for 3 weeks. I don't know what to do about it but I have to ask before midnight because I need his ID so that he can be in my sororoties block at the game. Being new around here and not knowing many people is a problem when you need dates for all kinds of things. It is hard to go up and ask a guy to something who you have only talked to once or none. It's difficult being from out of state. It seems like everyone else knows everyone else. I knowe that this is not true but that is how it seems. Getting used to the whole college thing is different. I do have my sister around so that is nice but I have not lived near her for four years so in a way it is kind of strange as well. I had a bought of homesickness last week. I tried to call my best friend to hear a friendly voice but she was not home. My other best friend was there and I talked to her, well woke her up and said hi-bye kind of thing. The net was my only way to talk to them then without disturbing anyone else because my third best freind has not left for college yet. I wrote her a long letter via email and poured my heart out. With just meeting people it is kind of hard to cry on someones shoulder . I don't know I just don't like to cry in front of poeple who I do not know. don't want them to know that I have a weakness. To everyone else I like to come off as a very stronge and together person who can handle any situation. Plus, the people hear do not know me well at all and for me to start spewing off all of my problems or thoughts might put a burden on someone else or drive them away. It takes a lot for me to be able to trust someone with my feeling. My car, my clothes, anything else but not my soul. Living with another person who I had never met before was an experience unto itself. The first morning at 6:30am her boyfreind was over and stayed the entire weekend. I am glad that she is enjoying her freedom away form home but not in my room when I barely knew her. I don't like having to stay in friends rooms my first weekend at school. It just was not cool because I had just met all of them, tooo. Just a bad situation all together. I just do not like being put in that situation. I won't do it to her. If I want to hang with one of my guy friends to al hoursa of the morning I go to his place or in the lounge or something. That is just not write. Typing non-stop like this is kind of difficult. I never took tying so I am constantly looking at the keys and thinking that I am running out of things to say with much time left. Funny how your mind sort of goes blank when asked to talk about such a loose subject as your thoughts. Not too much longer. I am most of the way there. Lack of thoughts here. It is interesting to move away and to think about how different things would be if so and so did not choose this school. The girl who I have found that I have connected is from out of state too. If I didn't have her I do not know what I would do. We did not get into the same sororities but that is cool because now instaed of gluing to eachother we are meeting many other poeople. It's definitely different here than in Louisisana. The manner that peopel have and the culture and such. I am so excited that for one of my theatre classes I get to go see the play Vieaux Carre which I am believing is based in New Olreans although I have never heard of it before. I know A Street Car Named Desire but not that one. I just do not know. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I have too much homework to do. It is really different from high school where you could finish your homework in a couple of hours. The homework in UT requires you to read a whole lot and complete an enormous amount of homework in a short amount of time. Also, at UT, you must manage your time wisely becuase you are on your own and there is no one to bug you are pester you about your time management. Also, there are a lot of distractions like girls, basketball, sleep, etc. Going to early classes has been hard for me so far. It is really hard to stay awake for the 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock classes becuase some are just too boring because of boring professors that like to lecture over meaningless material because no one understands it. I think that if they should teach like they did in high school where they show examples of the things that they are talking about, or go at a slower pace so everyone can understand. This is because once you are lost, you really don't want to have to work really hard to get back up to speed. I really think that my GPA is important this semester becuase I am trying to transfer into the business school and out of the college of natural science. This is becuase I do not like computer science which is my current major, and business seems easier and a better track to go. Today in psychology class we learned an intereting lesson on lie detection. It kind of lost its point since the professor could not tell what the student's number really was. I want my parents to bring me a bike to UT. It is because the campus is just too big and it is too hot to walk to all of my classes. But I kind of don't want a bike on one hand because it will mess up my hair, you will have to pedal over hills, and cars don't really care about bikers as much as pedestrians. I am kind of pissed that the school is closing Gregory Gym tomorrow because they are throwing the plaza party. I think that they should have it somewhere else because a lot of people like myself like to play basketball there at night. Plus it is already too congested at night because they hold volleyball games on other courts during the night too. I really think that the UT football team is going to do well this year. Although they blew a big first game, I think that they have a chance to do something either this year or next year. I don't understand why Chris Simms chose to come to Texas over Tennessee. He is such a good quarterback to be a backup. I think he should be starting over Major Applewhite even though he lacks experience because he has a good arm and he is more atheletic. I really don't like to do these things because it takes so much time. When I first started typing I didn't realize how long 20 minutes is, but it is a long time. When I finish this, I need to start on my english paper, and do my calculus problems. My calculus TA is really stupid because she cannot teach us. She skips too many steps, and she can't explain problems very well. I think that radio stations should not have morning shows. This is because I was listening to a radio station in the morning that didn't use to have a morning show because they were new, but now they have one and it sucks because they play so much less music. Also, they always talk about really corny stuff that no one wants to pay attention to. I like it when it rains. But here in Austin is never seems to rain. I've been here for 2 1/2 weeks now and not a drop of rain. When it rains I feel better for some reason. Tomorrow is probably my best day of classes because I don't have to wake up until 12 in the afternoon. And all my classes are basically the discussion groups where you don't learn anything. I like a girl here are UT but I don't know if she likes me back. But I am also faced with the dilema of liking another girl that goes to Emory in Atlanta. The girl that I like in UT though does send me any signals that she likes me or even agknowledges that I am there. She also hangs around a lot of other guys that makes me pretty jealous. The girl in Emory is a girl that I've known for 4 years and I think I stand a better chance with her, but I hear that long distance realtionships never work out. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Today I am very tired. Because last night I was up to two am to do my chemistry lab reports. First I thought it was easy and it wouldn't take me so long to do it. But actually it required a lot of consideration and calculations. After I finished writing the report, I found out that the report must be typed. The problem was I don't have a printer at home, and at that time, it was already ten at night. I didn't want to go to the library so late but didn't want to get it done at the last minutes of tomorrow morning. I went to knock at my neighbours' doors and asked them if they had a printer I could borrow. The lucky thing was that the second one I asked does has a printer and he let me borrowed it. So the problem had been solved. Then after this I kept on writing my Chemistry prelimenary write up. I needed put the procedures and data table up. That was a very long lab, there were totally seven experiments I need to do today and it spent me like eight pages for the pre-lab write up. So today morning I went to the lab room and turned in my lab report at the beginning of class. I am glad that I finally got it done, but I don't know what would the grade be since I was in a hurry last night. Then I start to do my experiments. It took me almost four hours to finish and after that I was so exhausted since I didn't eat breakfast in the morning. My data was so messy and I don't know if I could read them when I need to write the lab report again. After the lab, the first thing came up my mind was to go home and have a nice big sandwhich. At one o'clock, I had my math discussion class. I almost felt to sleep during that class since the topic the TA discussed was kind of boring and I already knew them. After this class, I had my Biology discussion class. This class is pretty cool because it took like 15 minutes then we could go home. So I went home and get on the line to have a little rest. I was chatting with my friends, checking email, and surfing until my roommate came back. Then we did dinner together. Tonight's dinner was good and it was the thing I enjoyed the most today!   Ah, two minutes left. finally, so what else I need to say?  So after the yummy dinner I started to write this assignment, and now time is up. I can go on to the next writing assignment. my hands are so tired "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am hoping that I will be able to keep up with my thoughts for twenty minutes. It is only 8:12 and I still have 20 minutes to go. I wonder if Jared is doing ok. I hope he ate. I was really happy to see him eat so much at lunch today. I hope I don't get in trouble for sitting with him in his cafeteria. Today was so hot. I am definatley wearing shorts tomorrow. But that shirt is dark red, I hope it won't absorb too much heat. I must have lost at least 10 lbs of water today. It is riduculous how bad my schedule is. One hour in class, the next three sitting somewhere. God, finding FAC is going to be my semester goal. I can't believe how hard it is to find that building. No one else has trouble finding it but me. Maybe I have some kind of direction learning disability. I wonder if I have missplelled any words. does misspell have a hyphen? My head hurts. I must be because I am tired. Maybe because I have had my hair pulled back all day. I hope I can find that building tomorrow before I go to class. I hope history isn't boring. With my luck it will be awful. An hour and a half contemplating how the Germans felt about this and that. Why did I sign up for that class. I am doing a pretty good job typing. I hope they didn't want this in a certain form. AOL is such a waste of money. I wonder if Jared got me into the draw. I hope so. I can't wait till the game on Saturday. It will be so much fun. I hope his roomate likes me. I felt weird today just sitting there. I need to make some friends. My head hurts so badly. I need to go to bed early tonight. I don't have to get up half as early tomorrow as I did today. I think we are going to have to find a better way of comunicating. I was almost in tears when I couldn't find him. I wonder if he was mad at me. I hope not. I wish he would show more interest in me. Hopefully it is just because school started today. I guess they call it class and not school. I really didn't feel overwhelmed today. I am so tired. Only ten more minutes. I feel like I am writing a letter. I wonder how Casey and Anh are doing. I haven't heard from Lauren in about four months. She can be ridiculous when she wants to be. I wonder if she thinks I moved? I hope she doesn't come here for college. i know I would have to be her room mate and everything I did would be reported to everybody and their brother. I wonder why I have been using ""everybody and their dog"" latley. Perhaps no one has heard and their brother, so I feel weird saying it. I was really amazed that I got that great spot in the garage today. I think it was the same one that I parked in last night. I felt really bad for using the elevator to go up one level, but my hip was hurting terribly. It better go away for tomorrow. I hope I didn't miss a class today. All these discussion classes are going to drive me insane. Life would be much easier if I had a decent schedule. i think she is going deaf. Between the two of them, my God. She has been edgy lately. There can't be much stress doing what she does. What would happen if she saw this. I wonder if she would get upset and yell. Probably. I can't wait till it gets cooler. Better yet, I can't wait till Christmas break. I wonder how many people at UT celebrate Christmas. I need to start shopping for presents. I need to wrap the gifts that I have. Caitlin's birthday is in A FEW DAYS. Where does the time go? I wonder if this rambling means I'm crazy? I wouldn't be surprised. I can stop now. "
Tell me about yourself.,"well, topday when I was sitting in the cafeteria, I was thinking about something. my roommate mike, said to me, ""congratulations for not cursing for over a certain period of time. ""  that was kinda strange because I don't usually curse until I came onto this campus. I have no idea why. he asked me if I did it at home a lot, but the truth is, no I don't. I don't usually curse. the only time I ever did that was if I felt pain or something. I never felt the need to curse and I know that it's a filthy habit. I also know that it's not a very classy thing to do. I can't figure it out. I have noticed that I curse a lot and I've made attempts to stop. but the truth is, I don't really want to because it's fun. I don't to it often enough. well, at least that's the conclusion I came up with. that's really been the only thing on my mind other than girls and big breast and stuff like that. that's kind strange too, because I know that it's not important to me. it's actually very superficial, but I don't care. I have fun talking in vulgar manners to my friends and stuff like that but that's not me at all. I know that it's not but I can't stop sometimes. well, I can but I choose not too. . FIRE DRILLL!!!  oh well. last I left off was awhile ago. I kinda lost train of thought. I don't remember what I wrote and I don't feel like reading what I wrote. now I feel kinda tired because I walked up the 13 flights of stairs. I wasn't as tiring for me as it was for my friends. I'm expecting some letters from my little sister. she's suppose to send me some important stuff like my id and credit card and stuff like that. I'm kinda worried because if someone steals the credit card, I'll be in big trouble.  a couple of my friends do drugs and have already had sex and stuff like that. I hate to pass judgements and crap like that so I pretend that it's all good. I don't even know if it's a good a idea to confront them about it. well, it's not like they're my friends or anything like that, but I did meet them here. I don't know how confidential this writting assignment is so I don't want to say too much. lets just say that I see no evil, hear no evil, and speak no evil. I'm not sure what I'm suppose to write about. I know that it's stream of consciouness but if there's nothing on my mind, what am I suppose to write about. the first time I heard about this, I thought about hemingway and his style of writting. students that went to my high school studied hemingway and I at least know that he wrote stream of consciousness.  I wonder if I'm out of breath. would that effect how well I think. cause I'm writing this stupid assignment, and I seem to have trouble because I'm thinking too much about breathing. I always have this huge headache. I think it was because it was hot outside and now it's cold. I don't know. I don't care.  actually, this assignment is kinda of easing because I can just write whatever I want and know that as long as I turn it in, I'm ok. no matter what I say or how I say it, it's all good.  but, when I came in the room after that firedrill, I didn't want to do anything but lie on my bed. I'm sleeping and my mind is wondering off in some weird way. I know I have to write for 20 min. and I have another 3-4 min. to go. I don't want to do this anymore. I'm tired. I'm not even thinking anymore. I got to pee, but I don't want to unless I'm finished with this assignment. man I got to pee. ok, I'm going to end this assignment now that I think I'm done. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am so tired. I cannot wait to go home tomorrow and sleep in my own bed. I really didn't think I would miss home that much, but apparently I do. Seriously, I cannot wait to go in the car and drive back to Kingwood. But it's not like I am homesick. Well, actually I guess I am homesick, but it's not for my family. To be quite honest, everytime I talk to my mother, she annoys me. But what I do miss is my bed. Not the house, because we don't' live in the house anymore. NO, we have to move two months before I leave for college. What were my parents thinking???  Obviously they weren't. But I do miss Garden Point. I really want to go back to MY room. But, now I have no room. Honestly, I do not consider my dorm room MY room. Thinking of, I definitely need to bring back some more stuff. Pictures and frames - stuff like that. My room mate brought so much crap. It makes my side of the room look so bare. But at the same time, I DID bring a lot of stuff. Anyways, this weekend. My date with Hal. I really don't want to go at all. I know that I completley led him on. I mean I could have told him that I was joking, but I didn't. I basically told him that I liked him. BUT HAROLD PITMAN! - UGH!  I still sound like I am totally in highschool. I know that in college you are supposed to throw away all your passt conceptions of people, but how can I do that about the guy who teased me for like 3 years. How many times can you say, ""But Mr. Blayney, I'm only eleven?""  and think it to be funny. I swear in seventh grade I could have shot him and Ryan Ochoa. Ryan Ochoa is another boy, who I would never ever date. When he got to be such a heart throb in high school is beyond me. But then again, I never ever thought that I would have a crush on Cyrus. I am such a hypocrit. The amount of time I was telling Gio, not to like him and not to go for him. But then again, Gio and Cyrus would not have lasted anyways. Gio is so prude, Cyrus would have either dumbed her or cheated on her pretty quickly. Gosh, I really hope that this assginment is completion, or else you will think that I am a really shallow and superficial person. Not to meniton judgemental. But actually what can you expect coming from Kingwood High School - thrid snobbiest school in the nation???  I seriously had fun at high school, but it definitley was a different type of fun than the type of fun I'm having now. I mean in high school I hardly ever drank really, until my senior year. But even then it wasn't EVERY weekend like I do now. I mean, we used to do stupid stuff like go to the airport and play airport tag, wrap or in the case of Dawn ""condimenting"" houses. But now, it's frat parties every weekend. Not that I am complaining, because I am hanging out with Brandon - what a hottie. But he is so rude. and Kimberly - honestly, I havent' talked to her since 7th grade. It is so wierd how people who were so close are now so far appart. But anyways, maybe the frat parties and the drinking is what is making me so tired, because I am pretty sure that I had less sleep that I am having now in highschool. Is this even stream of consciousness??? I ended up talkign about the same thing I began with, but I guess it is because I did go off on several tangents. But oh well - time's up! "
Tell me about yourself.,"When I was young, I always like to lied. I remember one day I lied to my mother that I went to library to study. But instead, I went to the nearest video game center to play arcade. When come back from home, I told my mother that I study very hard in the library. After I said that,  my grandmother smile at me for a moment which last for about few seconds. At that time, somehow I got strange feeling that something is wrong, but I am not very sure about that. I kept thinking about the wicked smile that my grandmother gave it to me within that two or three seconds. Then I decided to analyse this situation carefully. First, when I lied to mother at that moment, did I carelessly  show any sign of unordinany behavior, like shaking my body or showing a very dishonest face without I knowing it. Second, did I say something wrong or stupid, that have indirectly showed me I am lying at that moment. Third,  did my clothes have any cigarette smell?  Or did some of the people saw me enter the video game center and tell the incident to my mother?  Or is it my grandmother just want to smile and being nice to me, and I am the one who is too sensitive about the smiling incident?  Even though I made many hypothesis, but I still could not figure if something is really wrong. I am kind of nervous and just keeping thing that incident. After dinner, my mother asked me why does it take me so long to finish my study, and I told her I have a lots of homework to do. Then she said I was lying because my sister had followed me and seen me enter the video game store. At last, this incident had ended, and it also prove me that my six sense is correct. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Tired, stressed, already sick of school and it has only been the first week. What can I say other than I have to do great this semester. I never knew that school would be this stressful. There are so many things going on in my life right now that I really do not have time for. I feel like my brain is on overload and don't know when I am going to get all of this stuff done. Hungry, what can I say, I am always craving something. I am sitting in my dorm room all alone because my friends have all gone out to this Sig Ep party and I opted to stay home and catch up on things that I need to get done. I hate typing too. Although typing is a lot easier to do because it is a lot faster. I just hate it when I mess up and hit the wrong key. It really irritates me when my phone rings late at night and it is one of my friends from home and you can't understand a word they are saying because they have been out partying all night long. Have you ever noticed that when people have had a little too much to drink that they get real emotional?  When I returned home last night from being out, one of my friends from home was hysterically crying over something a guy said to her at a party. He commented on what she was wearing and obviously she took it the wrong way and got mad. Of course I knew it was no big deal, but she really thought it was. This morning, of course, she ran into my room wondering what had happened last night and why she got upset. It was such a big deal last night, but this morning she was so embarrassed. I have done the same thing that she did. Gosh, I miss my parents and I never really thought that I would. My senior year I was so tired of the high school scene. I think I was the only one of my friends that hated my senior year. Well, I can't say that I absolutely hated it, but I was ready to go on to bigger and better things. My boyfriend lived here, so maybe that's why I wanted to leave home so badly. My phone bill is going to be so high this semester. I talk to all of my friends so much on the phone. I also talk to my parents a lot too. I especially talk to my mom. I was always so close to my mom and it is hard to be away from her. I could always drive home one weekend. It is not very far away. I just found out today that we are going to have to go to ten hours of study hall every week. It sounds bad, but I really think this is good for me especially coming into my freshman year and trying to get adjusted to this new life that I am leading now. I was always independent, but now I feel that I am on my own for good. I really like only depending on myself for things. "
Tell me about yourself.,"First of I would like to clear something up. Yes you did pay for Bally's but for the money you paid I wore Walamrt and Target clothes and Payless Shoes. I also hardly think that the $30 a month you paid for me equates to the Hundreds you pay for Andrew. Second I paid for that Fronce trip myself and then paid my self back at S&S. In no way did you go into debt in anyway on my behalf. I did earn a lot of money this summer. I spent very little of it and saved most of it - so YOU wouldn't have to pay for stuff in college. I don't think having a car is a sign of love- I think it is a sign of favoritism. That's what makes me cry and get really upset. The two main reason's Andrew got a car was not that he has a job (that's why he's keepiong it) but because he's a male and Dad obviously identifies with him more. Nevermind that I try to save money, do well in school, or generally try to make life easy for you. I guess maybe if I act like an obnoixious bastard, and think only of myself, and step over every one I could get a little appreciation in this family. Having a car here is imparactical and honestly, I don't know what y'all can do to make me feel any better about that car thing. The damamge is done. My whole life I felt loved and I'm not saying I don't fell it now but the car thing and then you trying to play it off as acceptable was a big blow. I was very upset. Not that I didn't mean what I wrote, but I could of said it in a kinder way. I had a really long talk about it with Will and he made me feel a little better about it- the car thing. The reason I get so upset is not because I want a car (it's impractical here) it's that it symbolizes something. Logically I know it means nothing, but I still hurt when I think about it. I'm really confused. I think I get emotional about it because I think it's so unfair, I can't do anything about it, and I get so mad I cry. Another thing I have observed is I can't talk to dad about it. I don't know why I feel it necessary to ""protect him"" from me being sad about something he had a large part in. I guess it's the same logic that made me not ask more than twice for a car myself- he always looked really sad that ""he couldn't afford it"" I can't even really talk about it with you; I have to write about it. I guess it's because we've communicated through notes for as long as I can remember. Maybe I get sad about it because I don't understand why I feel this way and no one understands my feelings. I really meant it when I said I didn't know what could return me to the way I felt before the incident. And all the while I'm thinking what a ridiculous reaction to a car. I was upset about it at home, but here there's a lot of time to think. Here, no one LOVES me. sure maybe as a friend but not the same kind of love that I was SURE of at home. The car thing left me a tiny bit less sure of that love so that's why I'm upset about it. I KNOW that objects don't measure love. It's just that you don't do such an unjust thing to someone you love- give a hugely expensive, and a sign of higher status to someone younger and less considerate. I guess it's really the injustice that hurts me. This letter itself is really ironic in some way. I write to soften the blow to your feelings when you obviously didn't think of my feelings at all -and here I am up at midnight worrying about yours. well I'm going to bed now, I've got school and work tomorrow. "

Tell me about yourself.,"I wonder what my mother is doing right now. I hope that she is taking the news of the weekend plans well. If I hadn't told I think I would have felt guilty. Yeah guilty. Jeremy sure is excited about it so screw what she thinks I am going to be happy and if she gets mad at that than to bad for her. My father thinks it's okay. I mis my father I miss my bed I miss my House and my dog My dog that is one great dog I can;t wait for the weekend. Showering with shoes is getting old and I have only done it for a week and I am ready to take a shower with out shoes. Grandma food can't wiat to get grandma food.

I can't ever get that right. Carol is cleaning I wonder if she will notice that I am writing about her she is great I like all of the people that I have met and my mother didn't think that I would make any friends. SHe was so wrong I think that 20 minutes is way to long my brain actually feels tired I wonder why that is It's probably because I wonder about too many things too many things I can't wait for Halloween maybe I'll go to a costume party that would be fun I havn't gone to one of those in a while I'm sure that there will be one some where around campus I love Chickfila Carol has a chikfila cow I think that's great I think maybe I should have bought one of those as well. I wish I had but than again I am a college student and like all other college students I have no money. No money I wish I had money it would make life so much easier or would maybe not maybe so that's a good question to ask myself money probably would make me lazy which would make me fat Yuck>  I am so excited about this weekend it makes me so happy to think about showering without shoes on and real food and all of the animals at Sea WOrld Its been a long time since I went to sea World to see all of the shows. This ime I am going to watch the shows so Jeremy can see them and that is Oma's favorite part the shows I always upset her beacuse I hate the shows this time she will be happy. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Okay, I think this is going to be hard for me to do because honestly I'm not sure if someone will be reading this and if they will think that what I say is stupid or I am doing it wrong but perhaps that is a stupid thing to say also since I just clearly read that there is no right or wrong thing to say. so basically I have just entered this new sort of world. I am now what I would call a real person. that is, I am no longer totally dependent on a parental figure or figures as it were. this is like a whole new life for me. right now I suppose I am lonely, living by myself and so from this statement stems the thought that has haunted me for days: should I be living in a dorm instead of my own apartment and I could go on and on thinking this but I will always come to the same conclusion. And that is that either way there are advantages and disadvantages, and besides that there is no reason to play the what if game because I already live in an apartment and there is no way that I could even get into a dorm at this point. But I know that that is my nature. That is, to think about things that I can't change. I always wonder well, if I had done it that way then this would have happened or wouldnt have happened. I hate that I do that. there really is no point. I can't change the past so I don't really understand why I waste the present regretting past decisions or thinking about what could have been if only. of course, I have tons of regrets in my life. maybe I just I don't know. I honestly don't know why I can't just be happy with the decisions I make for myself. it all goes back to my stupid nature of always envying other people. I tend to look at what they have and think that I could be like that if only I. it could be any thing. I just hate always being envious of others and thinking that they are better than me because. the list could go on and on. Really I don't know why I am not satisfied with the way I am. I mean I know that I don't have self esteem problems but still I am always thinking that I need some sort of improvement. I really should be happy with myself. I have done a lot of good things for myself and I have a lot going for me unlike others for example tracy walker. but still I can take a person like that and still find things in her that I envy. I must say that is pretty pathetic of me. w wish I knw why I even cared about tracy or the whole lake dallas crew. I mean, I spent my whole life with these people playing the little game that everyone played the lake dallas way all up until my last year when I realized how unbelievably stupid it all was. its weird how my junior and senior year my outlook on life totally changed from the way that I saw things my freshman and sophomore year. now there is a time that I wish I could go back to. I hadnt made any stupid mistakes yet. I didnt have any enemies I had tons of friends I was secure with myself and for christ sake I wore a freaking size 6. lord, life was good back then and I really just wish that I could go back to it sometimes. I am beginning to wonder if life will ever be as great as it was then. I know that sounds pathetic but I still have to wonder. everyone days college is so great but I just hope that the social aspect will pick up soon. I feel as if I am behind or maybe I just don't know how to have fun like I used to. I think that I just need to find friends that I am truly comfortable with and a boyfriend wouldnt be bad either. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I notice that my mind always wonders off to the things in my life that I wish were better. I tend to think about the differences between what I should be doing in my life right now, and what I am doing. I also find that one person in particular continues to pop into my head, a girl no less, one that I knew about a year ago, only for a brief period of time, but I miss her every day. I also have thoughts of longing to be back home, with my mom and my dogs. I miss high school. I built up a large list of friends over a span of twelve years, and now all of a sudden I'm starting from scratch again. Like kindergarten in a way. I also feel the pressure of my mouting homework that continues to pile up, atop of which sits two gigantic architecture projects, both of which are do in a shorter amount of time then I am capable of finishing them in. Life is getting harder. Being a kid was so easy. I want to be a rock star. the path was set, my band was doing great, writing songs, about to cut our first albm, when college ripped us apart. Nothing makes sense anymore. Take me home. "
Tell me about yourself.,"right now I'm a little bit stressed anb  about getting all my homework done that is do on friday due tommorrow  and getting enough sleeop at the same time  never enough time   too much to due too little time  I also need to clean up my room and do the dishes. I should also say that I only have one arm to type this because the other one is in a cast so I probably wont write as much as everyone else. although have a lot of homework to do tonite, I'm happy because I only have one class tomorrow and then the weekend is here and I don't have any classes to go to. I'm also happy that this is such an easy assignment and that we get credit for it. my roomate is bothering me quite a bit at the moment cause he wont shut up. I really don't like him very much, but at least he is just my roomate and I don't have to hang out with him. now I hope that he doesn't see what I wrote. I'm excited about this weekend cause it will be time to get away from school. I don't know or care what I'm doing though. maybe I shouldnt feel this way so early in the year, but I just don't feel like doing all of the work I have to do for school, I would rather just sit in the living room and watch tv and relax. I'm tired now and I feel like going to sleep, but the nthought of my math hw wont let me relax until it is all done. now I'm wondering if someone is actually going to read all of these writing assignments, I feel sorry for whoever has to do that, but I guess they are divided up between the ta's. my twenty mins is almost up so I'm thinking about what I'm goin g to write for the next ass. well twenty mins is up now, so goodbye. "
Tell me about yourself.,"It seems weird that Linda is in the same philosophy class as me since we both live in the same neighborhood back in Houston, even though we have never really met each tother before. She says she is planning to bvisit houston quite often, but I don;t think I will as often as her. Its not because I don't want to go home, but its partly that I feel independent here even though not monetarily. Also, I would like to get the chance to vistit austin and get to know m y surrounding before going back to the norm and comfortableness of my true home; austin is my new temporary home. Mike said he missed home the very first day; I don;t think I really miss home that much, maybe because of the contradictory or hyppocritical views I sometimes have of things in houston. I wonder if my schedule conflict involving ba101 will be settled with out further conflict; I can't afford to miss psychology atfor ba101 once a month, yet I cannot afford to lose sight of ba101. Hopefully, this Dan or brian character will be able to sufficinetly change my course schedule since tex won't allow me to do it any more. It seems that I got a lot to do today, yet at the moment it doens't seem as anything is concrete, expect some homework arbitrarily. Its only been 5 minutes and its seems as though I have been typing at leat twice that long. I wonder how my mind will wonder to the next stream of unconsciousness. Philosophy seems to be an interesting class even though the reading is quite strenuous. Socrates must have been the master at breaking people's arguments; he would have been a great attorney or lawyer. Which reminds me, what exactly is the difference between a lawyer and an attorney? Perhaps its in how they represent people or their specific type or level of education concerning the law. The damn ethernet guy better at least give me a ring and try to help me fix the connection that was working until last thursday or so, I have called and left a message three times already and no response. Does he live in Dobie or just has a similar prefix to his phone #. Once I get the ethernet working, I won't have to come here to this computer lab and worrying abut forgetting to tyupe in my IF account #. Almost all the peoplke I have talked ot about this labor day weekend have said they will be travelling back to home; most of my friends are those from my high school, we probably are at least 55 people representing cy falls. I would like to play a pick up game with Gabe and see how much he has improved since the days he was with theh cypress falls basketball program. I bet jimmy is trying to get accustomed to his new surroundings at that junior college, which I can't recall the name to. Mike's sister basically got the dusch from that jeff punk, I don';t think I would have confessed seeing another woman unless she was going to find out regardless; better from me than from a stranger. Unlike the infamous Zoi situation, Only five more minutes until I can check my mail; hopefully, somebody that is not attending UT will have written me to see how everything is going or the Panhellenic council will have finally decided to start their opening meeting. How many Greeks, true Greeks/ Hellenas , not fraternity or soririty people, are amognst me at UT. Maybe I will meet some good looking girls. I knew it was Candice as soon as I saw at the BIC meeting; haven't seen her since the days at TGHP. ITs weird that she knows Amber, the girl I kind of hooked up with at one fo the Turkeyballs in 95, so long ago. Its alomsst time and I just read the click once to submit  button while awaiting the time to log off this thing. Only a few more minutes ; my wrist are beginning to sweat opn this uncomfortable keyboard. I keep wanting to type with my left ring finger because it feels liek it needs to be streched or so. Time. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Hello. My name is Neha Shah, and I'm a freshman this year. So far I love ut and I'm not at all scared of anything here yet. classes are great, and I actually enjoy most of my professors. they keep the class interesting. the only thing I really fear is that I will slack off. I am great at doing my work, and I know that I will get the job done, but when it comes to reading assigned chapters, I have a history of not doing it. that's my greatest fear. most people fear they won't find friends, or will get homesick, but amazingly enough, I'm not homesick at all. I'm actually doing very well here. I met many people at orientation this summer and it turns out that I've come close to two of the people that I met. one of which I am with usually everyday. and friends from home also keep me strong. high school was great and my senior year was so memorable to me. I finally gained the confidence in myself and I gained so much to my self esteem. On a normal, day to day basis, I try to keep an optimistic approach to everything as it comes to me in obstacles. this way of thinking has allowed me to get through hard times, whenever I'm feeling down. My friends and  family have also contributed to that. they are so close to me. my younger brother is someone I love and despise at the same time. he's probably the only person on earth that knows how to make me so angry without saying more than a couple of words. he's a genius. he just doesn't seem to know it. he loves to be different, which isn't exactly the best way to do things. (especially when it comes to my parents). he's not bad at all, just likes to argue his point, even though he knows he's wrong. he's always there to help me out when I have a problem, and I know that. He's very strong too. he never shows what he's really feeling. for example, when I left to college, he acted as if it were no big deal. well, in the last week, I've recieved about 4 or more emails from him. he does care, just doens't know how to show it. my parents are also so great. I'm somewhat conservative and that is due to their parenting. the way they raised me is the best gift they could've given to me. they did an awesome job. I am so proud of being indian, and I'm also very proud to be part of the family that I'm in. I wouldn't change that at all. I grew up in a city that really isn't that small, but to me and my friends. I like growing up there, but I really wanted to get out of there to move on. in a way I'm still home because of the people that surround me and email also lets me talk to everyone I need to, but austin itself is a lively town and something I really wanted. I wanted to move to a big school, where you could meet a diverse crowd, and start over. I had a startover point my freshman year in high school, and now once again in college. I love it. I like to meet new people, because there's so much you can talk about. also, I love the effect of something unknown. in this case, austin is a new adventure to me. when I went to new york city a couple of years ago, all I wanted to do was walk around times square and the surrounding area just to experience the rush and energy. even though danger may come of it, I like to live life like that. doing things I by myself is also something that has been in me all my life. I've always been independent and I'm fairly sure that's becuase I take after my dad (who moved to the us and started a family here), and because I'm the older child. I like doing things on my own, so then I know if I make a mistake, I can fix it. I don't like depending on others all the time, but I love being with people. I know those are two contradicting statements but I do have those that I rely on, and I do consider connections when I need to. it's my word for people you know to get things you need done. overall, I love my life. I can't ask for a better one. the ups and downs just add to it, and I want to live it to the fulliest. coming here was a good decision on my part and I hope to succeed with great pride. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Today was a very long and exhausting day. I began by waking up at 8:15, after only 6 hours of sleep, to go to a 9:00 Art History discussion lab at the museum. It actually crossed my mind to skip class and then go back to sleep, that way I wouldn't be as tired as I am right now. But instead I decided to go ahead and go to class, otherwise I would just fall behind and not know what happend. Personaly, I am not one to really like getting behind, so I think that I made the right decision, granted I may be tired right now, I know my decision to go to class will pay off in the long run. As my day continued, I went to the actual class lecture for  Art history. It was somewhat interesting, although I found it a little difficult to consentrate. I guess that may be because I did not catch up on my reading that I was supposed to have completed by today. Obviously I am paying for the ocnsequenses of not keeping up with the outside responsibilities. Futhur in the day, I went to the dentist to get a filling,  which was not fun!  The right side of my mouth was numb for about 4 hours. That may not sound like too long, but in reality, when your mouth is numb and you can't talk well, and you can't eat or drink anything because you will spill it, it is a long time. Then I proceeded to go to a meeting. I had previously told my room mate that she was able to use my computer while I was gone. This kind of bothered me just because I payed for this computer and I could have just relied on her supplying the computer and used hers. I just don't really think that that is fair. Then what really irritated me, which doesn't happen too ofter, is that when I came back from the meeting, the stuff that was in my chair that she sat in was thrown all on the floor. My brand new shirts that are not even two days old, my purse, and my shorts, were all on the ground. Now it is one hting to use something of someones and put everything back where you found it, but to be so inconsiderate as to not put things back in it's place is rude. I was quite mad, so instead of confronting her, I just left and went to get TCBY and to watch tv with my sister. I guess you could say that I did it to get out of confronting her and to also blow some steem off. Oh well, what's done is done, but next time I think that I just might have to say something to her(if I let her use my computer next time). Well, that was pretty much my day, and now I am just trying to get caught up with all of my responsibilities and homework, which is making me stressful. I know that I will be relieved when I finish it all, though. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I need to get to my dorm soon so I can get ready to work out that place was so crowded yesterday, there wasn't hardly any machines open, maybe today since it's a different time the machines will be open with more of a selection. I hope they are serving something good for dinner, I didn't like those spicy chicken nuggets for lunch, I'm starting to get hungry now, but I know you shouldn't eat before you work out. I wonder if anyone will actually read this, they must see some weird things when going through all of these. This seems like it will be a fun and interesting class, but my geology class is going to be difficult for me. I never have liked science classes. Chemistry was the worst class I took in high school. I'm glad I'm not in high school anymore, but I'm not exactly thrilled about being here either, I thought it would be tons of fun, but it hasn't been the greatest yet, I guess I neeed to give it more time to see if I'll find more friends, all the girls in my dorm seem to be really nice, maybe I can become good friends with them, but then I think about my friend back home and the close relationships I had, I think that I'll never friend any more friends that close, but I guess I needd to give it more time, I haven't even been here a week yet. I wonder if classes will get harder next week, I'm scared I'll have too much work to do. I hope all the work I have to do on the computer can get done, hopefully the labs won't get too full. I wonder why they haven't opened the lab in my dorm yet It seems like they would when school starts, but they are waiting until monday. They should know the professors assign work the first day, I wish the computer in my room would hook up to the internet but I know It's probably too old to connect with the ethrocard, and even if I got that I know it would be so slow, just like it was when it was connected at my house. At least it's there if I ever need to type an essay or any kind of paper. But, may be at christmas I can get a new computer. Christmas seems so far away, but I bet once school gets going the time will fly by. It'll be nice to have almost a whole month for Christmas break. Wow I've written a lot. I didn't think I would think of anything to write about. But I just let my thoughts flow and look how much I've jumped aroud I went to about 5 different subjects. And now my time is almost up. I'm kind of worried the assignment for some reason won't get to you, like it will get lost on the internet or something, I don't trust computers all that much I would feel better If I turned it in personally but hopefully it gets there. Yeah times up see you in class!!! "
Tell me about yourself.,"The first thought that enters my mind is that I have no idea what I am going to say in this assignment. I have no thoughts or feelings except that I am trying to think about what to say. These types of assignments are difficult for me because I usually concentrate on a concrete task, not writing down random thoughts. Because I am a guy, sex just popped into my head. Because I am male, I hope I do not have to write down everytime this happens in the next nineteen minutes. For the next nineteen minutes, the only feelings I will have are those of confustion and befuddlement, for lack of anything to say. This being my first college writing assignment, I am a little nervous that I may be doing this wrong. I must change my previous statement that I am confused. It is more of a fear that I will do this assignment wrong and not receive credit for it. My next thought was to look at the clock and see how much time I had left. Only fourteen minutes left. Yahoo.   I just wondered if there was going to be a volleyball game at the gym tomorrow. It is not that I like volleyball, but that it takes away the gym at Gregory for playing basketball, which is my favorite thing to do on weeknights. (eleven minutes left. I can't wait). I just glanced back at the prompt and realized that it is impossible to not think about grammar, spelling, and sentence structure. This is not a warning usually associated with a writing assignment, and therefore it will probably be focused on more because of it. I just saw an empty Dr. Pepper can in the garbage can and I thought I might like one, but then I realized that I wanted to finish this assignment before getting one. My next thought was that I wish I had a thesaurus right now because I have used the word ""assignment"" too many times. Excuse me, someone just knocked on the door. It was one of my roommate's friends who scares me because I believe he might go ""postal"" at anytime. I had a thought before this person came to the door, but I forgot it now. It's okay because I only have to write for seven more minutes. I am wondering what my ""Quote of the Day"" will be on my board outside my dorm. I want to use a quote from the movie ""What About Bob"" but I'm afraid it will be too long to fit on the board. Again, I am having the problem of not knowing what to say. It must stem from my lack of self-esteem. I just glanced at the clock and found that I only have to write for two more minutes. I just realized that I should not have written that down because I could have stopped then and you wouldn't have known but now you will expect at least a few more sentences. If this ""assignment"" was supposed to show me how my mind works, I am not pleased with the results. It shows me that my mind does not work that well at all. My only ""sensation"" in the last twenty minutes is that I have to go to the bathroom     "
Tell me about yourself.,"I don't know why I got to do this assignment. I am feeling kinda hungry now. I wish iwere in dallas now with my friends . I like the shoes that guy is wearing. I need to call up my friend today. mann this assignment is boring. hope the professor does'nt fail me for reading this. I wonder what's for lunch today. I wish time would pass by fast and friday would come soon. Some people in the library look really old. I wish I were tall like the guy walking there. I think my watch is faster than the watch here. I need fill out a petition form for credit like the person beside me after I get done with this assignment. is drinking really necessary to be cool. I have thirteen minutes remaining. I wish my girlfriend were here. I think I should find another girlfriend. umm maybe not I donno I'm confused. why is that guy there staring this way ? what am I supposed to do today ? math is done I guess I'll finish economics once I'm done with this pointless assignment. Nine minutes left and I hate typing cause I am not fast like other pepole but's it's okay I guess. how do pepole study soo much ? I should try out the bus service here sometime. i got 5 minutes left and my mind isnow thinking of what to think . is'nt that confusing. it is soo quiet in here. I am bored but I got to finish this assignment. that girl looks finee , ooh well I should not be distracted or cheat on my girlfriend. mann there are many indian students in this university, never seen soo many indian students ever. should I juss submit it although I have 2 mins left  I guess I'll just sit till 2 mins pass by ooh well a in left and I got to finish the petition form . I feel so stupid writing my thoughts on a computer for someone to read this is crazy . I can't believe that I think all this stuff all the time but I bet it would feel stupid to read it. ooh yeah twenty mins are up I hope these thoughts are enough for a grade, hope I make a good score, I have to keep up a high gpa or else my parents will be disappointed ok thoughts bye for now  "
Tell me about yourself.,I really miss my family. School here is fast paced and big. Ice cream was good tonight. Wish I could see G. J. I love him he's so cool and fun to be with. I wish Justin would call me why hasn't he called yet?  I wish that I\I had my old bed here with me now I want to have fun I think that I am really tired right now. I need sleep I should be sleeping not typing it's hard to clear your mind because there are so many things to think about how's Sarah doing?  I miss her she's so cute I wish I could pick her up and hug her right now. I wish that I weren't in schhol again already. I love the eagles. I'm just running down the road trying to loosen my load got seven women on my mind. what I don't have any women on my mind I guess my mom well I like my screen saver a lot. The elephant sounds and the frog is really cute. I need to eat more regularly. ever since I got here I haven't been eating enough. Am I homesick?  Is it too hard to keep in contact with people here?  yes it is. Too many people. I wanted a big school but I don't think I knew what I was getting into. I just want to be successful  I wan't to meet people and to make lasting and important relationships I want to get married I wish I could sleep and think and not have to stay up doing random assignments that will hav no effect on my life whatsoever. I know that college is worth the trouble but sometimes I wish I didn't have to be here-I didn't have to grow up. I know that everything will work out why has G. J. been treating me like he has I am just an old flame am I boring to him now?  why did last night he say that he was tired and wanted to sleep but then when his friend called he was ready to do something  why does he always have to be so selfish I always do things for othewr people and I w\usually think about him and what he would want constantly am I getting taken advantage of I am sore I have been working out a lot lately. I need to go run and clear my thoughts I wish my bed were here. I hate the new bed. I can't ever sleep. My first monday is tomorrow and I'm not excited about it. whhy/  coffee would be good now I'm a caffeine addict. I love it just like I love gj just like I wish he were here right now. what am I going to do for the rest of the night/ why hasn't jenny called me where are all of my friends?  I miss juli. she's a really good friend. Anthony is too why didn't I go canoeing with him yestereday?  should have why do I never want to talk to him anymore do I think that he wants me more than I would like. I still have 7 minutes left. just looked at the clck I hope that's allowed. maybe not but probably is okay because I really was wondering how much time I have left Danny said that he already did his assignment he's a nerd though no wonder he can't get girls to fulfill his needs anthony just called he said he only made 50 bucks but he just rode around on a kayk all day. church was cool anthony should have come witrh me.

I wonder if I'm going to run out of meals my roommate is on the desk right now she's pretty wierd I've known her since fourth grade and she still seems wierd to me oh well maybe she always will. I wish justrin would call. why wont he? probably has a girlfriend. Like I have a boyfriend that's been treating me like shit that's always nice- love that hate guys sometimes well I have about two or three minutes left. Gosh roommmate is inging now what the hell is felicia singing/  She can't sing. I can sing better than she can. I hope you appreciate reading this if you ever do because it is emotionally straining at this time of night for me to write all of this. Hmm. my 20 minutes is over How time flies when life's a bitch 
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm really worried about shannon I wonder if shes going to be ok it scares me a lot. I'm never known anyone my age to have something serious like that. I wonder if it was cause by anything like a cell phone or living by a tower or whatever. it makes me wonder if that could happen to me. I'm not sure why people smoke. its such a disgusting habit, but people seem to do it because it looks cool and because other people are doing it. I could understand why people smoked in high school it made you bad or something but not it just hurts your health and makes you ugly. I need to go brush my teeth. I wonder what reid is doing. he is so hot, I really would like to get with him, and I'm starting to lose intrest in chris. I feel trapped by him. I love being able to call on him whenever I want to do something. he's sort of my conveinent boyfriend. I guess that's not fair to him, but I'd almost rather it just be this way. I have a voice mail. who could that be from. I wonder when they will fix my phone. I love talking on the phone. I miss my mom. I don't miss my dad. I wonder how to tell him not to come home for parents weekend. I hate him. he'll maake me fell miserable either way. they are coming to fix my phone. thank god. I wonder if my date tonight will be cute. I like that outfit I wore last night. I really love suzanne and kristin and kleigh. suzanne is so awesome, but I wish we were all in the same sorority. actually no I don't. this way we have 3 close friends from different sororities and I have becoem good friends with megan joanie and tara. tara's awesome. I love all my sisters. I wonder what will happen when christy comes in town. I hope her and brian break up so I can set him up with someone. he's a good guy she doesn't deserve him. I think they're relationship is completely sexual. I wonder if I'll ever get married. I wonder if my dad will ruin that day for me too. I wonder if my mom will get married. I am embarassed of my parents sometmes. that makes me feel like such a bad person, but I can't help it. I love my mom. I wonder if anything bad will happen to brian because of those shirts he stole. I think that is so wrong. mike plays guitar. I wish I palyed guitar. acoustic not electric. I'd like to be able to play brown eyed girl. I wonder if I could be on staff for asp. I wonder if I could be a camp texas counselor. that counsleor that made me ""hiney write"" was awesome. he was a cool guy. doug is awful. I hope I never get played. I wonder if I'm playing chris. I would feel better if he would date someone else. god I wonder where reid is right now. he has no friday classes. my suitemates phone is ringing. are they up. do tehy have class. will she ever stop drinking?  I hope she learns to slow down. she's an alcoholic. that guy was not even cute. I should talk to her. kathryn is cool. I want kathryn to amke a painting for me. I like fruit loops. yum. are we out of milK?  damn I have to buy cheese. I want a quesdilla. why did that boy stop by at2?  what an idiot. I'm probably more likely to help him. I like the body builder next door. he likes me too. I wonder if angie chappel and kyle talked about me. she seemed to be very curious about chris being my boyfriend or not. I feel like a bitch when I think this, but I wish kyle would shave his go-t. who arranged the keyboard?  why are they in this order. I think its easier to have it this way then in alphabetical order. you use the letters asdf allot. and jkl. and ert. I wonder if sesame street is on. I liked bert and ernie. there was an episode of my so called life where rayanne sang how to get to sesame street. it was awesome. I hate that girl from the tri-delt house. I don't' know why they don't like me. I wonder what to wear tonight. damn it I need to study. has it been 20 minuts. how come I don't have any hot professors?  I like ut. I don't want to drink anymore. am I going to get fat?  kleigh is cute. I wish I had her figure. some people are lucky. I love my bed. its so soft. its lunchtime I'm not hungry. I wish I were skinny like andrea. I wonder if wolfe likes me. I think I scared him last night with my story about the elevator. why do the elevatros ehre take so long. I can't believe what happened to me and chris in the elevator. that was so emabarssing, and yet I can smile/laugh at it. chris is cool. i have a lecutre to go to today. I have to read. I have to work out. I have to call whats his anem and tell him I can't go. I don't think kleigh will go. what to do. "
Tell me about yourself.,"There is a girl named amy who annoys me very much. We used to be very good friends until I found her true personality. Amy;s personality is hard to relate to which makes her hard to get along with. She only does things that help her or make her look better. For example, she will only become friends with people who benifit her or make her look cool. Amy requires shopping. She shops at least once a week. Her shopping habbits drive me insane. Amy cares so much about how she appears to other that it hides her true personality. She acts like the person she wants to be but will never become. Amy is a smart girl but that is not obvious in a conversation. She acts oblivious to the current events and common knowledge.  Being at college and having a girlfriend at home is a hard task to handle. Eventhough it is tough to do, it sounds a lot worse than it actually is. While I do not see my girlfriend half as much as I am used to, I can still call her everyday. While phone conversations are not physicall confromtations, they do help in easing the pain of not having her around all the time. By being apart for extended periods of time, when I do end up going home to visit, the benefits are rewarding. The time spent together then is more special than any other time I have spent with her before. Because we both know our time is limited, we seem closer during my home visits. It is some of the only times when we think on the same level. Both of our plans include us spending time together. Eventhough I would much rather be at home with her, I am glad we made the choice to stay together while I am at college. Next year I can only hope that she decides to attend UT. It would ease a difficult stage in our relationship. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am so happy to be home right now. College life is fun and all, but I miss the comforts of home. At the dorm, there is always something ""extremely important"" to do at every moment. Someone is always dropping by and visiting or calling on the phone. I have sorority events to go to or a date, or something. I am getting so overwhelmed by it all. I suddenly have so many responsibilities. Like making sure I wake up for class on time, washing my dishes, making sure I eat enough meals, try to fit in studying every once in a while, follow all of my sorority rules at all times. And my current boy situation is so overwhelming. Suddenly, no that I am single, there seem to be an overabundance of guys. They are everywhere and are always giving out their phone numbers. It is so weird to not have a boyfriend since Brandon and I were together for 14 months. To make that situation worse, he is still so present in my life. Our break up was just one of the many major changes in my life with the beginning f college. I know that lots of girls feel the need to ""find themselves"" once in college, and it seemed so bizarre to me before I actually was in their shoes. I mean, don't you know who you are? I thought that I did, but now that everything is so different, I feel very lost and confused about who I am and what types of values/morals I have. Up to this point, every decision I made was affected to some degree by my parents. For example, my 1 a. m. curfew had an extreme affect onm where I went at night, how much sleep I got each night. Also, there were rules on who I went out with, because my parents had to meet them beforehand. Now, I can come and go as I please with no questions asked. I'm not so sure that is a good thing. I mean, just because I am 18, that does not mean I suddenly competent to run my entire life. I miss being able to come home everyday and tell my mom all of my daily triumphs and failures. Although, I think that mom and I talk more now than when I lived at home (not that home is far away, only twenty minutes. We talk almost five times a day. But it is different than having here tuck me in each night and hug me when I am down. What is also so diffucult now is that when I need someone to talk to, all of closest friends are thousands of miles away at their own universities. So, I am left with trying to reveal my emotions to practical strangers that I have formed some sort of bond with. Friendships are difficult and delicat things. I know that everyone is looking for a friend right now, especcially me, and yet true friendships don't just form overnight. They take months to form a feeling of trust and compassion between two people. You cannot just jump in and say ""Oh we are best friends now. "" That is why soroity life is so strange now. I have been thrown into this new ""family"" in which we are all supposed to be friends, and yet I don't even know most of their names. I guess that over time, we will get close, but right now, it is akward. However, I am thankful to have somewhere to go when I get lonely. Which is quiet often now that all of friends are gone. "
Tell me about yourself.,the tv in here is always too loud. I know I shouldnt watch it while I study but its kind of hard with people in and out all the time anyway. and the fan is always too cold. but thats ok because I just ran all the way over here since I thought that I had missed the deadline for this. that really scared me. I have been slacking off way more than  I should. I hate the way on awards shows try to kick people off stage subtley with light music or commercials. its just kind of rude. I don't know why they make such a big deal about the emmys anyway. tv is not good. rots the brain. I think computers do it much more. I always have headaches after staring at a screen for a while. my head hurts already. I am so glad this is going to be in on time. and I'm missing a bit of study hall anyway and that is good. I love kevin costner. too bad hes getting a little old. and he did that movie post man. this week is going to be harder than the  first two. I think. I need to go to those si sessions. my shoulders itch and I really need to figure out what I'm going to do this weekend. I need to just make a decision and stick to it for once. I really need a haircut this week. I am a little on the shaggy side. there are certain things that I do miss about home now that I'm actually gone. I'm not the type to get homesick but I at least knew my way around for simple things like haircuts. and I had options. here I am pretty much stuck with whatever is closest. this assignment is going on forever. I think I was a little worried that it was late. so I got a little excited when it came to typing. thank god lindsey was wrong. I love the show friends. but I quit falling for all those reatarded teen shows. can't stand them. hopefully I can fill up the space before I run out of time. or things to say. atleast my computer is finally working. I fell dumb that I couldnt set it up myself. I'm better off than my roommate though. she had never sent an email before saturday. pretty lame if you ask me. crap I forgot to call that guy about the football tickets. I would be so excited if I got to go to dallas on friday. I miss those people. not the alchoholism though. this better not delete or crash right now. would be too typical . not really. this is like writing a big letter or email. but this is a lot more boring because instead of actually talking to a person who has any idea of who I am or what I'm like  I'm just talking to myself. I'm actually talking to a computer screen which is even sadder. but no one is going to be reading this so I guess it doesn't matter. as long as  I turn this in. I'm so bored right now and all I can think about is that I have to do another one. not good. blah blah blah. I think I'm done. 
Tell me about yourself.,"Far too many thoughts are running through my head right now. Too many things changing all around me. My main concerm=n is Matt. I know it is crazy for me to think that the two of us can stay together through the year but I want to so badly. he is my best friend and there is no way I can just let myself lose him. I am just so worried about everything. we are fighting an awful lot lately vecause we need to learn to get adjusted to all the new things around us. why in the world is he at Rolla. He just settled there which makes me so diappointed because I want him to be happy. Not just settling someweher cause he feels like he has no other choices. And then he goes on about there not being anyone there who doesn't drink and so in order to not be alone he hads to go out with these guys  why can't he just gove it some time. He'll meet good people eventually. he just doesn't want to be alone like he was for most of high school. I can kind of understand because  he spent so much time out of hat he considered the loop. I can't really say much because all my other friends are at UT. Heck I'm even living with one of my best friends. I knew that would be a mistake but I just didn't have t eheart to turn her down so I siad we could be suitemates, not roommates. still a mistake. She is always in my business, never a moments peace. It doesn't help that she keeps aksing about matt. The sick part is that she has always liked hikm. he used to like her which makes it even worse. And she keeps trying to stay in contact with him which pisses me off. I know I can't tell him he can't talk with her but it seriuosly upsets me. especially cause she keeps busting in here asking me all kinds of questions about us. She doesn't know how much of a private person I am about certain things. If I want to talk I will share anythign under the sun. but I hate beign pressured to talk and I hate not having my space. She doesn't understand. I am a hard person to live with because I am so picky about everything. I like things my way. so livign with others is often hard. My roommmate and I get along great cause we give each other space while always being there for each other when we need it. It neat cause we hadn't met unitl last week and yet we already work on much the same level. So the whole lindsay thing just adds to the mess with Matt. I am very insecure about him going away. really scared about the whole situation so it doesn;t help when I feel my best friend is after my man. I know he has nothing to do with it but why couldn't he just ignore her for me, for us. I know it is not good for us to fight like this and I don't want to but sometimes I just start expected too much. Ridiculous things that no one can be expected to live up to. but that's the way I am, I figure if I can do it others should be able to too. On that I amn very wrong but it still bothers me. I want my baby to be happy and I don't want us to trap each other in a relationship that isn't healthy but I'm not ready to let go. I still think that if we just get settled it will all work itself out. I just can't have Lindsay behind me all the time interupting our conversations. I just feel that he always has to go before we can really finish somehting. And then there are my parenst who are so weird. now that I am gone they try and contact me more. They I'm and email but never call. then they blame nme, why haven't you called. well first of all yall are tryign to see me more than you did while I was home, secondly, wy don't you call. That drives me crazy. I really don't miss anyone except matt. That isn't really suprising to me though because I have never been one to miss my family . And most of my really close friends are here. Which is interesting in itself. UT is the last place I ever thought I would end up. I always wanted to go to Rice and then on the last day I suddenly changed my mind. Not sure all the reasons why. sometimes I say it is because UT had the program I wanted, at Rice I really didn't have a major. But other times I think I was just too chicken. Too chicken to pick the harder school. I knew I could handle it but I didn't know if I wanted too. Then there were my parenst who for some reason pushed UT. Not gform the beginning, but somewhere along the line, I think when my dad saw the scholarship. Then he went form die hard Rice to, ""I think you'd be better off at UT. ""  I didn't want to do the same things my friends were doing. I wanted something new. And heere I am with one of my friends in the same room. now that is a stretch. My best friend other than matt is Andrea and who knew but she pulle done of the same things and ended up at UT too. So really there is no one to miss except my baby and iZ am takign that really hard. It's hard to believe  I acn't see him until Christmas. And talkign over the internet just isn't the same. I just want everything to settle down and my emotions to caslm down so that I am not so fickle with everything and don't act irrationally. I never mean to hurt him but judt today Irealized that I have been. Now as I talk it sounds like we shouldn't stay together but we have sommmuch fun tigether and I think that this is justa phase. we are both stressed. I hope my roommates don't get all weird on me and start thinkign I'm getting depressed. I really just need some space and a little time to adjust. "

Tell me about yourself.,"I don't know where to start. My mind is full right now with all sorts of thoughts and feelings. UT is great but I am not sure where I fit into things right now. It is really just one big cycle for the time being. When I was driving here from Arlington, my dad told me that I would not hang out with any of the people I already knew because you will ""drift apart. ""  But I like my friends. I have two friends that are going to join a fraternity. I also have two friends who are not going to join a fraternity. The three of us have been going to some of the parties, trying to see if that is the route we want to go. For me, this has been a huge thing on my mind. Constantly. I want to fit in somewhere, but I am not sure I want to pay for it. It really is strange. All this thinking about social life leaves less time for study. Speaking of study, I have nothing to do but read. No busy work. Just reading. That kind of reading will fry your brain. This has been a weird week. Everything has changed. School, friends, family (or lack of). It is kind of cool, though. I am just kind of hoping that a routine starts here. It is really hard to keep learning a new schedule day in and day out. I simply want it to be easy. I guess that is what college is for. It teaches you to grow up. Now I have laundry to do. Just another fun thing to do. It really sounds negative, but my life is good, I guess. Just finished that 32 page questionnaire. While most of it was simple, it really does make you think. Especially when it asks, ""Are you certain about your answers?""  Who knows?  Do you like yourself? Of course. Are you sure?  Yep. I guess it would really suck though if you were thinking about killing yourself all the time. That never crosses my mind. It is too much fun to live. Challenging experiences though. Sure wish UT would have won yesterday. It was great yesterday. Went to a party, then to the game, then we lost. That just kind of ruins the whole effect. Back to the frat thing. We were supposed to go to party for the Sigma Chi's after the game. I really wonder if they try to be your best friend so you will join. Most of the guys are cool. But I think I am going to wait. They all say it is best to join 1st semester, but that is what ""they"" say. I believe my decision to wait should be respected, and if it isn't, then they aren't that cool anyway. I guess. I think I just need to meet more girls. That would make life much more enjoyable. That has got to be the answer. I have moved twice in my life and have always managed to meet people quickly. But at that point, I never knew the difference. Now it is hard. I think it is because of insecurity. I am really not afraid to admit it. I am insecure in meeting girls, but I will have to grow out of it. For now, I just wish I didnt have to read so much. It isn't that bad, just boring. You cannot retain 40 pages of economics in one day. It is just not possible. But I guess I will try my best. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now I am thinking about what all my friends are doing. I just finished emailing them for the first time since I figured out how to do email in the computer lab. Its wierd being away from home. But I've decided I fel only as if I am away to cheerleading camp and its just a little longer that it normally is. I am loving college life so far. I feel like I've been managing my time fairly well, but I get annoying constantly when I feel somewhat disorganizee. There is a lot to remember and things that I guess we are supposed to know as freshamn that I have no clue about. I just joined a sorority and I am stating to realize how time- demanding it is. But my grades are far more important to me. I am nervous about my classes because in high school I was used to A's (except in chemistry). I am hopefully going to tranfer from engineering to business possible business honors if I do well enough so I want to do really well. I have been doing my readings, but I was never the best test taker. I am not used to the big classes, and tey make me uncomfortable thats why I would love to be in an honors program where the classes are smaller. I am the type of student who likes to have a perwsonal relationship with my teachers, and I don't feel like I can approach them in such a large setting. People who know me find this to be odd because I am nortmally quite outgoing no matter the situation. Today during class, we talked about how a majority of first year students go through depression. I think I've been trying to avoid it by keeping very busy, but I guess I somewhat am. I miss my family and my best friend vera at southwest. I even miss my teachers aned my old high school. AT my high school everyone knew who I was and rspected me, or looked up to me in a way. I was a cheerleader, and the top of my class. Here I'm just a number. But I'm the type of person who likes challenges, so I don't think its depression. I just look at this experience as another challenge to face in order to achieve success at a higher level. My classes and teachers are all really good- which I expected since I spent a majority of orientation researching them. I just hope I have success in all my classes. I would really love to go home at Christmas with  a 4. 0 which I don't think is completely unreasonable. A lot of people are counting on me to do well, my parents, my family (7 younger brothers and sisters), my extended family. Its almost stressful. There is so much to do hre in Austin. It is fun but I will need to prioritize Sun-Thur. Its wierd not having anyways to tell you what to do, or when to do it. But its also nice to not have the responsibility of 9 other family memebers. I always had to make sure I didnt need t6o help my parents with  driving, babysitting, or house work before I got to do any of my own things. They definelty relied on me less second semester which was really cool of them. I have much more free time then last year too because I ony have to worry about myself (that sounds selfish) but I don't need to check up on 9 other peoples lives before I take care of my own business. Of coure, I still make it my business to know what they are doing because our family life was gret. There are so many personalities. We are all so unique, and it was definetly a challenge learning how to cope and adapt to each one. I think my parents are stil having fun doing it- I bet theyre glad to have gotten rid of one- but at the same time they miss me - I know. I think I have the best parents ever. They love me so much!!!!   "
Tell me about yourself.,"I can't make up my mind if I want to go to a meeting with Charles or not. He asked me to go, but I kind of don't want to go. I have a math quiz in the morning and I need to go over the problems. Anyway. i haven't heard from Tony in a while. I hate it when guys tell me that they are goingto call and they don't. Tony was acting strange towards me at the ACC meeting yesterday. O well, I hope he dosen't want a relationship with me. I cannot handle one right now. I don't understand why I always I have to speak to people before they speak to me. I know they see me coming. I'm not going to worry about that though. I wonder if I should participate in the Miss Black and Gold Pageant. I really don't see myself as the type of lady that enters those kinds of things. First of all, I don't have a talent. Second of all, I'm not good at answering questions right off the top of my head. I have four years until I can do it, so I might just wait. If Cookie does it, then I will. I'm kind of excited about going home on the 17th. It's the Homecoming Ceremonies that night. I'll get to see my recent ex-boyfriend. I can't believe that he still tells people that we are still going together. He has a lot of nerve. Anyway. it hasn't even been ten minutes and I'm already tired of typing. Psychology is confusing to me. So is Philosophy and Biology. I don't know what to believe in now. I was brought up as a Christian, but now I realize that science proves some things in the bible to be wrong. I still don't know what came first, the dinosaurs or man. Anyway, I'm not going to worry about that either. There are so many guys here that are attractive, but the bad part about it is that they know they are attractive. Guys around here seem to stereotype the freshman girls as ""easy, silly and stuck-up"". I have to admit, a lot of my classmates are stuck-up, but I don't think they are silly. Once again, I don't understand why I always have to be the one to speak to everyone first. It's mostly the girls who have to be spoken to. Soem of the guys are like that too. I like the college life so far. My parents used to never let me do anything. They were so strict on me. Now, I go out whenever I want to, but I'm not going cray with it. They thought that I would go wild when I got to college, but I haven't. I'm mature enough for college. My brother on the other hand wasn't. He went to college for a day and quit. He was so worried about getting money, that he quit scholl to get a job. He needs that job too because his ex-girlfriend is going to hit him up on child support. My paremts tried to warn him, but he was hard-headed. "
Tell me about yourself.,"WOW!  Time goes by fast. Here I am doing my college homework and it seems as  though just the other day I was at recess or eating from my lunchbox in  elementary school or going through the trials of junior high or thinking you  know everything in high school to realizing you don't know everything in  college. Time flies and friends come and go. I have met so many people since I  have been at this enormous school. I have come to realize that you must take  initiative in order to succeed. For instance, I am currently majoring in  theatre, but I don't know if that's what I really want to do with my life. If I  don't get out there to take initiative to try out and see how far I can go, I  will never figure out if theatre is the way I want to go or not. Then there's  the question of what I'd do if I didn't major in theatre. I know that I  wouldn't do anything with computers because this is the 3rd time I've had to  write this since I have had many computer troubles. I accidently erased the  first one and my friend's computer froze when I was writing the other one. I am  using my friend Robert's computer because mine won't connect to the internet. Right now I'm sitting in a room with some of my new friends from UT, and they're  talking about Ross's hair. Some of the girls want to cut his hair, but he  doesn't want his hair cut. They think it looks like an 80s haircut but he begs  to differ. Anyway, back to the other thoughts of the past, present, and future. I just remembered that I have a blueberry muffin sitting on the shelf in my  room. I hope it's not stale. Maybe I can drink it with my over-do milk. It's  past the drinking date. This gum is very stale and I am getting hungry. If I  were in my room, I would eat my muffin or the chips that I didn't eat last week  because I had to get to class. You see, I feed the birds my second sandwich  because I'm full. Then I still have chips left over. Oh, well. The joys of  wednesday sack lunches from Towers. I'm used to sack lunches because I've eaten  a sack lunch every day in high school. The reason is that we eat in the  greenroom and it's hard to get your tray into the greenroom. Some of my friends  have done it, but then they put the trays up above the ceiling and the teachers  get mad. Ah, the good old days. Robert and Ross and Kristi want to order a  pizza. That sounds like a good idea. It's late and I have to get up early for  my intro to media class tomorrow. College is a time when it seems hard to get  any sleep. There's always something you've got to do, or just good old  fashioned procrastination. I mean, I don't procrastinate. This isn't even due  for another week or so, and here I am, already typing it for the 3rd time. Adam  Sandler is on TV right now. I just learned that his CDs have a parental  advisory due to explicit content. Isn't that interesting. Funny how society  tries to censor our lives when in reality children are the currupt ones these  days. Like my friends. they're crazy. Children are exposed to so much, like  from TV. I never had cable growing up, so I don't know what it's like. We did  have channel 13, KERA. That was nice. Now, we're listening to the Doors, which  reminds of A Midsummer Night's Dream because my high school did it in the 60's  and that was the music we used. Well, at least, we used some Doors music. We  used great 60s music. Then I was in A Midsummer Night's Dream in the 90s, and  we used original music written by one of the cast members. He wrote the tune  for The Wiz, and tranfered the words because of course Shakespeare didn't write  like the music in The Wiz. Robert just called a guy because his number was on a  dollar bill. He's crazy, but that is what makes life fun. Then there's Ross  with his mushroom haircut and Kelly, who some say looks like Tom Cruise, but in  reality, he looks nothing like Tom Cruise. No more than the pizza guy, who  looks like a clown. I am afraid of clowns and I haven't even seen ""IT. ""   However, I did see a Stephen King movie on New Years a couple years ago with 2  girls from Scotland. New's Years Day was 32 hours for me because I was  traveling back from Israel. That was a great trip. Well, it's been 20 minutes  and I feel like there's not much else needed to say. ""Good morning, and in case  I don't se "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am very famished right now. I just got back from the psychology class. My stomach is gnawing, and I feel the grinding emotions. I haven't been very energetic the whole day. I almost fell asleep in my calculus class today. This is terrible, because I have never really gotten that tired in high school before. It always just seemed to be the calculus class that I almost fall asleep in. I am very frustrated at school. It is not only that I am a freshman, and that I am still trying to adjust to college life, but it is also due to my classes. For example, I have a biology class, with an excellent professor. However, his teaching assistant is making me really upset, because he can't really speak english. He is Indian, and I am sure he must be very intelligent, but I cannot understand what he is saying most of the time. I understand him on that basis, because I am after all a foreign student, and 4 years of high school have really changed my speaking capabilities. But I guess the older one gets, the harder it is for them to learn and adapt to new things. Anyway, I was vexed too, because he would not explain the questions asked by himself, but he would ask the class to input their answers. I understand that he wants the class to participate as a whole, but he can't just rely on students' answers. After all, we are just as confused. Math class is almost the same, except my math teacher speaks better than him. But Math has always been a tough area of subject for me. I have a bad history of math, and therefore I think that class is prone to my exhaustion. My professor is explaining math thoroughly, and he is very helpful and good, but my dislike for math overcomes me. I know that it is mind over matter, and that if I try to psyched myself to like math, I could probably get to put my energy into it. Don't get me wrong. I have always been a good student. I was valedictorian of my high school, and my high school is one of the best in Dallas. However, there are always some flaws even to the perfect, because no one is infallible, and I tend to procrastinate. This in the end results in my fears now. I am getting so nervous every day, because I am behind in my reading of assignments, and I am   worried that some professors are going to spring out pop-quizzes on me. I  also noticed that I not only tire so easily now, but my attention span has also increased, and my thoughts wander so much to the insignificant matter. I can't seem to concentrate reading in my room, when all the food, bed, noises, and I guess everything seems to distract me. Also, I have never been in a relationship before, not even dating, and in college, I thought it is where one may start for me. I often find myself looking out for guys. Even if I do get into one, I am sure that I will not do anything to jeopardize my future. I really want to be a doctor, and I am right now very worried about medical school. I really want to enter Harvard, and I am rather mad that they deferred me during early decision, and didn't admit me during spring decision. I guess I am being irrational here, but I did harbor the hope that I could get in because of the deferral. But that stumbling block will not trip me, I will still continue to work hard in college, get out with a 4. 0 GPA, and hopefully a high MCAT score, and hope that I can apply to Harvard and get into med school. That would be a very nice, ultimate dream that I would ever want to fulfill. I am very hungry right now, and I am having a major headache trying to think if I should double major in something, because it is not wise just to major in biology, and think that everything including medical school will be smooth for me. I think I will visit my advisor on Friday.     "
Tell me about yourself.,"As I sit here at my computer, I can't help but think about everything going on in my life right now. This year has been an incredible time in my life. My senior year in highschool, I was involved in many extracurricular activities. I was one of the head dance team captains, I was the Student Counsil spirit committee chairperson, and I was involved in Key club. I felt I had everything going for me. I had gotten into UT with my best friend. We couldn't believe both of us got in. I remember my best friend got in first and I didn't think I had gotten in. Every time I checked online it said I was still in review. A week later she calls me and says she has some good news. The first thing she said was,""so what color bed spread do you want to get. ""  I knew right away what she was saying. I was so excited. After that there was no more pressure as to if I had gotten in or not. The pressure now was the fact that in a few months I was going to have to live on my own. It was weird because it would never hit me that I was really going to be in college. Even a week before I was going to leave I still couldn't tell myself I was leaving. The day I got up here was really hot and tiring. Moving stuff up and down the elevators from the parking garage to the dorm, then from the dorm up to my room. The halls were very hot and crowded. We had to wait in a line to even get into the elevator. Once I got all my stuff into my room I now had to unpack it all and organize it all. I remember feeling so disorganized. When I feel disorganized I begin to get upset. Well my parents were being very helpful and understanding. There was a point when I just wanted to cry. After an hour or two my parents left and it was just me and my best friend in our room. I had to move stuff around almost 5 times before I was happy, but even then I did not feel satisfied. Atleast right now I think I can say I am happy about my room. That is after a few shopping trips. This morning was the big football game against Stanford. We had tickets to go but it was just too hot. All I have to do though is look out my window and I can see the whole stadium full of screaming fans. I do have to say I have a wonderful view. While sitting here in my room after a week or two of classes gone by, I feel I am more comfortable. I feel a sense of pride, a sense of independance, and all in all I am now very happy. I have met many intersting people, I love all my classes, and most of all I love UT. The funny thing is that it has finally hit me that I am now in college. Being the oldest in the family made it a little harder leaving, but all my life I have been the one to do everything first. My parents are very proud of me and I can say that I am very proud of myself. "
Tell me about yourself.,"As I sat here reading the assignment, half of me read the words while the other half of me sat concentrating on my sweaty palms that I only seconds ago was rubbing. My stomach is apparently telling me that I am hungry in its own noisy language. I just went to a 50th anniversary party for my grandparents last night. I got up to speak with the other grandkids. My cousin Jaffray, who lost her mother (my aunt) about 10 years ago spoke before me about how incredibly remarkable they have been acting as her parental role models, support system, and financial suppliers. By the time the michrophone ( I do not know how to spell ""mike"" [I guess]) got to me. . well- I didn't get to speak. I woke up this morning thinking about what I wanted to say, and I decided that whenI finish this assignment, I will write them a note to write them what my tears prevented me from saying. That reminds me of another letter I need to write- a totally belated graduation present thank you letter. I don't feel like a complete jerk- I received the gift pretty late. I just took notice of my blistered feet. They took some serious heat from rush. My sister and I are now in the same sorority. Hopefully, that can be a tie that binds. We get along so well- when we're apart. It's kind of a shame that we lived together for so long (sometimes sharing a room) because we probably could have been the best of friends. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Okay, my thoughts. a jumble right now, let's see if I can sort them out. My feelings are peaceful array, overwhelmed, giving God praise and glory for His awesomeness. I just looked at a person, just looked at his face, tried to figure out if he was good-looking or not and then punished myself for doing it because I have a guy, I need to stop looking at others. Or do I, confusion is going on in there right now but also a  peace or something that is covering over all of it. Put there by God I know His truth will come out in time. I am suppressing something, a feeling I have a lot. Suppressing emotions, bad things, allowing myself to think of something??  I don't know, is it a discipline to control the mind. deep down is that constant. God is there watching loving taking care of me, His will is at the center, my will fighting with His will, but another side of me so wanting Him  to take over and control my whole life. I am tired, but why?  I slept in until 9:00a. m. today, I shouldn't be tired, I wonder if the sky and weather outside have anything to do with it??  a little bit down. i didn't hear from Jeromed today yet. always that little doubt, is he given up?  but I doubt but deep deep down I know ther is something there holding it so strong, or stopping me from worrying and getting taken over by it, a holding on so hard to God and knowing that what He has deemed right and true will come for I have given Him my life to be in control of . Why did that Psychology test ask such dumb questions?  I mean about sex and just assuming that everyone has had it and asking about it. I feel a little bit dirty considering and thinking about those different types of sex there are. I am pure, a virgin and I plan to stay that way until marriage. It is so sad, but those types of people must be rare in the world today, I have been secluded from the real world it seems, well kind-of, not too much. Actually what is the real world. I'm thinking and holding onto the fact that actually the way God sees things is the real world. We can blind ourselves so easily to what is real and fake and what really does or doesn't matter. People care so much about nothing. things that won't last things that won't follow aor come with them after they die, now I'm getting bored with this subject but I want to finish it out. I so desire my roommates to come to know Christ. I am worried about my witness and just as I live what I portray, today's society doesn't care about who or what you worship, oh it's all good , hey that's great you believe in this and she in that and I in this. How sad is that, the truth is God,  but also people won't accept that unless God is there working , what does convince a person to become a Christian or is that the right words to use, now onto camp, a picture of the campfire with boys all around it, the orange nice comforting mysterious warm flames in the middle of a set of logs and as I approach it down the steep hill I hear jabbering and talking and I see the beautiful red, orange, pink cloud overhead, how is that so beautiful?  How do those colors come out?  I don't know, but it  is awesome!  then I see the staff, Jerome, Susan, Nicole (she most prevelently), Holly, and others. then I sit next to Jerome and my heart just warms up, I don't know what to say or where  to look and I'm just glad I'm next to him, we can't touch, don't let the kids know that we are dating, it would be better if they didn't know about this, Jerome had said,  okay, with God's help I can behave myself. It's not that hard to make myself do something, good. We sit there and I just glance at him and his one yellow and blue eye and his other blue eye, how in the world did someone so handsome and with so much integrity and love come to want me and want to date me and care for me. I don't know, I have no idea about myself, it's just me and though, me , a continuous struggle and fight to let God rule and reign or me to take over. Again how is Christ going to shine. I don't want to change with god and though deep down he is there and it seems nothing will change that, but how do I know what will happen in the future?  I don't, but the one person I do know and is always there is in the future now and knows. all-knowing, all-powerful, everywhere, God!! Not myself, I can't ever be god I am so fallible and a sinner!  Only God!  Okay, just looked at the clock and actually I am enjoying this writing all my thoughts. At the beginning I was skeptical of this whole assignment. why should I focus on myself?  anyway, it is fun to put into words my thoughts and interesting what I actually think about within 20 minutes. It seems a lot of Jerome and of God and issues. These are my thougts for the last 20 minutes. Hmmm! :) "
Tell me about yourself.,"I wonder what I am doing right now, this is a little annoying, stupid grammer mistakes are irritating me. Hmmm, I hope that Jennifer likes the present that I have for her. How am I going to get back, and how am I going to get back? How much will it cost, how will I do on my psychology test I have the coming monday. I hope that I will still have time to study. Oh well, I'm tired I really wish I didn't have to do this right now. Hehehe, I wonder if that guy I just e-mailed will reply to me anytime soon, and I wonder if he'll actually have what I want. How much will the new motherboard I need cost? Can I wait 3 months? I hate waiting, oh well. I wonder if Jennifer is asleep right now, I really do miss her. Atleast I'll get to see her when I go back for her birthday next week. This is really going to take a long time to do, the writing assignment I'm doing right now. Havnt' played pool in a while, I hope that I'm still decent. What's on the TV right now and why am I paying so much attention to the way that I'm typing right now, I keep going back and making corrections to my mistakes when it already said I shouldn't. Bad habit I guess, always want everything to be perfect. Dumb Browser, messing up. Annoying sound. I hope that when I go to Block-buster tomorrow they will Final Fantasy VIII. I wonder if it will be as good as it's supposed to be. I hope that I do good in college, get goood grades and do well in general, though I also hope that I have fun also. It's a bit anoyying having to think and type so fast at the same time oh well. I have to do it for my assignment. The TV is really loud and annoying right now, unfortunately my roommate is watching it right now and I'm doing thing right now so I can't stop and turn it down or anything. I like my roommate pretty much we get a long pretty well, but anyways why am I thinking of this, never knew that my mind switched from thoughts so suddenly. I wonder if I have attention defecit disorder. I hope now, that would be really bad, though that might explain why I never really did as well as my brother or sister in school. I wonder what they are doing now. I wonder if they've ever drunk alcohol. Anyways, that's none of my bussiness. Hmmmmm. I wish I didn't have to go to school tomorrow, wish I could just stay home and just rest and enjoy myself. I sill need to do my calculus, philosophy, and psychology. The other part of it atleast. It's a little difficult right now with all these distractions, but I guess I'll cope. Hmm. don't really know what to think about or write about right now. Hmm I wonder how much my plane ticket will cost when I buy it, I hope it doesn't cost too much. But it's for her, so I guess it's worth it. Wish I could see her right now. I rememver the first time I saw her, it was a little strange and I didn't know her name. hehehe. she was cute, nice to look at and she was nice  too. anyways I'd better stop thinking about her and get my mind on some work. Another thing I wonder how I'm going to pay for my plane ticket I still havn't recieved my bank card or checking card from Bank of America. Annoying. Hmmm. Those funyons look good right now, I wonder if I should stop right now and eat some food. I wonder if the milk is still good, or if it's bad now. I'm in the mood for some cereal right now, kinda wierd. But I've always been a little wierd. Anyways this is getting rediculous and a bit tedious also on my fingers. getting tired from just looking at the screen right now and typing. oh well. how much longer is it, oh  5 minutes. I guess that's not too bad. Hmmm. I want to stop. anoyying. oh well. aonly a little longer. I'm starting to get careless. but anyways. I wish Kevin would stop messaging me right now I'm trying to do this but I can't with him messageing me. TV is getting louder right now, must be some horror movie or something. too bad I can't turn around to look right now and type the same cause it would be a little difficult to do so right now while typing and having to occasionally look at the keyboard to make sure I don't mess up. I wonder if my fingers look wierd right now moving in this order. Oh well, who cares. Only 2 more minutes till I can stop and maybe either rest and sleep or eat some more food. Now what will I eat, cereal, hamburger??? who knows. I wonder how much I've typed already. Hopefully I typed a lot cause it would be cool if I would type really fast. One more minute right now. Why do I always put more periods than I need to???? I always do that with just about everything. but again who cares. Finally time is up!!!!!!!! "
Tell me about yourself.,"This is a really strange writing assignment. it's hard to write to keep up with your thought s. the U. s open is on tv right now, Serena Williams is playing Monica Seles. I'm not really sure who is winning but they look like pretty even competitores. Serena is eighteen and she is really improving while Seles is getting older now and she isn't as good as she use to be. It's really hard to make myself do all of the work for colloege. There is really a lot of reading and I'm having trouble deeping up. My mythology class has a lot of reading and its pretty boring so I end up putting it off. I really just do the work that I know I'm going to get quizzed over soon like in Calculus and Eco. Calculus is eadsy though because last year I learned al ot in Mr. Romano's class and the new teacher is just explaining the same old stuff. Psy is really interesting in class but I haven't read much for it because I took Psy last year in high school and we used the same book. So hopefully that will help me make good grades in it this year. I have so much reading to do for muythologe because we have a quiz on tuesday and it is going to be so hard because the teacher thinks that it is so interesting an that we remember like everything she says or assighns. The horse sale this weekend is going to be really fun. I hope we find another one like eden that will only sell for her broodmare value. I hope Shug agrees to take Cerise and Souther n I've. But if he doesn't then I guess that Cristophe will and he is a good trainer. It is so annoying that Southern Ivy's Jockey didn't listen to us in the race. He should have held her back at the beginning but he had to try to be a hotshot. She should have won. Oh well, she is only two now, I hope she has a lot more races ahead of her. She could be really good once she gets sorted out. I can't beleive that Anita's foal has such bad back legs. It seems to happen  every time when we breed to an outside stallion. I hope Brittany isn't too mad that I blew our meeting off today. But I just really wasn't in the mood to hassle with all the traffic and everything, besides, I didn't even understand the directions to the place. Oh yes!!! its already been twenty minutes. "
Tell me about yourself.,"What would happen without doing these writing assignments, how in the world does the Ta grade all off these papers with so many kids in the class. He would have to go crazy trying to give everyone a grade The view from my window is so drab I wish I lived on the eighth or even the seventh floor so I did not have to look at this wall all day. It is probably a nice day out but I can't tell because of this stupid wall. I need to go to the store. I hope that there is a good game of basketball at the gym today becasuse yesterday was boring, the girls team we played against the other day wasn't half bad, maybe they we show up again today. That girl was cute too, I wonder if she has a boyfriend. That girl down the hall needs to come back from wherever she went. She has the nicest hair. I need a haircut. I think that is the only reason I really want to go home is so I can get a haircut from Teri. I guess I could do it myself, I think I have my clippers, I can never reach all the way to the back. Oh well I really don't think it matters how your hair looks everyone is usually to drunk to even remember your name let alone how my hair looks. I do feel better when my hair looks good though I think it gives me more confidence, Why is that? I sure have a lot of questions. Maybe I should pray about them sometimes that works and with this whole college thing I could use some guidance. Man I am hungry I miss my moms cooking Maybe I should go home for the weekend, I am sure she misses me, I hope. The cafeteria hopefully is open today I think we are down to the last two poptarts and I am sure we ran out of oj and milk yesterday. Football starts next week and we need our lineup for the league, I need to get that email address from Brad to make sure we don't get penalized for being late or something gay like that. I don't want to do that chemistry assignment filling in those scantrons is so tedious and pointless. I can't get rid of this cough, that medicine that I have been taking just tastes good and does absolutely nothing for my chest or throat. I guess this is another day without food until we go to the store because the cafeteria is closed after one on holidays and with my laziness I didn't get up in time. Why didn't I set my alarm?  Breakfast is worth missing one hour of sleep especially when we have no food to eat until dinner. i need to go and check the mail, maybe that girl will have her door open and I can stop and talk with her, I wonder what she did this weekend. Long weekends are awesome. I wish we always had three days off it is so much more relaxing knowing that it is already tuesday when you go to your first class, it makes the week go so much faster. Does the mail come on Labor Day I don't think so but I really need to mail something oh well I guess it can wait until tommorrow. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I have heard of assignments like this one before, but never thought that I would sit at my computer for 20 minutes just typing away. but, thats what you want so here I go: hmmmm, I have a lot of work to get done, I need to get my girlfriend's birthday card written and sent out, her bday is on the 14th of this month. we have an interesting relatiosnship. she is going to AM next year so that makes me wonder a little, also, my parents don't know we are together, they would never accept her since she is white. I think thats bull shit personally. I have told my parents they are prejudice, they don't understnad that term I think. yeah, but we broke up before I went to UT this year so that we could just be friends but she doesn't think that fbeing fiends is right. she says either we get back together or don't weven talk anymore, so I got back together. I think it was like an ultimatum, she says that normal human beings would react the way that she did. I question that, heck, you could probably tell me since you're a psychology professor with a ph. d. in something related to psychology I assume. hmmmm, I think we are going to break up, just makes sense, but I don't want to hurt her and who kn ows, she maybe that ONE person and I may be throwing that away, which is a dumb thing to do. yeah, well, I also have lots of reading to do which I better get started on soon. my roommate and suitemate have gone to the library at least every other day and have done all there reading, but I haven't doneany of it. in high school, I never had to bother with any of that. the day before the test, iw oudl read up and be set. I know that won't work here proabbly but yet I still don't take the initiative to read. I think I may just be lazy, or I may tghink too much of myself and find mysefl screwed come sept. 14 since thats my first test, or its spet 16, eithe ron. e   hmmmm, man, dobie food sucks a lot, I ts good I guess but its just that I get so used to it and I hate standing in line. ,. yup yup. theres a lot of dumb bullshit things also, luike I have a friedn tht tells me ""oh, man, be careful when you hang out with them, they blah blah blah and all this. ""  they don't do anythingillegal, they just party or have minor problems if anythuing. let em figure tht out you know, she is quick to give me her opinon and I don't even ask for it. ppl that I respect because the hyave been successful, she says man, he is full of shit. whatevefr, he gets his stuff done and is very scuccessful (I am having a lunch meteting with him to figure out the stuff I should be doing and joining etc. ) and she thinks that he is jsut full of shit. I don't care really to hear it but I can't tell her to shut the *(& up because thats also wrong. sometimes, the situation demands to be mean or atleast abrasive, but thats difficult (not beacuse I don't know how to, I do, I am a former debater) but because its nott eh impression I wantt o give out. well I am getting tired right now, but there is only a few minutes left so I might as well continute. hmmmm, not much else is going on here. yeah there is this big thing about going and partying and drinking and etc,. definitely not my sceneinking, never done it, no inteention to, I just don't want to, but there is definitely pressure created when your firends (Since like age 2) are doing it, and then you wonder why not, might as well. hmmmm, I strill haven't but then again, I have gone home to houston every weekend so far to visit my mom and make sure everything is okay sin e no one else is home (my dad is in india of r business ) and I also went home to see alsion (my girlfriend of 1. 5 years)  that myb the reason she wants to saty together or not even get together, I think she is too attached (she says she loves me more than she has ever loved) she is my first girlfriend ( I love her, I think ) what is love? its a personal point of view that can nver be defined. there are too many differntt types of love, and then even romantic love is interpreted differently. I thinks thats weird. I have siad I love you and so has she but we may mean (although same principle) two completely different things. I think thats interesting. well, thats it my 20 miutes are up, I have been watching MTV and typing at the same time, and man, there a bunch of fine girls at UT, but I don;t think I will get any of them (oh well, I have alison and I don';t want any of thme rright now, buts its nice to know that you could get those irls if youw ant to you know) oh well, thats me thinkin gabout sex again. hehehhe. thats it, enjoy this, I certainly did typing it. see  you (keep this confidential -- I must assume it is) "
Tell me about yourself.,"well, today is a pretty easy relaxaing day. I've kinda gotten into the school mood now so it's not too hard to sit down and get stuff done like it was a couple days ago. when I got here I had no clue it was going to be just what I thought is was going to be like. needless to say, I'm happy. it feels just like a movie or something. I'm so lucky to have such a great roommate. she's so awesome. we knew eachother in high school but we never were great friends so it works out perfect. we always can feel free to go our separate ways and always have someone to come home to and share our nights with. we are so much alike and so much different that God sure put us in the right place. we make eachother laugh. she even hooked me up the other night with one of her friends and I had a great time. we were discussing something last night though. we haven't seemed to find our nitch yet. we've met a lot of people, together and separatly, but I guess it just takes awhile to find your friends huh?  I'm not too worried or depressed about it yet. I'm busy as it is. friends will come. I wish matt from orientation calls me. I think we could be really good friends. I'm pretty upset with some of my friends right now. mainly blake. my old best guy friend. we used to be so tight but now he's changed. all he cares about is partying and drinking and keeping an image. it's so not him and he knows it. he is so much better than that and we've even talked about it before. I just care for him and miss him but both of us are too stubborn to call first and stuff like that. we've always been that way. let me tell you, senior year with him was pretty stressful. I just wish sometimes things were what they used to be. don't get me wrong. I absolutely love college but I guess I miss all of the tight friendships I had and my little group at school. but I love everything about college (except for the showers) :)  well, that's it for now. besides the fact that I wish I had some significant other. or maybe I don't. sometimes I wish I did but I still enjoy looking at other guys and flirting and I'm still meeting people now so I guess it's good I'm not tied down. and I'm really excited I found a theater club I could join here. and I don't have to major in theater. I did a lot of that in high school (hated my teacher) but I was a role model to a lot of people and that made it easier to cope with her. I'm so glad that we have email today. it makes it such an easier way to talk and communicate with people. I miss my friends and family the most. I'm not really homesick yet, which is good I think. I think that shows a sign of maturity. I'm not going home this weekend. I know my parents would want me to but I don't really feel like it yet. I propbably will the next weekend maybe. I know I am for our high school's homecoming for sure. I think that everyone from my school that goes here is going back. I think that it will be fun. I loved high school football games. I went to every single one all four years but two of them my senior year. well, it's been past 20 minutes. until writing #2. "
Tell me about yourself.,"At this moment I am worried about completing this assignment. The main cause of my concern is that I am using a friend's computer. I do not own a computer and therefore it is very difficult to have access to class notes and homework assignments. I have never really dealt much with computers, so I am not very familiar with this type of technology. I have tried various times to seek help in a public librar, but I was unaware that a long process of aquiring an account and finding a payment plan (if I want to print) was required. This is especially hard for me because many of my classes offer class information on the web. Now proceeding to my next concern, tomorrow I have a major french exam. After finishing this assignment I must hurry to my apartment and eat lunch, then return to school. I have no idea what I will eat for lunch, but I must eat at home. Last weekend my parents came down from Lufkin to visit me. They swore that I had lost some pounds and that I must not be eating healthy. My parents worry about my health very much. Being from a hispanic background, education is not of importance. My father threatened to take my out of school if I did not start taking care of my health and house duties. My father believes that a woman's future is in the kitchen. He never realy supported me in my college education. In his own words, he didn't think I ""would make it in the real world"". My mother begged me to stay close to home and attend a community college. I refused because I am very ambitious and much of a dreamer. I wanted to attend a well-known university (UT) and nowhere else. I worked hard for 12 years to get this far. I did it with very few support from my parents . I encouraged myself to achieve everything I have. Perhaps it is better this way because my parents let me become independant and able to have my own dreams. They knew that if I achieved all my dreams, it would be because only I worked for it. Knowing that you made it almost alone gives a sense of immense satisfaction and self-worth. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Hi, I have no idea what I'm going to write but who cares, here goes. I'm right now sitting in a small computer lab down in the base ment of Jester West, across the where I now reside, in Jester East, doing a writing assignment for Psychology on what comes in to my mind first. Well, my mind is filled with stuff that's definitely not very much to do with a psychological sense. I've been away from books and studying for 2 3/4 years now, and 1 week into UT and 5 classes and 16credit hours later, myhead is sent reeling from the amazing amount of work that I have to do right now. I've totally forgotten everything to do with math and calculus is being thrown onto me at an amazing speed and at an extreme difficulty for me to comprehend. Basically, travelling halfway round the world to get hit with books that send you into unconsciousness is definitely not the nicest feeling to have at the moment. And the books. i have never seen paper cost so much in my entire life! Damn, now I know why americans are so rich. Nah, it's all understandable to me, it's just the matter of settling down into a different environment, and making myself a new circle of friendsfrom scratch. Not much in my mind now but complaints and angst now I guess, but it'll be definitely back to my books right after I complete this assignment, and maybe the next. Thoughts, Ithink that's been settled for now. et's get on to feelings. Well I'm feeling hot and bothered right now because we just had a fire drill, I thihnk, I did'nt exactly see any fire and we were allowed back into the building, just a while ago and had a thousand annoyed beings buzzing around the side of the building trying to comprehend in our little minds what the heck is going on here, hwo's the joker who pulled the alarm or wave his stupid little lighter flame below the automatic sensor??Jerk!  Now, let's get on to sensations. Hmm, seems kinda wierd to me what this means. Sends the little runners in my itsy brain go wandering all over the place and the component called imagination into overdrive. Nah, no dirty thoughts here, it's an educational institution. that's what they all say anyway. Well, my senses are kinda dulled right now. A result of chatting last night with my roommate till 1am and waking u p this morning at 7. damn, really hate early mornings, I'm not a morning type of guy but apparently all my classes start way too early in the morning. Calculus at that, is that a classic example of stress or what. But what better way to start the ol thinker working everyday with symbols and numbers geting thrown at me and expecting me to understand what's going on?? Really don't know actually. don't really care. i guess that's it 20 minutes, mebbe a bit less. tata! "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am really really really hot. I don't know what to say. My girlfriend just called she's going to New York. I have some pretty messed up feelings about that. To a certain extent I feel kinda abandoned going here to UT. All of my friends are going to that amazing just right school for them. Me. I took the easy cheap way out. I knew that I could get in here, so I only applied here. Thats not to say that I don't like it here, I really do. I think that it will be interesting. I am really hungry. My roomate isn't here, he's working. I get to go to the dining hall all by myself, and I get to sit down, all by myself, and I get to proceed to eat. all by myself. I really like my room. I don't know why, but for some reason It has just taken over and become home. I'm not sure what to think about this expirement. I know that I've done stream of concious writing before because I took some creative writing classes, but now I'm afraid that this is going to be used to analyze my brain and you're going to use it to steal my credit card number, and forge all sorts of stuff. Speaking of credit cards, I got my first today, and had to send it home with parents because you can only activate the cards from your home phone, what kind of messed up shit is that?  I'm sorry, I really should stop swearing. For some reason my mouth has to the potty since I started. I  d o n ' t  k n o w  w h a t  to  say. I'm sort of bored right now. And I'm sort of in a strange dillema. This is going to sound sort of like Jerry Springer. I don't know if I love my girlfriend. I mean, I do, that's not the issue. It's that she's going to New York, and I'm here. And I don't know what to do about that. I'm going out to see her at thanksgiving. I really miss what she brought to my life. It was that feeling of completeness. I know that this is bad, but I'm already starting to look around for something to replace that feeling that is gone. I think that long distance relationships suck. You know that I can type really really fast. Sometimes I think that I can type faster than I can think. Or maybe thats the other way around. Maybe that's the reason this is turning into somany things that I don't know were floating around inside my head. It is right now five fifty. I have ten minutes to go. I can't believe that you're going to actually read this. That is really impressive. I can't imagine reading six hundred different stream of concience writings. I think that either your going to grade them pass fail, or you're an insomniac with nothing better to do with your time. I really wish that I could have a totally silent computer. You know, that's not random, It has to the fact that right now it is humming. I would put in some music, but that would mean taking my hands from off of the keyboard, which is illegal. So instead I'll play the game by the rules, and sing along to something in my head. Jen, Jen, Jeeeee----eeen Jen, Jen. She doesn't fucking care are are. Whether I like her or not. Okay that didn't really work out. I hate how you can only remember the lyrics to one part of a song. You end up singing like this. Word Word Word, dum dum dee dum. This shit would be really funny if I could instead speak it to you. I gaurantee that I'm the guy who will never shut up. Although lately I feel that maybe I've been too quiet. I think it may be time to sing something in the dining hall, maybe that will make people want to sit with me. Only five minutes left. That means I can eat by my badass lonely self. It should be fun. Maybe I'll call this girl I know. The problem with that is that I don't know where or friendship begins and ends. I don't know if she even considers me a friend. Its a total fucking mystery to me. I want to sit her down and tell her look. I think that I like you. The problem is that I'm afraid of rejection and failure and all of that bad stuff. You see I think that maybe I would make a good psychiatrist, because I've been through some weird shit, and that would help me to understand what was going on in other people's minds. Maybe not. Maybe I'm just totally fucking alone in the world. It's a frightening thought. And there I go with the swearing thing again. I would go back and edit it for langauge and content, but I figure that you probably won't be reading this thing anyways, so what does it matter. I like the fact that you seem to know how to handle a big class. Sorry, I don't even know why I seem to be writing this to you. I really should be writing this to myself. And if I was writing this to myself, I think that maybe I would rather just mull over it in my own head, as opposed to online, on paper, on something. So that's what I'm going to do. Good bye Gotham City "

Tell me about yourself.,"well after being the first day of school, I really wonder how much harder the clsses will be. astronomy seems easy enoughas it is intended for non-science majors. but dr. pennebaker said that the class wouldbe hard. Doing assignments are no problem but I worry about the test. like what am I going to make?  will I get an a?  will my parents ever get off my back. I dunno.

"
Tell me about yourself.,"We went to Barton Springs today as a sorority, and met a bunch of my new pledge sisters. I just pledged Zeta Tau Alpha, and I absolutely love it. Today, we layed out beside the pool, which really has lake water in it,and I nearly fell asleep. When I put my feet in the water, it felt like I had just breaken through the top layer of Ice, and now my feet are in the water below it, like a pond that had been frozen over. It was really neat to see the different type of people that will soon become some of my best friends. Hopefully I will have gotten a tan. Yesterday, I went to the football game and met my boyfriend and his family there. He lives in Dallas and is a senior in high school. His brother is one of the starters on  the football team, so it was really neat to see him play. I sat with my boyfriend and his family, which I hadnt seen in a while. Later on that night we went to his brother's apartment and hung out. I was so happy to have seen my boyfriend. He's an incredible guy. Anyways, I could go on forever. My feet really hurt today from these little pieces of wood that were on the ground, and when I walked around with no shoes, it did not feel good. Right now, I am looking around my room and it looks so much different than it did a week ago, when I had not yet pledged a sorority. Everything I have now is zeta stuff. It really is kind of neat. I love being in a sorority. It's really a good chance to meet people and feel a sense of family even when you are away from family. Speaking of family, I really miss my family. My parents are divorced, and my dad lives in Massachuttes. My mom lives in Dallas with my two younger brothers. They miss me so much. Especially my dog, who uses the bathroom all over the house just to show us when he is mad or upset with us. My mom said that lately he has been doing that. I guess its because I left him. I always would play with him, such as throwing a frisbee and play tug-o-war. He was so attached to me it was unbelievable. Everywhere that I went in the house, he would follow. I love dogs. I can't wait to go home and see all of them. My brothers really miss me also. They don't have an older sister to boss them around anymore. My mom really misses me too. I was the only daughter, so she was very attached to me. She calls me about 5 times a day, and emails about 3. I guess as time passes by, she will get used to me being gone, but right now I don't think that she has adjusted very well. But I guess that goes for all moms when their children go off to college. And its kind of funny because I was really scared to come here. I have heard its just so big, and the sororities were so cruel. I was frightened. I had always wanted to go to A&M, because I am definitely the more conservative type, but I have amazed myself in that I absolutely love it here. Austin is such a neat town, and there is always something to do. In Dallas, we had to sit and figure out something to do on a Friday night. Most of the time, we never came up with anything. Here in Austin, there is not one night where nothing is going on. There's a ton of good restaurants and fun places to go to. Especially Barton Springs, it was a great place to go for a picnic on a Sunday afternoon. I have family down here in Austin, so it is neat to have a place to go. I feel much more secure. They are about 20 minutes away, which is perfect, because they are not too close, but they are close enough for me to drive over to whenever I get sick of the campus. My cousin, who just got back from a mission trip in the Phillippines, will be living at my aunt and uncles house next year while she is working at a church. It will be neat to finally be living in the same city as her. I have always seen her on trips and family stuff, but never have I actually been in the same place with here for more than a week. So I am really looking forward to the friendship and bond that we will be making this next year. I am hoping that my year goes good and that I can keep up with all of my classes. I am planning on going to all of them, and trying not to miss them. I also really want to keep up with the reading and stuff, so I wont be as stressed out at exam time. I am looking forward to this next year, but I know it will be a hard adjustment and a huge challenge, but I know that if I work hard and put my mind into everything, I will do great. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Ok. I've never done this before, so here it goes. I've just come back from houston and I ams so glad that I'm here. I miss the turtles. you know. the ones that are in the pond that';s in the midding of nowhere. anyway. I got back here. and did my laundry. I borrowed quarters. and found out I have a million pennies. That and big bills. I'm hungry but not really hungry. it's wierd. I live at doby and somehow when I eat. it's like this feeling that I'm not that hungry and that I don't need to eat. but once I'm in my room. I'm like a starving maniac. I don't know. I miss my boyfriend. Sometimes I feel lonely here. I mean, I'm not really lonely because of all the friends I met here. especially my roommate. she's really nice. if shere weren't here. then I would be so bored out of my mind. I think what takes my time is actually just watching a lot of tv. I've gotten used to watching daily soaps. can you believe that? I never watch soaps. and then I get on the net and check my nonexistant mail. and eat and sleep. I study at nights. I really am hoping that I do well here. I really need tobecause I thing I slacked off so much my senior year. I've got to do well. I promised myself and my parents. how can you write so much. my brain is totally wearing off. I decided to do this because I have a lack of want to study anymore and I know I can't put this off any longer. it's just something I have to do. I need to make sure that whatever essay I get that I'll try to get it done asap and not be a procrastinator like I am always. well, I went home and wanted to see my goddaughter. but my friends changed their number again. and somehow they forgot to reach me. and I'm so upset because I don't know when I'll see them again. this tiem I took a car. my friend drove the car. it's so much more comfortable than the greyhound. what's bad about it is that you have to worry about a ride to the greyhound. I still don't think I can find my way around just by the bus. it would be so much eaiser if I had a car. so much easier. god, I don't know why I sold that car. well. jason and I would bne fighting over it anyway. he's my brother. That is if he'll get off the computer trying to email his girlfriend all the time. I'm sure he will run out of things to say. nevermind. I'm washing my laundry. and got. that pounding. next door is giving a headache. he pounds that music all the time. like all the time. until 2 in the morning. and I don't know how I deal with it. and yet we're friends. yess. I only have another 7 minutes to go. this is taking too long. way too long. the daily thing I do is thing about my boyfriend. he said that he's be here. and I trust him on that. but he's transfering from california and needs to taek the tasp. I wish he were here. he can't talk to me often cause he lives with  his sister. and she dosn't like me. but I have no idea why. I'm such a good girl. I mean that. I do nothing wrong. I'm thinking of rushing. to rush and not join. isn't that twisted. I hear everyone does that. just to go to the parites. and meet the ppl. my boyfriend would be so jealous though. I can't tell him in any way. I think he still does not trust me thought he says he does. my room mate is lucky. she saw her kinda boyfriend. though he didn't spend just time with  her. but time with  his friends too. this is so hard. I think time is coming to an end. it should. ok. it's there. bye. I'm just kidding. I wish it were. ok. done. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I find your instructions extremely vague and confusing, I should hope your instructions would be more precise as to what you actually want, considering this is college. However, I will attempt to explain how ""my mind works. ""  At the moment, I am tired so I am in a cloudy state of mind. To be completely honest I am thinking I would rather be doing many other things with my friends than writing a prompt. I am also hungry because I have not eaten all day. Food is presently being prepared at my co-op so I am not particularly worried about starving. I find that if I something to be misleading or too broad, such as this writing assignment, I tend to get frustrated and pist off. Hence I tend to speak my opinion if I am in this state of mind. I am presently thinking about how much of a moron the person who wrote this assignment must be to try and make me think about my thoughts and then write about my thoughts as I was thinking about my thoughts. Sounds a little too contradictive to me. How could I think of any thoughts to write about when my thought is supposed be me thinking about my thoughts? I have found that I'll have an idea sometimes out of the blue, sometimes when situations spring them upon me. Whether the idea registers as a good one or not in my brain at the time, determines if I decide to take action, ponder it more, or dismiss it. My feelings at this point are that I would rather be having sex than writing a prompt as well. I could simply click a few buttons and check out some internet porn but I might as well keep writing. I feel even more tired now because I just got done shopping for four hours for my co-op. I don't particularly care very much for shopping but I do it because it is part of my duty to everyone at the co-op. I could use some music but am not near a stereo. Which brings up an important thought. I tend to ponder the ways and means of life when I play my own music better. I find that I helps me cope with and express my ideas in a form that is universal instead of English. My mind comprehends a thought and then interprets it as emotion or reason. Based upon the interpretation, my mind then clarifies what emotion or reason is to be felt or used and then determines a course of action. In the case of music, it sends impulses to my soul to tell my fingers what to play and in the case of reason it tells me what is rationally sound to deduce from my initial observations. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I don't really know how to start this. I'm not sure what I'm thinking. It's so hot and I'm so tired. I wish I could have watched the baseball game yesterday. People on the Emmy's give the stupidest speeches, I really like Noah Wiley. I wish I knew who a l;ot of the poeple who come up there are. I shouldn't have this on while I'm doing homework. I can't believe it took me so long to figure out Wilma Flinstone today at the picnic. I wish I had met more people and that the cute guy was there. It's 9:20, I need to go to bed early. I hope my alram wakes me up in the morning. I keep correcxting my spelling and I'm not supposed to do that. Those girls always play Dave Matthews, at least it's Dave Matthews. Maybe I should close the door. I think the people in the dorm think I work all the time. I hope the weird guys don't by to see Clare. I wish my room didn't look like this I'm so tired of it. two weeks into school and I'm tired of my room. twenty minutes is too long to do this. my watch ticks so lloud. I wish it would tsop, it's driving me crazy. Why is Clare's computer sneezing. The closest door is open, its bothering me. I should close the closet door and the otehr one. Why do we leave our door open so much. They tell you to lock it when you're in the room. We are going to be killed in our sleep actually we lock it in our sleep and leave it open when we're awake, so I don't think we'll be killed in our sleep. Clare's back. Clare's reading what I write. My concentration is broken. I can't do this, this is os hard. I don't think I'm thinking of anything original are thinking like I usually think because I know I'm supposed to be thinking. I wish frasier had won the emmy. What do I have this song on, I know I have it. this is do hard to do. I cna't think of anything when I'm supposed to be thinking of stuff. What cd, do I have this song on. I really wish that I could look and see what cd I have theat song on but I'm doing this and I still have ten minutes, no maybe 5 finutes left. I started at 9:17. I ahve five minutes to write what I'm thinking but all I'm thinking abbout is what to write, or what to think. Clare's killing her sheep. The one on her computerthat's sneezing. oh, I'm not supposed to do that, explain what I'm thinking. This is so ahrd. Who's that author who writes in stream of consiousness, I hated reading that book. what was that. james joyce. I wish my computer was faster. I really want a new one. buti don't want to ask. Clare says its faulkner. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I feel kind of nervous right now. I have never done anything like this before. at least not as something to turn in for a class. lately, I've been thinking about school and how this semester is going to. I need to start looking for a job sometime this week. one of my best friends is coming back from Sacremento, CA this weekend, so I'm really excited about that. I haven't bought all of my books yet, so I'm hoping to do that soon, especially for this class because we have a test pretty soon. I took this class last semester but I totally slacked off and got a D in it, but I need to take it again in order to get into child psychology. I don't want to let my parents down again. my sister took this semester off because she got bad grades last semester. I know that I can do really well this semester if I really want to and I think that I do. I just really hope that everything works out ok. I guess you've probably noticed by now that I ramble on and on. I think that stream of consciousness is really cool. I think it was Virginia Woolf who made it popular. I think it was her. I  loved the way she would start talking about one thing and then that thing would remind her of something else and then she'd go off on that. I don't know how much I'm supposed to be writing . I think this assignment is neat. I hope that I'm going to be able to handle working and goingt to school. I worked at late night at jester last semester, and I think it was the hours that threw me off because I would work from 8pm to 1am. I live at kinsolving this year and I think that it's a lot better than Jester. I think I've been writing quite a bit already and I think that this is my stream of consciousness. all that I really do think about is doing well this semester because I want to be an elementary teacher already. so I guess I just hope.    "
Tell me about yourself.,"I already miss Greg. I had forgotten how much fun we had together. Talking in depth ahbout philosophy and relationships. We also enjoyed playing cards and James Bond. I npticed Mark has taken a liking to Bond and he always plays it while on my bed. I can't belive he was sick and lying in my bed. All this and the fact that he can't make a joke well make me want him to hook up with Emily. They were made for each other. He does have a sense of homur thought. Atleast he isn't to weird a roomate. I do feel bad that I haven't taken out the trash yet. OIther than that I think I have been a good roomate. I think I made him jealous when Sarah and I were kding around. I could feel him shutting himself off from us and dwelling on his own sorrow that I am still convinced is caused by the fact that Emily and him are apart. I hope my relationship will prosper. Some changes need to be made on my controlling attention and Sarah trying to do the same. I don't belive the problems lie much more deeper than that, Altough I am looking at it from that perspective as well. I think if we continue to become aware of our prior mistakes happiness will prevail. We do have a good future if we have a liittle more personal attention and inner thought. I miss her now but I am glad she is out so that I may do my work including what I am doing now. I wonder if we will be able to eat together and if so, where and when. If O haven't heard from herr by 7:00 than I'll have a sandwhich here while I watch Simpson/X-Files and the inbetween, whatever the station decides needs a boast in ratings. I think it is so rediculous how most people will have little or only practical things toi do but will turn on the TV and zone out as they flip mindlessly thropught the same channels they just saw. If people would check out the TV schedule than maybe they could plan when to watch certain shows and when to do other tasks like reading a book of interest. Speaking of books, I have but a thousand to read. The Hobbit, Lord of the rings, that Star-Wars book, that buddism one, the Tenth Insight, The experiential guides and the Celestine Vision. I also want to read the bible for my own study and not because it was being forced on me. I don't believe in the present idea of God but see him more as just energy of which everything is made. Perhaps the tales will have some metaphoric meaning within my life as it has my parents. I still doubt that I will pick Christianity as my system of metaphors. I may actually be able to construck my own relegion with no influence from otheer religions that have meaning or scientific marrit. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I don't know what to do with my boyfriend. I am so distracted by him and I should be studying and trying to do reaslly well my first semester in College. I don't really feel that great today. I really feel like taking a bath. It would be really cool if our neighbors would urn down the music so our walls would stop shaking. I wonder eho the package is from that I got. It is really stupid that I won't be able to pick it up until Tuesday. My room is pretty lonely and the show on tv is pretty weird. I miss my roommate already. Maybe I should have gone home this weekend. Oh, well I guess my weekend is going ok because I got to see both Jared and Eddie yesterday and that made me happy. I miss Jared right now. I wish  my siter was here. We would have so much fun. I heard that she already took over my room. I don't really know what I think about that. I don't know how I am going to get all my work done, I can't believe I slacked off sp much and I would have had all my stuff done already. Oh well, I guess next time I will do better. I hope that I will be able to get my application to the Texas Spirits this week so I can start meeting people. Maybe I should have joined a sorority so that it might be easier to meet people. Hopefully with the things I am attempting to join I will be able to meet some more peope. It is so hard to meet girls to be friends with. Boys are so easy to meet because they almost always talk to you and try to get to know you. Maybe it is just hard for me to actually meet friends and not just acquaintances. All my frinds from high school were pretty much people that I had been friends with since CAtholic grade school. Making it not very common for me to meet all differnet people form many  difference places. Ut is sp doverse and so absolutely different from anywhere I have been before. Except for New York City, I guess. But I guess it is wierd because it is such a mix of people that are all my age and all here for the same reason and I guess that is prety hard to comprehend. I wonder ho Jennifer is at LSU. The last time I talked to her , she sounded like she was having the time of her life. I hope she doesn't forget all the fun we use to have and doesn't change that much. So far, it seems like Kristen and Colleen have changhed a lot and they have only been gone a toatla of like two weeks. I haven't talked to Sarah at all , I hope she is doing ok. I wonder if she has met WEs yet , I bet they would get along really well. This wirting is completely all over the place. I am not really sure how this shows the way my brain works. Iguess it has been about twenty minutes. so I guess I can end my rambling. "
Tell me about yourself.,"well, today was ok in te beginning, I met lucy for our first class and we sat together we pretty much spent most of the day together I just didn't realize how easy it was to spend time with someone new. she is just someone who's easy to get a long with  but after walking around campus for a million years we came to jester to check out the learnsing skills center and there was so much stuff there to help us study and do homework for cal and chem. the lady there was so nice and helpful, the trip was really worthwhile. I tried to buy stamps from the vending machine, but it just wouldn't take my money. I had to go back and forth too many times. finally I bought some out of the other machine where I didn't get ot chose which stamps I wanted which kinda pissed me off. then we went to dobie to visit karen and christy. while we were there I had fun. but then my ankle started hurting a lot and I guess I just walked on it too much. we went to eckerds to get my pictures and a lot of them look good. I was kinda mad that the pictures of the flowers and such I took got messed up and I can't retake them. oh well. I was kinda scared walking all the way back to kinsolving because ppl could see my injured ankle and someone could've just come up and assaulted me. at the time, I was kinda hoping someone would cause there's just so much stuff here that's depressing. when I got home, I was about to cry cause I was thinking again about how no one comes over here to visit me. I mean, who are my real friends (that is if I have any) they're so lazy they can't even come over here to visit. no one really calls me either. I just don't know how to describe it cause I know if I REALLY wanted to talk to them I could just call, but well, no one really calls me. it's just frustrating cause while erin's out all these ppl always call and when she's over she's on the phone so much and she goes out every night. i know I don't need to go out and be on the phone all the time, it's just that it's really lonely not hving anyone over here all the time to keep me company. maybe if erin and I were more talkative or she was home more often. i don't know, it's just weird. what am I supposed to do about stanley? I mean, I actually would've gotten into a relationship with  him even though I know it'd just be physical, but sometimes that's what I need. the touch of someone who cares. but I guess stanley doesn't really care. he just was thinking of himself and how he needed to satisfy his urges. it's not fair! it's not fiar at all that I have to be here alone when I see so many ppl on the outside who have b/f and g/f and they don't really look like they deserve them. I don't know where to go f/ here cause I feel so lonely a lot and no one can really understand how I feel. crying right now. i don't even feel as though god understands or can hear how troubled I am. i just wish that there was someone who REALLY cared, someone who'd ALWAYS be here for me. but it's like I can't REALLY count on anyone. everyone has their own life. and it's always about them. i don't like being alone. if I just killed myself, I could end all this, but I don't want to. but I do. i need to find out what the future will be like. even if I never find someone who appreciates me, if I can just somehow find some happiness. just a little. go one day where I don't cry or think about being lonely. just a little something. it's not fair. what do I do? it's hard to go on each day trying to endure the battles that come with  each day. trying to face the hardships. if only I could do what I really wanted to do. scrapbooks and drawing and painting have money to do what I wanted to. build my dream house. design it, oversee the construction. one day. that's my dream. to have a wonderful house to live in. where I can go to find myself at peace. a weight room, sauna, spa, pool, greehouse, huge living room with  a giant entertainment center, huge bedroom and bath, huge windows. a painting art room, dojo, so many things I want to do. but I don't know if that will bring me happiness. how am I supposed to be happy if I can't share the big house with  someone I love. someone who loves me back. loves me as much as I love them. it's hard to think of what love is when I think that I've been there, and not been able to feel the same f/ the other person. what am I doing here anyway?? there's nothing for me now. i'm so alone. alone in this room with  no one calling me, asking me to do anything. what kind of friends do I have? no one is as considerate as me or maybe as sensitive as me. i just don't like being alone. if someone wanted to ask me out, in desperation. like donald said, being in love with  the thought of being in love. maybe that's what I've been in with  anthony. but I really thought he was the one. the one I could spend my life with . will I ever be able to fine someone to end my loneliness? "
Tell me about yourself.,"Will I survive? That is what I am thinking about right now. I am here because someone gave me money to live in this dorm, go to classes, and actually learn about something that will be of value to my self and my community. Pressure. Everyone is depending on you. focus, is what I need ot keep sstudying and do homework every night. there is Spanish, Math which I already should know because I took calculus and made an A except I didnt remember a thing. I slacked off my senior year and abondoned my whole work ehtic. Sad, for me, because staring over is a pain. How ami going to make my lazy but become dedicated to my sutdies again? I am still dizzy from my long 11 hour nap. I want to shut out the world and just go to sleep, but that is too easy. How will I survive, how will I support my family? No, I wont sleep. I will finish this writing assignment. Then finish my pre-clculus, aftter that Spanish, then I will read my psychology book. My wrists are starting  to hurt a little. I have not typed in such a while. it feelslike theyre going to go stiff on me like the way they do when I'm doing curls and I can't make another rep. Today is chest day. I have tofollow this new workout program called periodization. I'm kind of hesitant because it seems like I will be losing some of my hard gain that I have achieved. Gregory gym sucks. Its always so crowded so how am I supposed to get a good waorkout? on the other hand the female persuasion is very represented. But that si also a distraction. Boy I have 160 dollars to live on for the next 2 months and I am worried that I might starve or something. I hate being hungry. it is the worst feeling ever. I could never be homeless. It is too hot inTexas to be abeggar. Iwould haveto move to Ohio or somewhere cooler. poor homeless people! Well my back is starting to hurt on my right side. I think it is because of the way that I slept. since I've been here all I do is listen to music that I slisstened to back home. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Upon coming to UT I thought about it in much detail. Being used to air conditioned High School, I told my roommate that I think that the entire university should be one building. This building would have to be about 100 stories high, or remain the same size, just in a huge bubble. Now that class has started, I see that the temp. problem is not that big of a deal, so I say screw it. I also thought class would be easier. Since there aren't any daily grades, quizes, or numerous tests, I find it difficult to be happy with my current state of mind concerning my academics. I constantly feel that I need to study. I find this extremely difficult lately now that the fraternity has us running around with little time for relaxation. Thank goodness they allow us study time. I don't know much about college life yet because I haven't been through at least one semester yet, but I don't think engineering will be as easy as I had hoped. The math concerning the major is so overwhelming that I find myself with extremely high levels of anxiety while attending the class. The TA teaches on tues. /thurs. and then I have a supplemental instruction class too. If it wasn't for the GE (supplemental) class I don't think I would be able to cut it. I came out of high school thinking that math was just natural, but I realize that the quality of teachers makes all the difference in the world. I realize how jaded the topics I discuss are and also want to mention that I am extremely frustrated with the entry level professors (I'm really just dirrecting my anger towards the math department). The guy barely speeks english and he basically stands at the front of the class and puts on a display of how good he is at math. ""OOH, look at me I'm Romanian and I know lots of math; you can never know as much math as me. To make sure you never know as much math as me I'm going to run though this matterial so quickly that none of you can process it and assign you so much homework that with my shortcummings as a teacher, you with surely sit for hours trying to figure out this stuff on your own. ""  I am obviously dramatizing the situation, but this is the only way I can describe my frustration; however there is some truth to my insanity. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I've done this type of assignment before. Sophomore year of high school for mrs. hollingsworth. All I talked about was diet coke, because she had one on her desk. Today I went to class and I though I would be late to spanish because I was coming straight from sociology class. I didn't even lock my bike up right, someone could've pulled the wheel off and taken my frame. I woulda been walking back to my dorm with a wheel, a u-lock, and a frown on my face. It was hard to focus when all I'm thinking about during a class is how stupid I was to lock my bike up wrong. It didn't get stolen so that was good I just rode it back and I was fine. I hate riding along busy streets I never know if I should be on the sidewalk or on the street, the crosswalk or the lanes. It's so crazy, usually I just go back and forth and try not to get run over. this morning I got up and ate yogurt too quickly I felt kinda crazy in the stomach for my first classes. It went away once I was able to drink some water and let time pass. For a while I was wondering whether there was a reason why that yogurt was the cheapest. I always try to find the cheapest stuff at the grocery store. Yesterday was the first day that I used a push basket at the supermarket. I usually just walk around holding all the goods in my hands but there was too much. It was kind of a weird feeling because it was like I was growing up or something. I have to start clipping coupons and writing checks and things like that, yesterday when I was pushing the cart, that was the icing on the cake. Next thing I know I'll be getting married and crap like that. I guess all that stuff isn't so bad, but it seems like I got a grasp for the real world so quickly, but I'm not even in it yet, whatever it even is. I always think about the book Babbit, by Sinclair Lewis. He is painted in the book as some horrible guy who sells out his own beliefs and everything else so he can gain prestige and what not in his community. It's really hard for me becuase he is very human. There are aspects of George Babbit in all of us, and drives me crazy. I have a constant struggle within myself to decide whether or not you should hold strong to minor beliefs and principles and be held back in the system, or if you should try and play the system and get what you can out of it. If you play the system though it's kind of like selling out, you just become an opportunist. But it seems like you have to compromise your beliefs to certain degree. It seems like every decision I make, I don't know if I should do things to appease people and get ahead, or to hold fast to things. I'm not talking about the biggies though, just the small things. I would be afraid though that the more I ignore the small things, I might gradually start into the big things. I don't want to become like Kurtz, he had no restraint and he just got more and more into a state of immorality and all this other stuff. I'd like to think that I had restraint, but I have no clue if I do or not. I can demonstrate restraint in small cases, but Kurtz could too when he was in the confines of society. I don't know if I would revert like he did, I hope not, but no one can say unless they cross the same bridges that he did. Heart of Darkness is definitely my favorite book, it is really thought provoking and there are so many levels that you can interpret at. I read it for school last year and loved it, I read it about five3 times after that too because it's so good. I really like Joseph COnrad, but I usually odn't talk to too many people about him unless I'm drinking and my tongue gets loosened. Most people talk about sex and things like that when they drink. I always talk about Heart of Darkness, William Shakespeare, and Lord Byron. I don't really drink that much, but it's happened before and those were my favorite discussion topics. Once I tried to tell this guy about Freud and the ID, EGO, and Superego. All the sober people told me that I was 100% right in all my statements, but the drunk people just didn't understand. I don't know what to write right now, I have a lot going on right now. Most of my classes seem like they're going to be pretty easy, but I never know. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, I'm confused with my computer, its unusually working slowly and it freezes a lot. I gave my computer to my friend Neeraj who fixed the major problem of it. When I turned my computer on it would never load windows and the start up menu would appear. I thought that he broke it because he came from UH up here last week and he clocked my computer from 400MHz to 420MHz. After he left and I tried my computer it would not load Windows and the start up menu would always appear. So this labor day weekend I came home, my parents were shocked to see me because I forgot to tell them that I was coming. But they were happy and kept asking me how college is and giving me tips of not goofing around too much. I also went to eyemasters in West oaks mall there I was very shocked to see my friend Diana who is now a junior in high school but I still think of her as a freshmen because shes like a little sister to me. Everyone thinks she's very gorgeous I now think so too because I never thought of her that way. Anyways she told me her brother was getting her a job there because he works there. But she told me she didn't want to work there because her brither is there and she has to act a certain way and I know what she means. Her brother Wilmot is huge, he's probably 23 yrs old and he goes to UH. Well, I saw her there but I didn't say much, it was really busy I wish I could talk to her but I just said something on the lines of ""nice to see you, well bye"" I went to eyemasters to get nose pads for my glasses. I use those glasses to play basketball with. But I saw prescription goggles there and that's what I've been looking for, they costed one hundred dollars though, I'll probably get them with my work study money, once I start recieving it. Yeah, I work at Batts hall and I the Jester media center ehich is upstairs. Gary Dickerson is my boss and he's really cool. He smokes and curses and is a gradute  of UT with a 3. 78 GPA!!  I really hope I do well in my first year at UT, my classes aren't extremely hard, but everyones like college is nothing like high school its very hard. Actually I see college as not hard but just a level. You have so much free time, you are 75% of the time out of class. So there;s a lot of time to study an make good grades. The bad part is you can never slack off more than a couple of times, and that's where I see people make their mistakes, I've seen and heard of so many people I know do very bad with horrendous GPA's and I don't understand. Do these people realize how lucky they are to be in college? To improve on certain skills to make incredible amounts of money. Most do but some idiots don't and that's why there all crying by their junior or senior years in college hen they realize they should have chosen their books most of the time over their friends. I know I barely studied and still got good grades in high school, but I know college is a lot different. I have to manage my time wisely and study and do homework all the time and everyday, then goof around over the weekends whenever I surely have free time. Well, my twenty minutes are up. "
Tell me about yourself.,"What am I thinking of right now?  I am thinking of how different my life now is. it is hard to believe that almost 3 weeks ago I left the city to which I have known as home my entire life <houston> and moved to austin by myself, with really no friends, no family and no place to really call home here. But everyone loves austin, right, and I am really lucky to be here, right?  I don't know but all I know is that I hope I made the right choice, my parents and friends, and family members really miss me and I miss them as well. I just really feel so lonely up here, I mean all I really do is study and watch television, not really being very social with that many people. And the weird thing is I am a very social person-- I mean in houston I had I think seven very clost friends, and now I have probably five okay friends that live in the same city as me, and who am I talking to when I am on the phone--my friends from houston, NOT austin. I think I am just in a period of adjustment right now, or at least I think and hope that I am. please do not let my college experience turn into this--my worst dream. why is it so hard for me to move on and make new best friends, it is not like I would forget about my friends from houston, I could be close to both sets of friends, and why is it that no people are out of there way friendly here, is it me?  no it cannot be me, that is what I always seem to tell myself, that it is not me. Gosh, I feel like I am having a conversation with myself right now, or that this an entry in my diary or journal or something!  But this is truly how I feel at this very moment in time---scared, alone, and wishing that I were somewhere else. I am really not trying to whine or anything, but how am I supposed to feel?  I am alone in a city, with nobody close, with whom I can communicate with. And these are supposed to be the best years of our lives, right?  Just checking because I plan to hold whoever first said it on that. Other than that, everything is going great, I am keeping up with my classwork, studying every night, with no disturbances. WHY?  because I have no friends up here, I realize that I am complaining an awful lot and really exaggerating when I say I have no friends. But like I said earlier:  I am a very social person, and when I do not have caring people around me, I feel left out. And that just about ends the twenty minutes, I guess it's on to the next one---and Yes, it does feel good to get this out in the open.         "
Tell me about yourself.,"well I don't know what to say but I think I should start by sayin I'm really beginning to appreaciate the little things of life. I always have but learning about the body is facinating. the brain especially. there have been times when I feel things and wonder, but I'm now getting some answers due to this book. the class we havnt learned much but the book I've gone ahead. i think about all kinds a things. mostly music and social justice. besides psyc, I got bio which is boring so far but I know I like it . my other classes r mexican american study classes which are all intertwing, or overlap. i think college is coo so far, but for other people I'm sure its harder for others. u se e I've always pretty much been alone, besides my mom. my parents divrced when I was 3, and ever since then my father figures have been in a almost constant shuffle. from my stepdad, to my uncle, to a rapper that I consider my biggest influence, and the last 15 years later my dad. i feel alota anger deep down but have always been able to control it. most of the  time but we all have outlashes I guess. now I am just starting to reach a stable state,,I'm here finally,,no more anticipation,,I'm off weed and drinking,,but the main issues are always family and my lady. shes still in san jose, ca where I'm from. i don't know if I should be faithful or what but I think so. weve talked about a lot a things in our year together and I've taen a lot a shit out onher. i miss every1 a lot but I'm a strong person that can overcome it. always have. adversity is a part of my life that I take in stride. u have too. i see all these others here adapting and hardly any look happy,,they look all fake but maybe its just cuzz I'm on the outside just the way I like it. i'm a chicano here and it seems 90% are all white and 5% asian, 4% black , and 1% other. i also don't like it cuzz I havent really been far from campus cause no car and its to hot to take the bus. I love the bus cause I get to see all the poor people that I love associating wiht. the other homeboys and girls in the struggle or the older mexicans. u can learn a lot from talking to strangers or just observing. thats what I've always done at home and I look forward to doing it here. thats y I came here instead of miami,,cause theres mexicans here. i got a lota pride and love for my people. thats y sometimes my relationship tears me apart. my lady is white. i don't know how it happened,,we started as nothing and ended up being perfect. but llike everyhting I think theres a reason and I know if its meant to be I can work through it. i liked the part of the text that talked about anger and the balence of hapiness we all achieve,,,money doesn't make any1 better. in y opinion its almost like it makes potentially good people worse. but theres always exceptions. power is the other main curropter. or do people currupt power,,,who knows. i've always known that sensations were the vary things to guide ur life. they come from somewhere and I couldnt say where. i think god. gods everywhere. i don't go to church but in my heart I'm going the right direction, doing the right things. thats y u feel what u feel. ur direction and what u want to become. people don't realize that. and sometimes unfortuanatly people are very impressionable. especially in our society, putting aside color, gender, socioeconomic, everything,,,theres very few people that fight through it. i know iam 1 but I also know its harder to stay on top than just getting ther . i look forward to proving that I belong here "
Tell me about yourself.,"At the moment, I am tired. I just woke up a little while ago, and I'm writing. I can't stand writing. I don't mind the work. It's just that writing doesn't come naturally to me. I was wondering the other day, If college was reall going to change me into the genius I expect to be. I mean, when I get out into the career world, will I know ""everything"" I need to know about my job? Will I have to know everything? Will there be room for training and learning? Confusion! I guess its not a bad thing, but to be confused is embarrasing. I guess what I'm really getting at is without confusion life would be absolutely tedious. As I sit here in my apartment, closed off from society, I can't help but realize how much I miss my family back home. Although college is my main priority and the fact that I don't care what anyone thinks about me, I can't help but wonder if my family thinks I can make it or not, if I have what it takes. That is always in my mind somewhere. I, myself, know I can make it. I know I have what it takes to succeed. However, when I do graduate and get a career job, is that it? Is that going to be my life until I retire. I am very spontaneous and I won't be able to stand getting into a daily routine. I stopped writing for a second to gather my thoughts and I read the assignment again. I have no earthly idea how my mind works or why it works like it does. I'm not a scientist and I don't care to be. I just want to be happy. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now I am feeling very stressed out with all of the work and reading that my professors have given me. In my Language of the Stage class my teacher gave my about 60 pages to read and take notes from and we have to discuss the reading this Friday. It has alredy taken me a good long while to take notes on the first 17 pages. I don't know how I am going to read the rest. I am almost thinking that I should just not do it but if I did that I would feel very guilty about myself for not doing it. So I think that I am going to be pulling an all nighter trying to finish reading and taking noes on the materials. I just think that the work he put on us is a little harsh. That is a lot of work. Now my best friend from home was going to come stay with me one night this weekend. I was so excited because I haven't seen her since we both left for school, but now she is not coming but all of her friends that go to school with her now are going to come. I am so upset because I really wanted to see her. She is going back home to see her family instead. I know that she wanted to come stay with me but she just couldn't but I really wanted her here because I know that we would have had so much fun together and I wanted her to meet all of my friends. Oh well, I know that she will come to see me soon I hope. Well so far I have had a really good time here at school. I have become friends with a lot of cool people and my sister is here also. The only problem is that I have been going ouit almost every single night and it is really wearing me down. It's like I wnat to make good grades in school but I also want to go out and meet new people. I am also a Pi Phi here and so there is always something we have to do during the week. I really need to cut back on going out all the time and try to get some good sleep. I also need to start working out again because I don't want to gain weight and I am really afraid about that. I also want to work out just so that I feel good about myself and feel like I have done something productive for the day. I hate feeling like a slob and that is what I have felt like lately. Well I am having so much fun but I really miss my friends that aren't here. Only a couple of my friends are here but I enjoy meeting new people and getting to know everyone even though it can be hard when you don't know many people already. "
Tell me about yourself.,"it is about 509 and my roommates comp is making some noise and it has stopped now. I am now thinking about what I will (telephone noise) do when it is 529. that is when I will stop typing. I am thinking a bout my girlfriend. she is at a and m. I have a yaga sticker on my cd case. I took my cds out of my chest the other day, I mean yesterday, becaues I am not really worried about people stealing them any more. I once heard tht people sometimes steal toher peoples' pilows. my gir(keyboard is on my lap but io just took it off because I don't like that) I wish I could type faster but I can type plenty fast enough to do what I need to do. I have not really been using a lot of instant messenger lately. there are some people that I think it would be awkward to talk to like my gf. we kind of left withoutut breaking up but we both know it will not work ou. when I told my friend adam that she felt the same as me but I showed him her email and he believed me. she is not really like most girls and I said that was cool and he agreed with  me. I like to abbreviate when I typ and that comes from working on emails. I stopped for a seconnd to scroll up on the mouse because it does not move down by itself. I am now thinking how I do not type fast enough to say exactly what I think when I think it but I have to remember things (other things) as I am typing the thought that directly preceded it. my roommates are now staring at me as I type this and I am writing about it because that is what I am supposed to do. I hve stopped for a second to tell them about what the prof said today about the guy copyin gand pasting the computer manual and I thought that was pretty funny. my cousin did one of these stream of consciousness things and I don't think that I spelled that correctly. I think that this is getting pretty long enough and I will prolly cut it short before my time is up because I can. I know that rice university has the honor system and I don't know whether that would be cheating or not . it is now 518 and I have been typing for about nine minutes. whenever I write numbers I think it is easier if I just spell the number out but thinking back to this writing assignment, I have been spelling the time, so I don't know what that means. the social security comment was funny today. I accidentally came late to my french class today, the first day of school of all times, because I was playing squash and I thought it started at three instead of two. I actually think the yaga thing on my cd case is pretty cool even though yaga is not really a well known brand anymore. I would like to go to the gym todya but I would also like to et a  head start on the homework because I am still pretty motivated toward school, and I hope I will keep it up but I'm really not that sure because I know that this is different thatn highschool and I think I will like it more but my french teacher today told us some fascinating things about how speech is first started in babies and I was fascinated but then I went after calsss and apologized becase I was late. there is some real audo stuff we shoudl do for homework but I would like to do it in my own room instead of in the library becaus I don't know if we have to talk in to the computer or what. I am going to go now and I'd lkike to play some squash because it is fun. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am in the library trying to get my work done but I keep on thinking on what else o need to do. I hope I get adjusted to college life quicker so I will not be as stressed out as I am now. I am going home next weekend to see my family and all of my friends, I hope that they are all doing well. Some of my classes are pouring down on the homework and I am getting more worried as the days go by. tomorrow I have to essays due for one of my classes and I kind of do not understand them. I will be glas after I take my first tests and ace them all. Everybody was telling me that college will be hard if you get caught up in all of the other activities, so I am trying to stay focused on my studies rather than on extra things. I have been sleeping late and getting up early so I am tired for class but I have to force myself to stay awake and focus. After I am done writing this essay I have to start doing all of my other work so I can beat the deadlines and not wait until the last minute. When I get home I have to go to the gym and workout, orgainize my room and then cook myself some dinner. I have to watch what I eat or else I will put on weight and not be healthy. That will affect my studies and others. I hope that my family is doing well because I know that my mom is having a hard time letting me go to college because we were alone together for four years while my sisters were away at college. She already has a stressful life working 50 hours a week, driving home 45 minutes each day in traffic and then coming home and cooking for my sisters and me. I can just pray that she is not taking it to hard and will realize that this is something that I have to do. When I get out of college I hope to accomplish many of my goals that I have set for myself. Like having a great job that will pay me good money because of my great GPA, making a nice happy home with kids and a beautiful wife and doing anything that my family needs. I hope the relationship that I am in with this girl lasts for a lifetime because we are so good together and we love each other a lot. I am greatly attached to my girlfriend and I hope that I will be able to have her as my beautiful wife and have great children with her. I will see what happens through college and hopefully everything goes well. "
Tell me about yourself.,"9:55. 20 minutes. time?   Why did I wait so loong to do this? Well I didnt know about it until Thursday, but still, what happened Friday?  Oh yeah, I slept I think or maybe not it seems so far away. I guess its worth waiting since I got to see Elise. God I sometimes feel like we are in competition and I keep reminding myself that  it can't be like that. Of course this is texas where she is a goddess in her own right. I wonder why I have been denied the compliment of a man wanting to get physical since I've been here. Elise I can kind of see because she is older and attractive but I would say our looks are on equal par although mine do need a little outside help to get there. Maybe he just liked the smaller more natural look. God I need to loose weight. Why did she think I didnt need makeup or to loose weight and why couldnt she tell I had?  Maybe she feels threatened like I do. I bet thats it, we both feel threatened because we are seeing each other in a new environment. I kind of want to skip the greek festivle because I am afraid. I'm afraid of being the odd one out. Ok obviously I willl be like the only non greek. Niko,. how I wish I was greek or smatter sometimes. I miss feeling loved. I miss feeling strong and powerful. Although I do feel that way here sometimes. Texas just isn't right for my balance I think. Then again this is an emotional time of the month. But no I have been feeling a little off balance here most of the time. I gues sits good to face, but at the same time I just want to crawl back home to paris. Will I always think of it as home I wonder. God, sometimes the future is hopless. Dear god, why do I sometimes feel this desperate?   I know there are a lot of things I have done wrong, but I also know that I have been forgiven. Lord, I love you with all my heart and yearn for a way in which I can get to a church so that I can get the spiritual nourishment I need. I am starting to feel drained/. My father, jesus christ, please help me to help Elise. Help me to ease her fears and remind her that you are still waiting even though she feels like she is on empty. Lord I pray for my father, that you would help him to fight off this cancer. Christ Jesus please forgive me for my weaklness this weekend. After vowing to quit and taking an oath in your name my human weakness alowed me to cave. Please help remind me not to give  up, that mistakes are just that  nad that I neex to continue working towards being free from this drug. Lord Jesus, please remind me to turn to you and look upon you for strength because I know I don't have it. Please give my sisters strengtjh and wisdom as well. Help them to be happy and content in their new schools and to find good christian friends. Lord just help my mom to dela with all of the stressesd of my sisters and my dads probably illnrss returning and her new job. Lord please show her if it is not your will for he r to work and help emily and katie and rebecca not to feel the sudden decrease in time and attention thay may experience. Lord I pray for jUles. my heart is breaking for him because I love him so much. The thought of him tears me apart Lord. I know that everything happens for a reason and that I am unable to see this reason but that it is somehow part off your plan. Lord help me to recognize your plan for my life when I see it and to embrace it willingly as I believe I do now. Lord please continue to work in the life of Jules. Help him to see that there is a god and that you are he. Help him to understand how I know for certain and help him to experience this knowing and comunion that I am able to experience any time. Give him peace lord   jesus from whatever may torture his mind. Help Eric and Kate to find the same things too. To be an instrument rather than a hinderance to him and let him serve in the same way for them. time?  10:16. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I sit staring at the blue syllabus from the class in front of me. What do  I write about? The sad part is that it seems like such a miniscule task. Write about what I'm thinking about. So now I ponder what I normally think about? What do I normally think about, but I'm supposed to be writing about what I'm thinking about right now. I'm thinking I should turn of the television behind me, yet I'm so attracted to this rerun that I have watched so many times. Although since I am writing this, I am not exactly paying attention to what is going on on the television. I can hear the faint noice in the background. Why can't I concentrate? I always have this problem. I feel that my attention span has shortened as I have gotten older. I have problems watching a thirty minute television program! How can I sit here for twenty minutes on task? Especially since I have a million things to do. Such as a paper in my Literature and the Law class. But I am not able to sit for a long time and simply work on that paper. How did I ever get into college? Sure my grades were somewhat decent, yet I always tend to work to the point of exhaustion, mainly because I procrastinate. When I procastinate I do all at once. since my attention span is so short, and I am not able to sit and continuously put forth a vast amount of effort my work comes out poorly. This must be why I have only decent grades. I must put forth more of an effort. Life can be extremely challenging especially since I am not able to do such a miniscule task of prioritizing. But why am I complaining about my grades? College has just begun! I can turn around and begin new! But I say this every time and it never happens. Sure you can change anything, but come on, am I actually gonig to do that? NO! I'm just pathetic in that way. Its like all the people I know who have broken promises. Sure everyone says they'll do this or that,but do they? I am always upset when people break promises because I never break promises to other people except to myself! I can stop being a procastinator, but do I? I can start exercising more, but do I? The most important person in my life,me , is the one person who I put last. Who cares how I look to others as long as I feel good inside. Do I feel good inside? Hard question. Do I have an answer? I don't know. I'm constantly criticizing myself. Come on sonia, you can be better at this or that. But do I make a point of actually becoming better no! I suppose all people are like this, they attempt to be someone their not. I have to just face the fact that I am who I am and if I really want to change I have the chance but I don't have to change! "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm now worrying about what to write which is really irrelavant because to the instructions. I am at a loss. When the mind watches itself most of it stands still. But when it stops being vigilant it wanders anywhere and everywhere past, and future. Again I can think of nothing when watching the mind think of something which is very ironic. And again it stops and doesn't go anywhere when I try to see where it is. I hope I don't bomb this paper which I'm not sure how its to be graded. I bet my grammer really sucks, if I can use that word ""suck""  but I shouldn't worry about my grammar because it doesn't matter according to the instructions yet because of insecurities I still worry about my presentation, any presentation. Now I am talking to my friend and being distracted, but since I reallize it I'm no longer distracted. What else is going through this undeveloped mind of mine, wow, that rhymes, mind and mine, ok, I probably sound really stupid now but am just following instructions. The phone rings, and I think that it may be my mother checking up on me which she already did, but I'm sure would not hesitate to do it again. Room is now quiet with everybody gone, no distractions except for the unknown mind with all of its mysteries. Funny its always with us yet we know next to nothing about it which maybe this class will attempt to shed some light on but I doubt it will do very much good for anyone to decrease thier pains and increase their happiness. Everything in psych. is great but helps no one if it serves no purpose such as increasing the quality of ones life. Philosophy I believe tries to a bit more to do just that but is so abstract and too much of a subject to be studied than to be experienced and learned which doesn't help anyone anyways except to tickle and play with the intellect. Unless a certain form is adapted to the way of living and adopted as the way of thinking will it help those who really seek help. Now I'm a little afraid all that I just wrote is irrelevant to the assignment and will recieve a bad score. Perhaps another manifestation of insecurity. This world today is full of insecurities, fear, though we have everything anyone could want in the West, but yet we lack that which cannot be externaly obtained. How ironic that most of us strive in life but never know what we are striving for, what Steven Cohen calls personal management but lack of personal leadership, direction. Because we seem to have everything we want but are actually lacking we don't know where to direct our constant thirst for happiness and constant aversion of suffering. But the cause of our pains is ignorance, the lack of wisdom, wisdom - understanding but mostly realizing how things really are. Perhaps to this is to philisophical for the assignment. but as thoughts come into my head I write just like the instruction say. Although I can think of no reason for this assignment excpet to observe the mind, but I can not see anything to learn. yeah, maybe the next assignments are also like this, but probably not, wishful thinking. Almost done, just two more minutes and I maybe will continue the other assignments. Our study hall in our dorm really sucks. Its very creepy looking with all sorts of pipes and wires running through the wall. Uh, oh, girl thoughts, probably not appropriate, I don't even know if I spelled that word correctly. My mama told me that mastery over the mind is the highest form of victory anyone can have. It is said that a man may conquer a thousand people and a thousand lands, but it is far better to conquer himself just once. "
Tell me about yourself.,"feeling free right now. door underneath punded. resonated and left me shaking. there is music next to me and it has a beat. the bass bothers me sometimes. like when I was riding in the car with my brother when we went to the zoo that one time. he used to always pick on me but now he is not here. its not the first time that I hav enot seen him for awhile. but I see casey everyday. I like being here at ut. this apartment is great. just leaning against the bunkbed while typing feels great. I feel at home most of the time, except for tommy when he makes his comments. I keep expecting to have to go home and climb in my own bed but every time that I walk back to my dorm from here I realize that I am going to my new home , the dorm. My roommate is nice, she studies all the time. I feel that I don't study enough when I am with her. She is going to major in math just like I am. but I don't know what I want to do or if I really want math. this song is great. it makes me happy and hyper. but I am still upset that I don't know what I want to do. Everyone here does. they all have their special thing and I am just feeling the way along. that is more comfortable. the keyboard is on my lap and now my hands or wrists rather don't hurt as much. I like psychology. I am excited about the experiments. from what dougs mom was talking about them earlier they sound like a lot of fun. But I don't know if I will be able to just go up and talk to people like that. I am glad that I will have casey in my class this year. He is so smart and wonderful and I love him. I am really glad that we are engaged. he is the best thing that has happened to me since I moved to texas. Louisiana was not good at all but I have to stick up for it when doug and casey pick on me and tell me that I say things weirdly. This is a beautiful song. I really like it. But one bad thing about it is that I remember being with ryan when I listen to it. Riding around in caseys car when we were first going out. We listened to her then too and I made him sing to aida. He has a beautiful voicce and I love to listen to him sing. I love the way her voice sounds and the different inflections in all the right places. My foot itches and now that I scratched it, everything else is itching too. Sometimes they talk too much about computers and that junk. But that is their thing and it makes them happy. I just have to find what makes me happy. Skiing. I want to go skiing,  It is so hot here. skiing would be great and romantic. last year was the first time that I ever skiied and it was great. I did a lot of things with church that I had never done before but I think that all of these things were because I got together with casey. like this barbie girl song. I hated it but then he would always play aqua and I got to liking all of the songs and liking him more and loving him and falling for him and casey is wonderful. aqua/  like an ocean or island. so peaceful and wonderful. I like heroes the game with amanda, It reminds me of lord of the rings. My hair tickles my face. my ear itches. doug has a cute voice. he is trying to sing. idont hate casey's cat. it is really cute. I just wanted to get him something better and I wish I could have found a cuter one so I have to put it down because I don't know why. it does not really matter. I overreact too much and am selfish and whine. this is kind of fun actually. I want to take a photography class next semester. My mom says that I am good at it. I jsut want to find something that I am good at. Make everyone proud. But I put too much pressure on myself. I think that is why I am nervous this week because I want to adjust and I don't know if I am going to do well in my classes and I hope I do but am scared. My wrist hurts like when I am playing minesweeper. an addicting game. somethign I am good at, unlike half life which I am getting better at. My ear itches. I need to go to the store and get some cables, I hope to find them and understand how it works. physics scares me and I am not good at it. why am I majoring in math and how did sarah make up her mind in one weekend about college. I think those are the same reasons. Time's up. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Alright, today was a pretty boring day. I feel really unsatisfied with my classes because they do not stirr any special interest in me. I thought I would be excited about at least one of them but not yet. I guess I am just a little mentally tired. I was so happy to get back into the swing of things and try and find my friends. Acutally I think I expreienced a fake high because I miss Mexico a lot. I was there for the last half of the summer and made some amazing friends. I miss my boyfriend there too. I keep wondering if he is going to send me the ring he supposedly bought for me. Hopefully he will. I really want it. He told me he loves me, so I just hope he does not forget about me because I will never forget about him. he was so nice to me. All of my friends like him and besides the whole , he has two kids, thang everything is alright. I learned from him that no matter how serious skeletons in your closet might be, your heart wins overall. You cannot talk yourself out of loving someone. I guess I really cared for him more than I ever cared to admit to my roommate who thought I should of broken up with him. Too bad she ended up traveling around with some random guy around Mexico who she met before our language was over. Her guy has had at least 28 partners. If anything, she shouldn't of met her lover boy in Oaxcaca, MX. As for the rest of my dating life which seems to be my main concern these days, it is hella-active, like Cartman would say. This weekend I met some awesome guys. I am waiting to hear back from them. I can still hardly believe that I gave my number to a cute waiter at Papadeaux. I must be crazy. I usually just date around. I would love to find just one special person. I also need to workout more. I have been partying too much. Mexico was one big one month long party. Now I need to get serious about studying and try to find some interest in my classes. Everything seems to be running in circles in my mind. I am constantly thinking about boys, classes, and my friends who I really need to call and catch up. I can hardly believe I haven't talked to my closest friends in a month. it really feels good to get back in touch with them even though it is only over the computer. I am soo tired. I wish I could just take a nap and wake up stress free. All of these issues running across my mind are really stressing me out. I constantly feel tense. I hope I do not end up with some horrible health problems like my dad's family. Today at work we had to take a personality test and I scored high in a section that appearred to be Stress. I do not know what the category was but it started with an S and I am starting to stress out about even that. My body hates the beginning of school because everything feels so out of wack! Man, I already need a vacation. I am too tense for a 19 year old going on 40. Surprisingly I am not so nervous about the begining of the year but I can feel the potential homework overload slowly stressing me out. I am scared about my classes and I really need to get motivated instead of nervous. Writing down my thoughts is starting to stress me out. I am going to be so happy when I can submit this and check my e-mail. Then I can hear about my crazy friends' lives and take a break from mine. boo I have to wash my hair too and that is such a chore too. I wish I had naturally straight hair and legs as built as my dad. Then I would have hardly anything to worry about. I feel like such a basket case because I hardly voice my inner thought to anyone and I can hardly stop. I guess I usually set mine aside in order to enjoy a small vacation from my life and enjoy hearing from others. I really want to talk to my friend Lindsay tonight. She helps me forget about everything and just laugh out loud and be abnoxious without being self-conscience. My laugh is louder than the average laugh so people usually stare at me when I open my mouth and chuckle a little. I saw people looking at me tonight at dinner when I laughed. Oh well. They must be jealous, yeah right. I need to live a little. In Mexico I did everything I could ever dream of doing. I climbed a volcanoe, developed a love of horsebackriding, enjoyed my daring side, and much more. It sucks to have to slow down for school and dive into reading material I would rather use as a pillow. Oh well, my studying today will pay off tomorrow. Right? right. I need to take a nap. I did not get enough sleep last night and am drifting into lala land slowly. There is a fire alarm. I have to run. It just stopped, maybe not "
Tell me about yourself.,"Twenty minutes seems long, I wonder what the footbal game will be like. I miss my best friend. I'm glad to be going home next weekend. My own bed. It is lonely when no one is around me. WOnder what my roomate is doing? Why is my floor so quiet right now? I'm glad I don't want to be around anyone right now. I hope clubbing is fun tonight because I do not want to spend my entire year just sitting in Jester. WOnder if I'll transfer next year? I hope I get into the busines school, but at the same time if I don't I have an excuse to leave Texas. I miss Connecticut. Autum wil come soon, why are there no decent trees in Texas? I hate the heat and the desert and the southern accents. I just want to be back in my comfortable bed in Connecticut not in Plano texas. I know I must be upset because I could barely eat at lunch. Why has no one called me today? I call people every day and leave messages, even my parents have more of a life right now. Oh, this is my favorite part of this song. I am gald I decided to put on Dave Matthews while I did this. I wonder if my cats miss me? I bet they miss onnecticut too. I hope I meet some hot guys tonight, that are actually interested in me for once. I hope that my new found friends aren't too good at dancing because I suck and I don't want to look like this awkward fool with my friends dancing amazingly. I am praying that I don't end up grinding with some sketchy boy like last time with out even knowing it. I do not want to feel the penis's of random guys, hey just call me old fashioned but I like to know a guys name, maybe his major. Now I am getting too worried about the thing maybe I should stay at home. No, I will not do this to myself again, I can't this is completely ridiculous. Just because I don't know these people too well doesn't mean that I can hide from the world. how am I going to get know these people better if I don't go and do these things. IHOP was fun last night and I tought it wouldn't be. I am glad I got to sit on the end because everyone else in the middle seemed so squished. I think that I am loosing weight, I should be because I have been eationg a lot less since I have been here. No snacking for me!!! Plus I walk so mcuh. that's cool no freshman 15. But I could do with out the heat. That seems like a little too much for me. It never was that hot in Connecticut. Okay, maybe, but I just miss it up there. All my friends, even though they are at college. I wish it was senior year again. Everything was so much less complicated then. Now I feel as though I will never have everything that I did there. I tried to appreciate it all when I had it, but I didn't appreciate it enough. I had so much and even though I still have the memories I miss it all so much. I know it won't be the same when I go back, but I miss the security that I felt there. I know that this is a learning and growth ex[erience but I do not want to have all this growth I happy with myself and what I was and don't want to change. Maybe if I am lucky I'll be able to graduate in three years. I already have sophomore standing thanks to my wonder ful teachers. I miss Mrs. Jestin and even Dr. Dennis. Why can't I just adjust and love everything? well I guess I just have to keep on doing what I am doing and that is that. all I know is that I will never forget what I left behind. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Ever since I came to Austin about three weeks ago, the way I think has been sort of different than it used to be when I lived in Houston. I feel more free and independent physically and emotionally. Now that I am no longer in high school I feel that I can be my own person and that no one is judging me. The only time I feel like I have to put on a fake persona is when I am around some of the sorority girls in my dorm. A lot of them seem to be superficial like some of the people I knew in high school. Maybe I just care too much about what other people think about me. Hopefully being in the UT environment will change the way I feel. In fact, as I mentioned earlier, I feel that my mind is freer. That makes me really happy. My roommate just walked into the room, and I am really glad she is my roommate. She is probably not someone I would have hung out with in high school, but since I've been hanging out with her for the past few weeks, it makes me wonder what I maybe missed out on as far as friends are concerened in high school. For example, she is a liberal and I am a conservative, which has begun to make me more open-minded in some of my views. I've also realized how much my parents have been an influence in my life. It feels so strange to not see them everyday like I was used to. I think it is good for me though because separating from them is helping me mature and grow emotionally. Overall, I love college life so far because I am discovering myself and learning about different values that I am glad I am becoming familiar with. I am really glad that I am a motivated person who wants to learn and wants to be challenged. It gives me a sense of reward when I accomplish something I have been working hard on. My favorite subject to study is Calculus because it makes me feel content when I complete a homework assignment and I understood what I did. Especially when I learn and apply a new concept. Even if I didn't understand everything I learned, I go to prof or TA and ask them how to do it. Then I understand the concept and I am satisfied with myself. I don't like English, because sometimes I never feel good about what I wrote leaving me with an unsatisfied feeling. I guess I'm just one of those people that feels complete when I conquer a task. But maybe that's how everybody is. Sometimes I base my self-worth on if I did a good job on something or not. Its self-destructing at times because I am a perfectionist and I tend to have expectations too high for myself. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Ever since I can remember, I have always had my friends. There's my best friend, Lisa, and then my other best friends Lindsey and Lexie. Ever since I was a baby, we have always been friends. We have all gone to school together and now we are all attending the same college. Before I found out I had gotten a scholarship to UT, I had been planning to go to Texas A&M. Me and Lisa would go to A&M and Lindsey and Lex would go to UT. Just thinking about splitting up for the first time in our entire lives can still make tears come to my eyes. NOw I will never know how it would have been.   Sometimes I do wonder how it would have been and sometimes I don't care because I'm so happy to still be with them. I realize that they are such a great part of me and my life. We all know each other so well. There is hardly nothing about them that I don't know and there is nothing about me that they don't know. To even say that they are my best friends does not express how much they mean to me. They are more than just friends. I don't know why, but somtimes I can't help but think about how lucky I am to have them. And at the same time, I know I take them for granted. I know that if I ever need anything, anything at all, that I can go to them and they will help me in a way that no one else can. I once heard this poem that simply explains my relationship with my friends. The poem may not be word for word, but I hope it is can better describe just how much I love my friends. First there was one. Then there was two. You came along and then there was three. A circle of friends, no beginning, no end. "
Tell me about yourself.,"so I'm suppose to be writing my thoughts at the current moment. hm, strangely enough, I don't have any and usually my head is swarming with random ideas and daydreams. well, now that I think about it, I guess right now my thoughts are so scattered that I can't exactly grasp onto one idea. my friend called while I was in bio class earlier. stupid me forgot to turn off my phone before I went into the class, so imagine the embarrassment when my phone rang in a deathly quiet lecture hall. I quickly checked the caller id and turned off the phone, not wanting to upset my professor. typically, I'm told, it's not good to piss off the professor during the first day of class. but man, my heart raced after that. I don't know why either. but for about 5 min, I couldn't write; my hand was shaking so bad. so right now, I'm thinking I should call my friend back, but seeing as how I still have about 15 min left to write, I guess I can do that later. speaking of later, I'm still waiting for a phone call from my friend ruby so that we can go work out later. we went earlier this morning, right before lunch, but we had to stop short because I had class and all. we worked out for about an hour, and yet, that was definitely not enough. I never imagined that working out took so long. I'm terrified about the so-called freshman 15 that I want to do as much exercise as possible. it seems like I have so much free time on my hands, since I only have class for about 2-3 hours each day, and yet, I'm still rushing around trying to get everything done. it's funny how time speeds up when you're at college. I still have yet to practice piano here. and I have a billion other things to do, and yet, for some reason, I'm really bored now. my time management skills have definitely got to improve. fast. I also push myself to do something every single minute of the day, because once I start getting bored, then I get really depressed and start missing home. I never thought that would happen because I really hate port lavaca. it was so boring there. man, I'm just filled with surprises. I'm really looking forward to seeing my friend tonight. I can't wait. all my thoughts eventually drift back to him. I've managed to suppress my thoughts about him for about 10 min now. whew, that was really tough work, I must say. we don't see each other all that much during the day, mainly because he's busy, I'm busy, we're all busy. but I guess it's good. we need to lead our own lives, so in case things between us break apart, I won't be totally crushed. like the last time. I learned my lesson quite well. but still, I can't wait to see him. it kinda sucks living at jester without a car. sure I know a lot of people with cars and all, but that's different. I don't want to bother them with taking me places. I had my roommate take me to walmart today and I felt sooooo bad when we came back. I dunno, I just feel like a burden when I don't have a car. I guess I could always call up my bro but he lives about 10 min away and parking on this campus sucks. and usually when I go visit my friend, I get him to pick me up since he lives on the other side of campus and then some. but doing that every day is going to get quite tedious. I'm going to have to find another mode of transportation. I still have to figure out how the buses run too. I'm scared to ride the buses tho. I'm scared that I'll take the wrong one and end up on the 5th ward of austin. I wish I had my car. I've met some new people here, hung out with a lot of old friends too. but yet, I still feel very lonely. I mean, I'm starting to get to know my bro's friends but it's kinda not the same when everyone knows each other so well, and then this newcomer comes and tries to fit in. I guess a lot of freshman go through the same thing. I dunno. maybe it's just me. and wow, this 20 min went by really fast. I have about 4 min left. ok, so what was I saying? o yea, I think tonight I'm going to see my friend. (I told you my thoughts keep drifting back to him) it's his birthday today and his roomies are throwing him a special party, entertainment included. I don't really care about that. and surprisingly enough, I don't even care if he has a bunch of friends that are girls. I guess I'm just in a whatever mode. don't want to get too attached again. but on the other hand, maybe I'm finally beginning to trust him. I guess I'll find out later if that's going to be a huge mistake. I really like writing, esp like this. just random thoughts. I brought up my journal so that when I'm feeling some realy intense emotions, I can just write my little heart out. but that's usually only when I'm really feeling strongly about something. usually when I'm going through one of my personal traumas. ok, time's up. this has truly been fun. truly. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am so excited about being down at UT but now I realize what everyone meant when they said that it is hard to study at UT. I have been out every night this week because there is so much going on. Luckily, I have still kept up with my school work and have been to every class. This week is the only week that I am going to go out every night but I have just had so much fun. There is a guy that I met when I came down here my junior year in high school and we completely hit it off. I am looking forward to seeing him again. I absolutely love the classes that I am taking right now. It is refreshing to go to a class where the students and professors are excited to be there and excited to learn. The material has been interesting and I can't wait to get started in my business honors classes. I am having some roommate problems right now, though. One of my roommates is incredibly messy, stays out all night every night and gets very drunk. I need to talk to her about this problem before it gets too big so maybe I will take her to lunch this weekend. Saturday at the game I get to sit in a box and I am so excited. The last game was fun but it was at night and I was burning up so I can only imagine how an afternoon game would be. Thankfully I will be in air conditioned rooms with free food and drinks. I really like the guy I am going with. Not as a boyfriend but as a really good friend. He is a gentleman and really looks out for me. Last night I met this really cute guy and he kissed me but I found out this morning that he has a serious girlfriend that goes to TCU- what a jerk! I am very mad that he put me in this awkward position. I thought he was so nice and such a gentleman last night but that just goes to show you. You really can not trust freshmen guys- they are only after one thing. I am still getting adjusted to college life and it does take some adjusting. I really do miss my mom and my house. The food at Hardin House is so gross and I hate to eat it. I know that I am going to gain the freshman fifteen. This year is my sisters debutante season and when I go home I am going to have to go to tons of parties and everyone is going to notice that I ahve gained weight and they will all be looking for it. But I have been working out everyday and trying to watch what I eat but there is always candy and good food sitting out around the rooms and I always end up grabbing a handful. But, life is short. Right now I am going to finish this writing and then I am going to study some Spanish and try to start reading Psychology. I am really mad that I am going to miss the first exam but thankfully I will be able to make it up. I am probably going to be missing a lot of class this semester because of traveling. I almost wish I was giving up my title this fall but it isn't until the summer when I give it up. I have enjoyed everything that I have gotten to do and see since I have been Miss Teen of America and all of the opportunities but with going to college and going through rush it has been very overwhelming. I would like to run for President of my pledge class, that would be a great way to get involved in my sorority and to really get to know all of my pledge sisters. I would love to be President of Pi Phi someday just because it is great to be in all sorts of different organizations and be really involved. I haven't gotten involved in anything at UT yet and I am keeping my eyes open for any news about interesting groups and clubs. My neck hurts today and I think it is from carrying my backpack all around. I had to take a bunch of my books back to the Co-op the other day so I got to lug the around. NOT FUN! UT is such a huge school and every little errand takes forever. My sister went here her freshman year and didn't like it so she transfered to TCU, but I love it at UT. I just really feel at home in Austin and I enjoy the diversity of all the people. It really teaches you to be open-minded and not so quick to judge. Coming from Midland, it is a great lesson to learn that people who are not straigt-edge conservative have a lot to offer and teach you, too. Well, the twenty minutes is almost up- that went by really fast. I guess I will go and dry my hair and then get to my reading. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Coming to UT has to be one of the best choices I have made. Living in dobie has to be one of the worst. I wish I would have stayed at one of the honors dorms because the people seem so much more sociable. It seems that this place is extremely cliquish and such. My roommate is cool, although he seems to already have a group of friends here and isn't at all interested in making new ones. I'm a very social person. I have to be in contact with people all of the time or I get severely lonely. I don't like to feel cut off. I wouldn't even stay at my dorm the first night because I didn't have the internet or my cable connected. It is odd how we feel like television, internet, and phones make us feel so connected. I would die now without the internet. I love being able to chat with all of my friends about how they are doing in college. It is so odd being here at UT with so many students from big schools. I'm from such a small school I feel like I don't fit in or I don't know enough. It is odd how being from a small school can make you feel so inadequate at times. I feel like the others have some greater advantage than me. Being at such a big university is such a big advantage. That is why I chose to come here. I really love how much a university this size has to offer. I mean look how awesome the stadium is and the the academic programs. The theater is wonderful and who can top gregory gym?  It is so awesome to be surrounded by so much, but it is also so odd to feel so lonely sometimes. There is so much to do, but not always someone to do it with. I have one friend here with me from school. She is so much more than a friend. She means everything to me but she has hurt me so badly. I don't know if it is possible to overlook what she did to me last october. I can't tell if I could possible love her more than anyone else I'll even incounter, but it really seems possible. How else could you forgive someone so easily for hurting you so bad. She wants to be everything to me and all she wants is for me to say the same. But it is hard to base my life around someone that has thrown my life off balance once. She is such a good person and all she needs is someone to really love her and I really do love her a lot. I hope I can put the past behind us. We are so perfect ogether. We love similar things, yet we are really different. She loves art, I love art. She loves music, I love music. We are passionate about many of the same things. The sexual relationship is so nice too. I like feeling so hot and passionate. Sex is kinda a thing in a relationship that is sybolic of acceptence to me. I mean when I bare myself to someone else it makes me feel good. I feel like we are really together. I've never even been with another girl. I feel like I am so unexperienced but it doesn't matter I guess. If you find someone you are willing to stay with why does it matter how many people you have sex with. I guess it is just society that tells us that we should have many sexual partners before marriage. That is so different from what the church teaches. I really don't agree with much of what the church say about sexual represion and not going with basic instincts or enjoying ones self. I kinda am a member of my own sect of religion. I think that there has to be some supreme authority but how am I supposed to believe that man can concieve this preterhuman figure. It doesn't seem like man should be able to explain the creator and so why try. I think that mans purpose it to better himself and the generation following him. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I kind of feel like my best frined in college station is going to change too much and then we went get along like we use to. we connect so well and can laugh about the stupidest things for hours together. she just rushed and I am not into that kind of thing at all. I went to my first frat party the other night and I did not like it at all. all the girls were skanks and I just stood ther for like 20 minutes and totally did not fit it. I feel like I am kind of figuring out who I am now. in high school you kind of do the cool thing and then act just like everyone else. in college since ther are some manyh people, you can act like yourself and do what you want to. it is kind of weird not knowing who I really am. it is kind of like I put up a false front for the past whatever years. ut is a really cool school. I am not making friends like I wish I were, but I feel somewhat of a tenativness whenever I put in a situation with people I do not know. I am not shy or anything, but things are just kind of different and weird. it is nice trying to find myself or whatever though. I have felt kind of weird lately. I don't think I have eaten enough food during the past week. my appetite is not so keen with the dorm food. the food is not that tasty and I don't want to try any kind of meat substances. I need to get some protein though and shape up. with the long days and heat and all of that stuff, I need to eat better so I can have enougth energy. I get what they mean whenever they say people change whenever they get to college. one of my best frineds who goes to ut and I have not spoken in the last 2 weeks. it is for the better though, I kind of think you can be friends for only so long. I wonder how people can just meet someone in class or in the dorms and immediatley that day or the next go out in the night for me personally, it take s a little longer to get to know someone. my roomate is kind of weird. I expect her to be my best frined and stuff, but it is not like that. I was just thinking of when I told my dad I would never leave him and go to college. I was like five years old when I said that. wow. I feel kind of hurt from a couple of friends. one of them is acting very strang around me and won't tell me stuff about her and her so called boyfriend. I don't understand why she jsut wouldn't talk to me and say he this is what is going on! it is not like I am going to jump on her. I am not a mean person, really I am not. I am just meeting so many people and am faced witht he challenge of deciding who I can confide my secrets and fears in and hwo I can't trust. it is a very tricky situation that can't be dealt with correctly. I am starting to feel kind of tired again. I need that extra energy to get me through the day. there aren't very many interesting things about me, I am jsut like any other regullar person, but I think my personality is pretty cool and can be someting fun to get to know. when I was 3, I ate an entire bottle of childrens chewable tylenol because I thought that they tasted good. I had to go to the emergency room and get my stomach pumped, that is th eone thought that jumps into my head as being the most interesting and unusual. those mattresses in our rooms aren;t that comfotable. in certain places there are areas that are pretty bumpy and lumpy. I guess it is from the other people who stayed in these rooms. I wonder how much they clean and sanitize the rooms inbetween the people who stay in them. I wonder how much of the old persons presence can still be found in the room. my mom insisted on cleaning the room when we got here. pretty werid. she is a clean and neat freak. I guess I get some of that from her. I ahve already found myself cleaning and vaccuming our room two or three times in the last two weeks. I just like things to be clean and I don't like to have a dirty room. my side of the room is usually the cleaner side and my roommate has her stuff all over her bed and stuff. I don't know how come there is not that much light in these rooms. you would think that as a dorm room, there would have to be enought light to study, instead, there isn't nearly enough to wash your face and brush your teeth. my desk kind of sucks. ther is only room for the desk and that is about it. my neck gets tired of looking down at my books on my bed. very bad for you. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now I am very tired, and I really don't know why. I got enough sleep yesterday, but then again I had a very busy day yesterday. It must have been when I went to try out for the texas crew team. I am not sure whether I should join, and it has been bugging me all day. If I join, I will have to sacrifice many things. First off, I would have to get up really early in the morning and I am not use to that. Second, time would be another sacrifice. I would have less time to do other things,  and would have to learn how to manage my time very efficiently. I am really missing the girl that I left back home in order to come attend the university. She was so good to me, never complaining and always doing things for me, even if it was at her expense. We got along great, hardly ever fighting. I miss going to her house every day and talking to her and her parents. Her parents were really good to me also. This girl was going through a really hard time in her life when I met her. I am greatful that I was a big part in helping her get through this time in her life. That time was when her parents were getting divorced. She got through it fairly well, but then her mom remarried quickly. This upset her a great deal. I enjoyed the fact that I could be there for her when she needed me. As a result of her mom's remarriage, she now has a new stepsister and stepfather. Her stepsister is really making her life tough. For that, I resent her stepsister. She disobeys her father and stepmother, steals my girl's clothes, and is a big slut. This girl is named Emily. Emily really pisses me off a great deal. Why does she have to be that way. Nobody has done a damn thing to her, but yet she seems to make the lives if the people around her miserable. I think about my girl quite often, but I know that I am up here for the reason of getting an education. I don't know whether I should move on and try to find someone new, or hold off and just visit her when I am home. But while I am in Austin, the main thing to concentrate on is my studies. It seems that my classes are going to be somewhat difficult. At first I was bit scared, but I know I can come out on top if I put the work and time in. It is sometimes hard to manage time between working out, studying, and having a good time. But it can be done. I am slowly learning the things necessary to become a good student here at UT. I plan to do the best that I can possibly do, and hopefully, if god is willing I will make it through alright. Wow, it has already been twenty minutes and I've got to make a class. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am sitting here on my bed in my dorm room. It is 11:15 at night  on a  wednesday. My friend is sitting here with me and we are about to watch the movie  Go. We just came back from brians room where we watched Pulp Fiction. My foot  kinda itches. I feel like I ate too much today. I am mad at myself because I  smoked two cigarettes today and I don't usually smoke unless I drink alcohol,  but it was fun anyway. I really hate to read and study, I would so rather go  out and party or even just hang out with people. I kinda feel like I get behind  because I am a slow reader and I can't comprhend all of the information in one  sitting. I keep losing concentration. I really want a rug in my room. I just  boiled some water to make coffee for suzanne and I . I am really gald I don't  do drugs or deal them. I kinda have a headache. I am really stressed out right  now about getting all of my work done. I need to find two monologues by friday,  type them up and read the plays they come from. I really want to be a good  successful actress when I graduate from collge and move back to LA. I know it  doesn't look like I wrote a lot but I am just ti "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now as I am witing this paper I am thinking about wether I should go to class today or if I would be okay if I did not go at all. If I do notgo it will be okay becasue I can read in my book and then just go to si and still do fine, but I do have a mid term on the 20th in my psychology class which could pose a problem that will be in seven days on next monday. I have to start studyning and reading or I will not get the gpa I need to transfer into thw business schopol. I do not even know why I want into that shcool so badly I thinkthat it is mainlky because of the repect that schoo,l demands. where as the liberal arts schol is more of the blow off lazy person school for peopl who want to be Managers of local McDonalds. Ohh and I have some bills to pay today. I wish I was rich and could aford all the things I wanted without material wants I believe my life woud be a lot easier than it is right now. IF I had all the money than I would have no stress. Without stress I can relax and enjoy life. I know that people sa that money is the root of all evil and money will never make you haooy, and I believe in this 100%. but I do believe that if I were to have enough money to live comfortably and get anything with in reason that I would be beter off. I am talking with my girlfriend of almost 10 months right now and she is distracting me from my work by talking to me and arguing with me about different things. We have an over all good relationship nd very rarely argue. this is mainly because she has a very low self esteem and will not stand up for herself inan argument. I onn the other hand am very cnfrontational and when something is not good with kme I will let the people it involves know. Where she will not. I like her a lot and so do al my friends and parents, but sometimes I have considered especially after three weeks of coleg what it would be like to be single again and able to date many people. I somewhat miss it, but at the same time do not I think for now I will stay with my girlfriend. I just thought I ave to call my stors manager and report one of my fellow employees. He is stealing product from the store, and there is a big reward if someone reports him and he is found guilty. I think he will be found guilty, but I am wondering wether or not I made the right decision in turnign himin, but thne again I could get up to $5000. So since I am there to make mone not friends I think I am making he right decision. Wle finally my twenty minutes is oming to a close this is a hard assignent it is hard to think and write in conjunction. I am not used to this since I hae never kept a diary or anything ike that, I guess for those that have kept a diary this assignment is a simple one. well there it is all done. Bye "
Tell me about yourself.,"I wonder if my parents are coming to visit me this weekend because I need a lot of things. In fact I need a lot of things. I hope this creating stuff really works. O yeah, that math 408c class seems really intimidating. I wonder if I can really get through because I was struggling through the review session today. Well, at least  tomorrow is friday. thank god. I need a major break. it is funny because I really and honestly want to achieve so much yet I feel so far behind from where I think I need to be. I'm just falling falling far behind. I must get back into shape and into the jist of things. I seriously need a massage. My legs are killing me. I must have walked ten thousand miles today. only 4 months left to go. great. that pennebaker professor seemed pretty cool. I don't think I want to drop that class because it is so hard to get into but it also seems like it will be interesting. I have never taken a psychology course. ba101 can wait. I wonder how all my friends are doing back home. do they miss me?  probably not. I have been here for a week almost. I have met some new people but not as many as I should have. too bad. well, we still have a long time. I think I should join some clubs but I don't know where. hmmmm. this song sucks. I can't wait until friday. I miss everyone I knew. it sounds strange but I really miss them. I need to work out some more. I feel so tired. but I am really surprised I am not  homesick. though I do miss the food. I can live like this. it seems pretty fun even though I don't have a car. I think my dad and my brother went bowling. I feel so sleepy. I miss playing the piano and the guitar. I came here to escape a lot of things but it seems that the distance has brought me closer to what I wanted to get away from. lucky for me there are a lot of distractions because sometimes I find myself thinking about somebody more than I should. I don't deserve this. why does this sound so depressing?  let's t hink happy thoughts. that girl van that I met today seemed pretty cool. really very outgoing and even waited for me after class. that's pretty cool. I am glad I have dan as a roommate. his sense of humor is always there. I feel like playing basketball but I need to catch up with schoolwork already. the sad things is that it is the second day only. I can't believe I have the same 2 classes with tyson, some guy I met at camp. what are the chances of that?  and Lira my second cousin was in my economics class. so is angela johnson from my old high school. but the professor. well  nevermind. so many memories. time to make some new ones. should I call my parents tonight. yea I t hink I will. dang I still have to do that calculus homework. I hope it is not that long. I need to do a lot of reading too. for mis 310 so I can get caught up. well the good thing is that my day is over at lunch time. yay!!!  but dan is going back to houston and leaving me all alone. so many th ings to do so little time. but I love the ut experience. I really do. hookem horns. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I have just finished reading the second chapter of the psychology textbook for class today. My room mate is always playing spades on the internet. I type very loudly. My subwoofer speaker system really looks cool the way I have it set up on my desk. This is a very odd, but interesting, assignment. The combination of the fan and air conditioner noise is driving me crazy. It is like the drone of a prop-plane. My computer is constantly checking for viruses and is always making little ""engine"" noises while I am typing. My room mate has a very odd way of typing. As I am doing this assignment, I am hearing myself talk the words as I type. I am sure that I have always done this, however, until now I have not noticed it. I believe that I just heard thunder. we could use the rain. I can't believe that we had a pop test in spanish today. I have a knot in my stomach. I know that I did poorly on it. I have a great spanish resource. my 501 verbs book. My monitor also makes a noise that sounds like I would imagine electical energy to sound. I want to go home this weekend. I miss my brother. I am going to bring him to Austin sometime to hang out with me and see the sights of UT. What time is it?  I wonder if my package has arrived in the mail room, yet?  I wonder what my dad thinks of all of my difficulties with the percussion ensemble here?  I would like to retreat to Lake Tahoe and bask in the glory of the crystal clear water and the Sierra Nevadas. That was a very random thought. All of the intricacies of the human brain are very amazing. If my cardiothoracic surgery bid does not work out, maybe neurosurgery could be an option. I have never had a class quite like psychology 301. I like the fact that it is web based. If I happen to miss a class, it is relatively easy to track down what was discussed. And even if the web doesn't have the information, the study sessions should cover the material again. I wish that I would have attended the first study session. I wish that I hadn't signed up for the molecular biology honor society. my plate is full already. That is such a strange idiom. I wonder how it came about. I wonder if idiom is the correct term for that expression. I have a very nice printer. It's fast, silent, and very clean looking. I am definitely a strange guy to be admiring his Deskjet!  I had to buy a lot of books for my spanish class. It has turned out to be my hardest class. I do not think that I am going to take any more spanish after this semester. I don't think that I was truly prepared to take spn312k, but I must have guessed well on the Wisconson test. I hope that my friend Cory does well at Rutgers this weekend. I can hardly believe that he was the number one defensive pick in the nation. It seems like just the other day when we were playing together for Cunningham Middle School. Now the guy is 6'5"", 245lbs. !  I really enjoy football and I miss the contact, but my I'M experience this fall should be a lot of fun without all of the bruises. I really want to lift weights tonight, but I don't believe that I will have time. I also want to train with Daniel, but I don't know what he has planned for tonight either. It feels like I have been thinking for hours, but It has only been a few minutes. This definitely reinforces the fact that the mind is better than any computer mankind can build. At least until some sort of artificial intelligence comes along. And even then, that won't compare because ""artificial"" is in the name. I really hope that my timer goes off soon and I can stop writing. I think that it would be really cool if I could guess the exact time the buzzer will sound without looking at the clock. It would be like ESP. That reminds me of a kid who did a debate over the existence of ESP in fifth grade gifted/talented class. It makes me feel good to say that I have been identified G/T. That's very cocky sounding, but I don't believe that I have told anyone of my identification in years. I have a problem with cockyness. I had better watch out or someone or something is going to come along and put me to shame in embarrasing fashion. "
Tell me about yourself.,"This week has been so overwhelming!  I have taken in so much and my mind feels like it is in overdrive. I already feel stress and the semester has barely begun. I want to be involved in a many ways as I possibly can, but there are so many organizations to join, I don't know what to choose. The difference between college and high school is readily apparent. I hope as time goes by, I will develop better study habits and get used to waking up early. I am extremely nervous about the first exam in all of my classes because I do not know what kind of questions the professor will ask, and therefore, do not know how to prepare for them. Tonight I am glad that I get to go out and do something because I feel so couped up here in this dorm room studying all week. I am also excited about seeing my boyfriend and cousins this weekend. Everytime he calls, I light up with happiness. No matter what kind of day I am having, I always feel better when he calls. I still miss my ex very much though. Two years is hard to let go of especially when they have been your friend for an even longer period of time. I wish he would just call me because I really want to talk to him. We used to talk every night for hours and hours. He was such a big part of my life and now I barely see him, let alone talk to him. I think that he is mad at me because I am dating someone else, but I'm not sure. He usually returns my calls, but I have not talked to him in like 4 days. I am really hungry and I would love a big bowl of icecream. but I can't have one. I am really trying to stick to this stupid diet because of all of the ""freshman 15"" horror stories. I wish I had more time to take a nap during the day, but when I'm not studying, I'm working out or running errands. Another thing I'm worried about is having two finals on one day. My mythology and calculus finals are right after one another and they are both very demanding courses. Oh well, I guess I just have to make the best of it because there is nothing I can do about it. Thank god I don't have three on the same day--then, I would really panic. I'm thankful to have Julio because he really pushes me and encourages me when  I am doubtful or discouraged. I miss him so much more than I thought I would. I have only been with him for a month, but I already feel attached. I hope my parents like him when they meet him this weekend. Hes so smart and has good manners. Their approval means a lot to me and I guess Ill find out what they think of Julio this weekend "
Tell me about yourself.,"I just got back from Houston and all I can think about is getting ready for this week's classes. I had a good time witj my girlfriend and got to spend quality time with my parents. I hope I can get tickets to the Bob Dylan concert next week. I need to study a lot this week so I can keep on top of my classes and not get behind in anything. Thursday night I hope I go to Bob Popular's again. I'ts fun not having Friday classes so I can go out on Thursday nights . I love college: I feel so free; free as a bird: to come and go as I please. I'm doing pretty well in my classes thus far and hope to continue on. UT football dominated Stanford. They didn't have a chance. However my favorite college football team is PennState. They whipped Arizona last week and killed Akron this week -70-24. Now they have their eyes set on Miami in two weeks : and I plan to go on-line and bet about $20 on that game: in psu's favor of course. Hopefully they will win the national championship. I also hope that UT does well because they are my second favorite team. I really need my 4. 0 Gpa this term so I can get into the business school. I don't know what I will do if I don't get in. I am really interested in studying business and hope to own my own business someday. God I miss my girlfriend: I've only been away from her for like ten hours now but I already realize that I miss her so much. We've been going strong now for like a year and a half, and I love her so much. She's still a senior in high school and I hope that next year she will come to UT. She makes good enough grades so I think she can get in. Sometimes I miss my parents but I'm having a good time thus far. I I have made so many friends. Ut is going to kill Rutgers this weekend : but too bad it is in New Jersey. I want to watch them play live since I missed their game last week cause I was back home in Houston. however I did watch them on T. V . So here I sit on this computer at 11:25 typing and typing staring off into space. I wish I knew what would happen in my future, I wish I knew. Who knows : its all in God's hands now. He is the one who will watch over me and guide me on the right path. I am taking creatine while I work out. Since I started taking it I've gained 10 pounds of muscle. It might be bad for me in the long run but for right now its worth it "
Tell me about yourself.,"Now I am doing the stream of consious assignment for psy. class. It's wierd because I usually don't think this way, boy I am glad that Rachel Fair is one of my good friends, I mean I thought there was no way that we would ever keep up after highschool, but right now we talk everyday I am sitting here at my desk wondering if Mer will call I really had a wonderful time with her on Mon I have thought of her kissing my ear several times sense she did it when we were in the man I wish my sweetmates would pipe down how often is it that when you break up you spend more time with the girl you broke up with than before crazy huh. Well I wish that I could see mer right now she would be so nice to hug and hold close and feel her tightly pressed against me and then I would feel back in highschool I think that bucs is going to be a good fraternity for me to join zube seems to be a great leader I think that he really has a great heart or the lord it's been 10 min so I hope that I am getting close to the timelimit I tried to due the dang survey but my computer locked up towards the end so it didn't count any of the work that I did which completely blows  I am really secretly attracted to shannon across my hall she has the most carefree attitude its so infectious I can't help but be relaxed when around her plus she is hot today matt said that he knew that she wanted me so I thought that was pretty cool I wish that when I went to my mailbox there would be something from someone I am tight with everytime I love my mom I know that most guys my age have a pretty bad relationship with their parents so it's diffinitely strange to be as close to mine as I am I love the fact that my parents are starting to trust me and give me space I love this song on the cd inx is the best I just wish that he wouldn't have killed himself to try and show that he was a talented musician I will never understand those that feel they have to kill themselves to get respect I really can't believe that I am having trouble in calc class when I have already had the class that's crazy I saw sarah today which was cool because I gave her a really big scare "
Tell me about yourself.,"Why do I have this pimple? Why does it matter what people look like so much? I am sure that if we were all turned in inside out, and what was inside of us was on the outside, well first of all, we would look pretty damn disgusting, but if who we were was on the outside of our body, the world would be better. I am sure that there wouldn't be as many people wanting to show off their ""body"", because their new ""body"" would be who they were, and not everyone is happy with who they were. I went to my first college frat party last night, and it was one of the worst nights of my life. My best friend and I had this inclination to go there and do nothing but talk to people. He has a girlfriend, and I just didn't want to meet a girl there for other than friends purposes. It was HORRIBLE. It was crowded as heck, the music was too loud, so that in order for anyone to even understand you, you had to use a megaphone, and to be socially ""accepted"" you had to have a beer in  your hand. Now, one might think that would be an excuse, but I didn't see, but 15 out of at least 200+++++ without a beer. For some reason, I want to spell beer, bear, but don't let me please. Thanks. :o) Well, it was so dumb. My best friend and I walked around the whole time just walking, because in this one room, the music was so damn loud you had to use a megaphone to talk to people, and I'm not all about that. I am not the stud who has all the looks, but can't talk to people worth a damn. It doesn't matter though, if you are that stud, because the girl is too busy dreaming about your looks that she doesn't give a poop what you are saying. I am more a people person. I like to make people laugh. I don't do it on purpose, like go out of my way to make people laugh, but it's the way I am. I have this quirkiness (thanks Sooze) about me, but I love it. I don't want to be that stud that can't talk, because I am pretty happy with myself, until last night, when I had this feeling going into this party that girls in general had changed. My whole life, I have been nice, and I go by the saying ""Nice guys finish last"". I had this feeling that it might all change in college, but the answer is ""nope"". I was at my friends house, and her roommates were all telling me that it had changed, and that girls now were looking for long lasting relationships, and they didn't want all that highschool bullshit that they had gone through before. Okay, I know this sounds superficial, but these weren't bad looking girls either. Two were pretty darn cute, and the third wasn't too bad at all, so it isn't that the (excuse me god for saying this) more ugly girls were saying this, but they were girls that you would classify as pretty hot and tempting. I hate using the word ugly, and I hate judging people. I don't. I always hear my friends going up, and saying ""Aaron, how in the hell does that guy have that beautiful girl, when he is so damn ugly"". Okay, first of all, I am thinking that they are jealous, but evenso. Why? Why does it matter what he looks like? Why can't he be a  nice guy, who finally beat the system, and found himself a gorgeous girl that appreciates who he is. How he treats her. What he does for the world. What is up with this world? I NEVER say that shit, because there is no reason for it. I hate saying ""oh, he is ugly"" and just making fun of people in general, because if you look at me, I am not the best looking guy on campus, and I have no right in heck to say that. I HATE HATE when my friends say it. But, it's the world. College was supposed to be different. The time for me (the outgoing quirky boy) to make some friends, and go out and have fun. It hasn't quite been that, and granted, I have only been here for a couple of days, but I am scared. I am scared that it is going to be like this for the rest of the year. I mean, I go out and meet people, but I don't know when or how to ask for their number, because it's just too weird in my eyes. We say when we leave ""See  you around"", but have you realized the size of this campus. It's freakin' amazing. There are 50,000 students here, and it is atrocious as to how big this school is. It was supposed to be different. I mean, don't get me wrong, I don't have 12 eyes, and I have all my teeth, but it is still the same as in high school. I get befriended by the girls, which honestly is fine with me, because well, maybe it isn't. Maybe it would be nice to be gawked over for once, and maybe it would be nice to be wanted by a few girls here and there, but as of yet, it hasn't really happened. It's not that I am looking at all, because I am in love with Sooze, but it would be nice to have that feeling that when I walk into a room, people stare. I promise you this. if who we were was what we looked like on the outside, I would get those stares. Thank you for your time. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well all I can think about at the moment is how stressful college is and why we have so much work to do. I don't understand it at all and I am very stressed out at the moment. highschool seemed so much easier but I know that it is something that I need to get used to. on top of it all I have so much sorority things to do. we have so many meetings and assignments to do on top of all of our school work. I just want to sit in my room and sleep because I am not feeling well. also I miss my parents. eventhough they are fifteen minutes away I am missing them but when I get around them they annoy me so bad. I don't understand it. I am difinately looking forward to our weekend because I know that our pledge retreat will be so much fun. especially becauase I cannot wait to get to know my pledge sisters. it will be awesome. I feel disconnected from so many of the girls and I know that they are feeling the same way. we seem to go out with the same people every weekend when there are fifty other girls that we still haven't really gotten the chance to meet. I really miss my friends from home a lot. especially jenna. but I know that she is having a blast at tech with kristi. the dorm is awfully quiet tonight. more so than usual. it is very weird not to hear people running up and down the halls screaming at the top of their lungs. it's actually very nice. I probably won't be able to sleep because I am so used to the noise. sleep also sounds really nice. I feel like I haven't done it in a year. now that I am sick I know that sleep is very important but who has time for sleep when there is a million other things to do in life. I also need to do laundry sometime in the next century before I run out of socks to wear. I think my mom said she was going to buy me some new socks this weekend but I never saw those. I wish it would just rain so then I would have an excuse to just sleep all day long. sleeping during a storm is so awesome. it feels so comforting. this is really weird just writing about random things. I feel like I am talking into a recorder or something or just having a really weird dream. actually I feel delirious just looking at all of the random thoughts that go through my mind. I feel like it's deep thoughts by jack handy. if you ever evaluate what you think about it funny to think that ""we always sweat the small stuff and it's all small stuff. ""  my dad loves that quote and he also reminds me of it. when I went to the doctor today he was writing down random quotes on the hospital bed paper about college and lecturing me about school. it was really annoying. oh well he was a very old man anyways. he told me never to forget those quotes and of course I already did. what does he expect of a busy girl like me. crazy people. well my time is up. I wish I could type faster so I would have more to say but this is it. random thoughts by Kristen Garcia. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Every moment I am conscious of my physical self. it is like I have existed so long strictly within my mind that I have never really felt the sun touch my skin. I suppose I am excruciatingly aware of my body now that I realized I actually have one. Lately it feels like I am rediscovering the familiar. I have always walked down the street. but never been aware of things like others faces, the noise of traffic, the heat, the breeze, the color of the sky. I have always lived in this alternate universe. i see only enough of the physical world to avoid collisions. and I live in my head, in my thoughts, in my music and art. I almost never come out. But lately I have opened my physical eyes. Some of the things I have seen are things I could have done without. I'm not so sure I like it out here with the other people. I feel myself retreating again. I feel that small talk is a waste of breath. Any words outside my poetic code are words wasted. Any utterance that is not a song is a waste of voice. And I am trying to figure out why people NEED people. I have lived inside myself for a long time. I can make it through the monotony of every day life (hint: that's where the ACTING MINOR comes in). but maybe it would be more lucrative to just live down in here. And I wonder what is really ""being productive"". My mother said that I wasted my summer by being in love with someone who ended up not loving me in return. I feel that love is not a waste of time. If it is then what real purpose or function do we have in this bleak world. Of course, now with my heart blown away I feel a bit sad. But I meant it when I gave my love to this boy. I meant every word, every breath, every touch. And I guess that MY time wasn't wasted. his was. HIS time was wasted because he remained too long with someone he did not love. My time was not wasted. And now. let me push all memories of this love deep down into the corners of my soul. Right now this grain of sand irratating every pore in my body. but maybe a pearl will result. A song. A painting. Blah. Blah. Maybe I can once again transform the pain in my life into something pur-tee. Man, someday all of this shit that I have passed off and forgotten through my art and songs is going to resurface and say ""Hey! We are still here. "" and that is going to break me and FINALLY I will no longer have creativity to turn to because I won't trust it anymore. Gee. Something to look forward to. And this girl came up to me today on the first day of classes. She said I looked ""alone"" and invited me to her church where ""everyone is a family and god is clearly present"". Funny that she noticed I was alone and I didn't. I wanted to tell her that I would never fit into her christian bubble world. oh yeah, I live in a bubble world myself all right. but its a different kind altogether. Maybe I should invite her for a visit in MY bubble world. But. heh. i meakly gave her my number. i was in a way touched by her gesture and even though I oppose religion. who knows? I may go just to laugh at the SHEEP and. well. mEDITATE. And plus. it would probably light up this nice girl's life. Aww. It would also be cool to go someplace and have everyone be really happy to see you. I wonder if it would be wrong for me to go in order to reap these benefits. especially since there is NO CHANCE in my conforming to a religion. Hmm. It seems like I have been given the opportunity to explore some areas of my life that I have suppressed in the past. Certain tendencies. I guess I am really scared when it comes to this. I am afraid maybe of what I might find out if I try it. I mean. i have finally admitted to myself that these thoughts are frequent and substancial. But I don't want the course of my life to change that drastically. Right now I long for both but am happy with one. If I try the other and realize that it is so much better than the other and begin wanting only IT then I will have to do some major changes in my life and identity. But it might NOT be good. Or I might continue liking both equally. Which could also cause problems. Sheesh. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I guess right now I would be feeling on edge, or wary. It is on rare occassion that I have ever written an essay that will not be judged by the firm establishment of concrete details, which are followed by commentaries. I worry about everything, though. I worry about this class. What will the tests be like? Am I studying enough? How many times should I review the material? I know that it is better to ""overlearn"" something, but in doing so, I think I will go crazy. I try to review my material everyday. at the same time, though, there is always something new to read on top  of the previously assigned work. I cannot convert into a complete ""bookworm"" because I would not be at ease with myself. I need time to relax and just chill with my friends. It is almost a set system that I have with myself that I read as much as I can, and then I go to smoke a cigarette to calm and relax my nerves. It's kind of ironic that the thing I reward myself with will probably lead to my demise someday. at this very moment, I have a killer soar throat. from what, I have no idea. It's not the kind of sore throat from yelling, but more along the lines of say. strep throat. I'm going to be royaly ticked if it is because I hate being sick. I love to be in control of my life, but when you're sick, it's hard to accomplish because you can't help the way you feel exept by doping up with medicine that makes you drowsy. Yes, I am aware of DAYquill, but it has such a bad taste. Gross. it does work, though. hopefully what I have is just a bug that will pass like the one hour fever I had the other day. I was burning up. The only medication that was available to me was ibuprofrin. I took two of those and layed down with a cool towel on my head. like five minutes later, an officer from the HBSA called to invite me out to eat. I really wanted to go, but I couldn't drag myself out from under the security of my blankets. it really kinda bothered me that I couldn't go because I want to be able to be as involved as I can in any organization that I join. I felt as though I had let some small opportunity pass me by. it was just dinner,though, and we had another meeting today. Thursday, I will hosting for apple computer at the HBSA company night. I think that this is going to be a great opportunity, but I need to do some ""boning"" up on the apple company before I speak with any of the recruiters. of course, I will have to do this tommorrow, which is also when I have four classes, and which is also the day that I promised a friend that we would go work out together. so much to do, so little time. just last night I was talking to this guy, or one of my friends, or someone, about how amazing it is that our brains can compute so many different emotions at one time. From everything I have mentioned, I have experienced feelings of happiness, curiosity, stress, and even confusion. somehow, it seems that I am able to confuse myself about lots of things, the way words are spelled, if I really could have done something or not, or even where I stand in life. weeks before I came to ut, it seemed like I had a firm grip on life. I had a group of friends that I partied with all the time, and while I knew that wouldn't last, the end came too soon. while I still have my ties, I now stand at one of the most awkward times in my life. ut has so many different kinds of people, and while it easy to meet a lot of them, especially if you smoke, we all have this feeling inside that constantly ponders, ""What am I doing with  myself?"" I know that these will be some of the most important years of my life because I am  ""building"" myself, but I don't think I can completely be myself yet, because I don't know ""completely"" who that is. if anyone asks you for advice, don't say, ""Be yourself. "" I'd say that half of the people at this school don't know who that is. in any case, I need to go smoke. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Being at cllege is a new experience for me and I think that it is giving me  a sence of being dependant on myself. I like all the new freedom that I have  gotten, but I also am homesick a lot. I miss my parents and being in my house  in Houston. There isn't anyone to make sure that I do everything that I am  supposed to do. I am a person that does not get stressed out a lot, ut now that       I am in college and having to take care of everything on my own, I am  getting worried and that is gettting me scared. I have a lot of thing s that I  need to get accomplished and don't have time for it. It makes me very  frustrated and annoyed at the same time. I feel like I should be a lot more  organized and up to date with everything. I am a very organized person, even a  ""neat feak,"" and that is why it's driving me crazy when I am behind. I think  that if I work hard, then I will do alright.       Last weekend, I went home and visited my friends and family and it felt so  good to be home. I was able to go driving around and I knew where everything   was, and that feeling of being in control was great. think that I just need  time to settle into UT, and then I will be in more control. Austin is never  going to be ""home"" for me, but it will be a place that I can come to enjoy. I  don't think that any city can compare to Houston because that is where I grew up  and that's also where I have all of my family and friends.       Sometimes I think about how life would be like if I was adopted or even if  one or both of my parents were dead. I look back and don't think that I could  manage. My parents play a very important role in my life and I don't think that  I would be the same person that I am without them. I know a lot of people that  have parents that have passed away and they have really gone through some rough  times and they are doing well now, and I give them so much strenght and poer for  being able to do that. If my mother would pass on, I think that I would really  go into a state of depression, and would go trough a transformation, in that I  would become very quiet when usually I am very outgoing and lively. Many things  don't affect me unless they are very close and dear to my heart. I usually  don't cry in movies, and I don't care to become very emotional all the time. I  have too much pride to cry infront of people other than my family. No matter  how depressing the news, I am unable to show my emotions. That is something  that I think that I get from my parents, specifically my mother. I think that I  have gotten a lot of my qualities from my mother and most of my physical  qualities from my father. I think that I am able to be the person that I am  because of my parents. They helped shape me into the person that I am.       There are friends that I have been close to in high school, and ever since  I have come to UT, I have not been as close to. I don't know the reason for the  change, other than the fact that our schedules are conflicting and that we have  not tried as hard to keep in touch. I have heard that things like this happen  and that you make all of your really good friends in college. I know what  people say, but I have a really good friend at Trinity and me and her have keep  in touch really well. I think that she is an exception to the ""rule. ""                               "
Tell me about yourself.,"okay, well to start off, I'm really not sure or confident of how my experience here at UT will effect me. ""will I succeed, or fail, only time will tell"", I really have a hard schedule for my first semester, a lot of memorizing, which I can do, but just don't want to put that much effort. Sound like I'm a no brainer, but if I have to do it ""ill do it"", that doesn't mean I want to. my goal is to have a midrange of a 3. 5 to 4. 0 avg. but right now I'm right this short writing assignment for Psy. and I reallly just can't seem to expand my thoughts on the consccious, I guess it's because the prompt says, think spontaneously, but how the hell do I do that if I'm under pressure. excuse my language. but just thinking spontaneously. well I really like this prompt, because there is no right or wrong answers and its just basically a written expression of how one's mind works. I'm not trying to kiss up or anythin, but really I do enjoy this. I would have hoped though, that the class would be a little smaller, so I could ask questions freely and not feel bothered, but that's no excuse I guess, what kind of reputation will I have amongst 50,000 people. Well my goal, is to continue doing well academically and also create a good social life. becoz I can't just study and have no fun, that's not in my domain. I've never had stress before, but I might break that barrier this semester. first day of class was pretty cool, because the professor , mr. peddebaker was pretty funny, and I hope I spelled his name right. anyway its a nice experience. I wonder how long it will take me to study for biology, thats probably my toughest class, coz I don't really enjoy it. I loved it at first, but then I took AP Biology in high school, and my teacher made it so much work, and I didn't reallly get to enjoy it. it was not a fun learning experience. well it's been ten minutes, and ten more to go I'm really counting down dnow. I just say that click once to submit button ( click just onece on submit when you are done)  right now I'm watching this girl, while I type, write the longest email I've ever seen, and on lmy left that girl's writing one too,  god, don't they have somethin better to do? wrong statement, I was judging them, the truth is I probably write more emails then them. that 's because I lived in three different places less than thrree years. Los angeles for 13 and dallas for 2, and austin for one month. I'm movin like a train. but. well I forgot what I was going to write, ooopos oh well, I just got off my spanish class, and that profesor was pretty cool, although I understood his spanish better than his english. but it was still enjoyable. I want to join a fraternity, but I'm afraid I wont have time to do my schoolwork. but I still want to be social and everything like that, I guess is just another decision to think upon. oh my god, this girl stopped writing her email! the lab must be closing, nope, its not , just being sarcastic well I've got exactly five more minutes and I'm officially done with my first college assignment. I wonder how many words I've written,  babbling on and on is something I could do. well I just got a new neighbor in the lab, she's pretty cute, I wonder if I should talk to her,  naaaaa, seeems to involved with what shes about to do, oh well, maybe ill see her around, yeah right!, in this place no way. man I wish this one girl went here, Lindsay, she was my high school crush, she was a good friend of mine but I never really asked her out or anythin, I thing she was dating someone at the time, oh wel, thats why I got to be aggressive over here, its a fresh new start. two more minutes left, well I just had to rub my nose it was itching, and fix my hair. well I got one minute maybe ill start on the other assignment, but I don't know how long that would. done "
Tell me about yourself.,"Today is Labor Day. This weekend I went to my family reunion in Noccona, TX. My cousin, Tracey, is recently engaged. I am extremely happy for her, but at the same time, I am a little bit jealous. I know I am not actually ready for marriage, but it seems so exciting to me. My brother has been married a little more than four years. When he first married, I did not think too much about it. Now, it makes me just a little envious that he has someone to be with all the time. My parents have been married 31 years!  I cannot believe it. In today's world where divorce is a commonplace, I am proud of my parents for sticking together. My parents, about four years ago, agreed to let me have a Yorkie. Her name is Brittnay, and I love her with all of my heart. I was able to see her this weekend, which was so nice. I think I miss her more than anyone else, probably because I get to talk to other people on the phone. Brittnay is the sweetest little princess, and I cannot wait until I see her again. College life is so much different than high school. I t is funny how one grade level (from a senior in high school to a freshman is college) can make such a difference. I really do not feel older. For some reason, I always feel young. When I think about all the petty gossipy things I worried about in high school, it makes me laugh. Once people enter college they change so much. For instance, I have a friend that used to treat girls really badly, but now he is a sincere and honest guy. However, some people change for the worst, which is very unfortunate. I am really concerned about my grades. I really do not know what to expect, as far as exams go; therefore, it is hard to know what to focus on. I want to be a child psychologist. Psychology has always interested me, but the past year, it really has made an impact on me. I love children, and I also love helping people. I figured child psychology was a good way to put the two together. When I become a mom, I want to have a private practice and only work in the mornings. This way, I can spend lots of time with my own children. I also want to make fancy dinners for my husband every night. If I worked all day, I do not think I would have time. This summer I started cooking, and I found that it is quite enjoyable. It is such a good feeling to work hard making something and then share it with others. I would like to take cooking classes sometime during my college years. I also need to find a job. I did not realize how much money college consumes. I feel bad asking my parents for money. Plus, I worked at The Pottery, a local shop in Midland, for a little more than a year, so I am not used to needing money from my parents. My mom and my dad taught me how to manage my monwy. I love my parents/family very dearly. They are the sweetest, kindest, most caring people that I have ever known. My family is also very generous. I just hope that I will turn out to be the kind of people they are. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Simply amazed that someone has seen to it that I make it this far without more than what I have experienced that is comparable to adrop in the bucket considering that sometimes I could give a damn about what is best for me for the simple fact that I'm in it for the everything I can get only at times it's entirely too much to compute at once. boy, where has the trrain of thought gone to? Maybe it left to another place out of sight but never to be out of my mind becaause it seems to me that I'm already there. I suspect that everyone else is in their own way. that's why we are told everyone is ""special"" when we ae too young too know exactly what that means. I'm glad payed attention that day. Uh oh. here it comes again. jealousy rears it's ugly head signaling for the dogs who are  no less guilty of the crime than the one they persecute with their fingers crossed in vain hope wanting our hero to sacrifice his integrity for ideals of what was considered to be right by those who were so afraid of what it was they were dealing with that they confined themselves to an ignorant prejudice. well them fools can stay there and pray they never realize exactly what they're missing until it has already become a haunting unidentifineable thorn in their calloused side. Brains bruised with ignorance rather than blessed with memories of the world they restricted themselves from and feared to the day they wished they had not been such pussies. I cannot pity them, I have no time to devote thought to their rancid exsistence. I have my own to look after. I'm here know and those who would seek my friendship will have it. and those who seek my love will find it. and those who desire my trust and confidence shall not betray it or I shall strike down upon them with the fury of a thousand chained hatred's fire until their very soul. "
Tell me about yourself.,"well, I don't really know where to begin. it's my 3rd week of school and I guess it's going okay. my classes are getting harder but I suppose I'm getting into the ""rountine"" of things. i don't know wether I'll go to the ISA meeting today cause I know what kind of peeps will be there but I am definetely going to the SSA meeting. i think that'll be a really fun club cause of the people that are in it. the social this saturday should be cool. i havne't called mom today so I should do that before I leave for the meeting. on friday, I am finally going to meet this girl that I haven't seen ever since freshman orientation. i have so much stuff to tell her. that's one of the things that I really hate about college. that it's so hard to make plans with people. and that you can only catch them at certain times cause no one's in their room all the time. damn, we have this cricket in our room right now and I don't know where it is. i've tried looking for it so many times but I can't find it. it keeps chirping every now and then, sort of letting us know that it's still there. haha. ti's so annoying cause at night the little thing thinks it's outside so it just chirps away. anyway, what else is going on. i don't really like my calculus class cause everyone in there is really snobby and already attached to their own group of friends. i don't know how that happened and where I was, but whatever. you'd think in a class like calculus there'd be a bunch of nerds, but not at all. i have to go shopping soon. i need one of those wallets with the key chain thingy attached to it. that would make my life so much easier. it's strange how little things can make your day go a lot smoother. like, getting down to the cafeteria right before it closes. or meeting someone after a long time and spending the whole day with them. or getting a call from someone you love. or realizing that you're going to be okay at UT. or getting a good night's rest after a long time. those kinds of things. okay, that was a really weird tangent. anyways, um. got nothing to say. oh, okay. i find it really hard to get on line once I'm at college. i dunno. i just feel like it's a chore to talk to people or write really long letters and I'm sure my friends are getting a little ticked that I'm doing that. but, I just feel like I'm wasting my time on the comp. i really want some grapes right now. i went to HEB yesterday and I got all this fruit. actually, I think I got too much. but anyways, I got the really big maroon seedless ones. oooh, they are the best. i wish they had better shopping places on the drag. either it's too expensive, or the clothes just suck. I feel like going out today cause I don't have a class till one tommorrow. maybe to a nice restaurant or something. well, actually, I'm finding it really hard to make myself do something. like, for examle, I need to mail out the thank you cards for my graduation party, as it is, they are already 3 weeks late. and I just don't have the will to do it. i mean, I see them everyday sitting on top of my desk, but I jsut don't do it. and I have to look at my bills and balance my checkbook and stuff but I hate doing that kind of stuff. i dunno. i guess I'm just getting too lazy. the other day someone accused me of that, and proved it to him by doing something taht I would have ordinarily not done and when I told him about it yesterday. he just said that I did it for me not for him. it didn't really make a difference to him wether I did it or not. and I realized that was true. when you do something out of spite, you're not doing it for anyone else but yourself. i miss my mom. i need to send her a card soon. "
Tell me about yourself.,"lately I think of how I have to study and study hard because I would hate to be putting my family's financial status at risk. then I keep an eye out for work thats on campus and make plans to call only I wonder why I'm not getting on the ball with what I know is important. I'm worried about money, very worried about not following throught and disappointing my parents. you know I feel like going back to arlington and visit my family and friends, but I don't want them to think that I'm very homesick cause I don't think that I am . not really. it's relaly only been two weeks away. but it will be labor day weekend so it's okay to be home, I think. wandering if my mom actually plans on meeting my boyfriends mom. kinda nervous because his mom just found out we were going out and so . who knows what she's thinking. I'm trying to figure out how to tell my dad. he reassured me that he's not setting limits on me just that he wants me to take care of school first. why is it my roommate and best friend seems to be in this room as little as possible. I think I'm in here more than I should be but then I like being alone sometimes. wonder if my friends think that I'm just anti-social and don't want to try things. I don't go out of the room except to run, go to class, do an errand. just remembered that I have to go get some handbook for art class and its sold at  I T copy. I just don't feel like going to get it right away. think I'll get it after a class tomorrow since I'm already going to be out. don't want to go to room and then go back out until I have class. why do I wait? my dad told me not to put things off, and I said I know but I still do it. scary thinking that I have a whole 4 maybe 5 years of schooling left until I am really on my own. i feel kind of on my own right now. just without parents. when I think of my parents I remember when they left after helping me move in. the days before I thought I was going to cry when they said goodbye because I have been so family-oriented but as they left I came close to tears but they didn't come. hmm that's weird. I love my mom so much that I can't think of why I didn't break into tears. she's always been there. and my dad. well. i came very close to it when he told me he loved mebecause I think the last time I heard him say that to me was so far back I can't remember. then my boyfriend came to spend time with me before he starts school. i was pretty sure I would be okay and that I wouldnt cry. then he left and I cried. lots. strangely he came back and then when he really had to leave I didnt cry. people have a way of disappointing you and making you feel bad. I thought this guy was my friend even when we were distant and then I had to find out that he told a girl I am no longer friends with that he didnt like me. I was in shock I didnt know what to do. my friends have a thing for changing their minds quickly and then saying that they are not different. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Today is another boring day. I do not know why I chose UT for. It is so differnt from what I thought it would be. Its mainly hard work, but you have a lot of free time to do whatever you want to. I get so bored just staying in my dorm room not doing anything. It is sooooooooo BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I rather go back to Wichita Falls, and attend MSU. Atleast its an smaller school, and I know a lot of people there. Wil I be able to go back this Labor Day weekend, to see everybody, and attend my aunt's weddinng?  I really really really really want to go back. It is sooooooooooo lonelky up here. I just sit in my dorm room and study myself to death. I barely hae any friends here. Most of my friend are back in WF. Wichita Falls, Boy I wish I could be there right now. It has the most fun and memorable events that happen in my life. Those innoncent years, where you don't have to worry about anything. Your parents were always there for you. Now it seem like I'm on my own. This really sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1  I just want to be back home in my own bed, back at high schools being able to talk to the people I know in class. Being able to call teacher Mr. & Mrs. instead of Dr. now. What difference does it make????????  Its just a titile. The sun is shining bright today. Hopefully, my mood will be like that. I have been so down and homesick lately. I just wish I can just go home and be Mommy and Daddy little girl again. My aunt's wedding is this Saturday. I wonder if she'll make a pretty bride or not. School is driving me nuts here. So far, it has been pretty easy, but I don't know what will happen when all the mdterms come. I think I may bombed everything. I miss all my friends!!!!!!!!  I'm still am deciding wheter I should join a sorority or not. It is an easy way to make friends, but I heard that it was mianly parties, and I know that my parents will kill me if I become a party animal. The weather in Austin is sooooo hot and humid. Wichita Falls was hot, but not humid. The humid weather made it worse. I am thinking about my classes that will bother me tomorrow. Its sooooooooo  much work in chemistry and emerging scholars. I think it may not bother me that much but who knows what the future holds. Austin is such a lonely place with oiut a car. I heard 6th street is pretty fun. Maybe I should pay  a visit over there. BUt I heard that there are a lot of crazy people over there too. Man, life sucks doesn't it?  the fun things are always follow by danger. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Life is so strange. For instance today I saw someone who lives right next to me that I haven't seen since I was in my hometown. I don't get guys at all. Why is it that guys can act so uninterested and be so rude? It's strange because if a girl likes a guy she thinks about him and talks to her friends about him and can't wait to hear from him, but guys act like they could care less and don't even call you for acouple of days and don't think anything of it. Why is that? When I have been talking to a guy and he doesn't call me it makes me feel unwanted and I tend to get pissed off. I miss my best friend in the whole world. He is at Rice and my friend and I went and saw him last weekend but ever since I saw him I have been missing him more because I guess I remembered how much he ment to me. The whole thing with this guy I'vebeen talking to is that he doesn't act interesting and because of it he makes me question myself and has caused me to be homesick and yern for letters and calls from my parents and all of my friends from back home. It's strange how certain things trigger you to feel a certain way. I've been eating a lot of sweet stuff today and I've decided that once you've tasted something sweet you keep craving more until you're out of it or you leave the room. My roommate is nice, but she and I have a wierd relationship. We get along fine, but she isn't what I would call a good friend. That is one of the reasons I am never in my dorm room. Why is it that people can be so mean to eachother? I don't like to be mean to other people especially if I don't know them but there are peole out there who will be maen and not even care about it. I also don't get why friends think they should lie to eachother. As a friend you're supposed to be there for someone no matter what, but if your friendis lying to you it makes it so much harder to forgive them once you find out. Some of my closest friends did this to me and now because ofit I don't even associate with them. I don't understand why people feel theneed to drink all the time also. Who says that in order to have a good time we must drink. I met this guy yesterday at dinner who asked my friend and I if we drank and continued to tell us how stupid it was because as children we have fun and do things just because, but as adults we must get dunkk in order to have a good time. I have never felt that I could justify drinking and I still don't. I have drank a few times but just as an experiment, not every weekend. It is crazy to me the number ofpeople who drink on a regualr basis. My friend at Rice has been known to drink and that bothers me considerably because I don't want to seem him get addicted or get hurt. His father has a drinking problem and I worry that will have an effect on him. My friend Cassie is so sweet we have just recently become good friends and we have so much fun together. She is one of those people who could care less what others thought so she just says ""hi"" to people on the street. THat's one of the reasons I enjoy her so much is because she makes me feel like it's ok to just be nice and friendly to everyone and not worry whether or not htey think I'm crazy for doing it or not. My mother get's on my case about everything and nags me all the time. I know she's just trying to look after me and keep me safe, and it doesn't help that I'm an only child but, sometimes I can't handle all of her questions and concerns. I wish she'd just relax and let me live. Don't get me wrong she's the greatest and I wouldn't change her for anything I just think it's time to start seperating what she thinks I should do and what I want to do. Life is funny we go through it trying to make something of ourselve and live up to everyones standards when really we should just live up to our own and try and be happy and make some great friends along the way and hopefully help a fewpeople along the way. Like yesterday I was walking and this guy in a wheelchair was trying to wheel himself up a hill and he was strugglinng. somone asked him for help and he accepted. More people in the world should just do little acts like that that help one person out so they don't have to struggle so much. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Just got back from the store, its 10:30pm Sunday and I have a ton of home work. My EE321 lab is due this week, but the lab was closed today. makes me mad. No notice or anything, just *poof* and its closed. I studied witha  friend for my other EE class. The stuff is easy but time consuming. I'm worried about my grade in there. Not so much in that I think I'm stupid, but that the Prof's tests are killer. I know this from *many* EE grads who have had him in the past. He's also known for being very hard on students in his office hours. something I'm not pleased with. I'd like to talk to him about the class without worring about him ripping me a new asshole just because I don't have the practical experiance in circuit theory he has. After all, I'm just a junior. School eats up most of my thinking. THere is always a deadline or a test or a lab (or a writting assignment) that is due. it always keeps me jumpy. Allison (my wife) is doing her laundry. on our porch. The washing machine is in our storage closet out there. I'm so glad we're moving. This place sucks. I don't like the way the managment was replaced. and how the new people will lie to the tennants. One building has termites, another gets broken into a lot. The managment will not address these issues, and will act surprised each time you tell them about it. like they didn't already know. All I know is that I have to stay late tomorrow on campus because I have to finish my lab, I might be on campus till 10pm tomorow for all I know. Lab does close at 10:45pm. so I couldn't stay any later than that. I hate lab. Its like they make it as hard as possible to get anything meaningfull done. Most of the equipment doesn't work, and what does work is being used by someone else. the work itself is never that hard, its just getting past all the setbacks (like bad chips, cables, caps, proto-boards, etc. ). And the hours for the weekend SUCK. ony open about 5 hours sat, and NONE Sunday. I hate it. "
Tell me about yourself.,I am wondering why I am doing this writing assignment and if I really have to because I am doing the research also. THe music that I am listening to right now is very loud. I wonder if I should go to class today. I am very lucky to have checked the web page today because there is a lot of information that I didn't know about. The test coming up on the 15th worries me because I am not sure what it will be over or what to study. My forearm is already beginning to cramp up while I am typing. my leg itches. I like this song that is coming on now. My eyes are very tired. my head itches and I have to scratch it. I think I need to stretch my neck. I really need to start getting more sleep since I have been at college my sleep habits have been horrible. There is something under my foot that is bothering me. I wonder how long I have been typing for. Only five minutes. Now I am feeling like this is going to take forever. It is kind of dark in the room that I am in. I'm thinking about pizza. now I am thinking about the girl who's room I am in. She is in the shower. I ate pizza with her for lunch. She is very beautiful. She sure has been in the shower for a long time. Dave Matthew's songs all sound alike to me. I can't get over how everyone loves that guy like he is the beatles of the 90's or something. My mind has gone blank for a second. What time is it now. Only 8 minutes. How come all girls are getting belly buttons rings. If I was a girl I wouldn't get one. That would hurt and why go through that pain. I think the music is getting louder. Cell phones!  Everybody is getting those too. And they keep getting smaller. That reminds me of Lethal Weapon 4 when Chris Rock complains that they are only making them smaller so they are easier to lose so that you have to buy more phones and they make more money. I can't think of anything. I am wondering if I really have to do this. Time check. 12 minutes. It is hot. It smells like austin water. The water in austin is really hard and always dries out my skin. I need a chair in my room so when I watch tv I don't have to sit on my bed because that hurts my back. My back is hurting right now. Basketball caused my back problems. I should be playing basketball right now. Everybody thinks I am obsessed with basketball because I talk about it a lot but when you love something shouldn't it be on your mind a lot. I want to be a basketball coach. I can't imagine going to a job everyday and be thinking about basketball behind some desk where I can't play or coach. I have to be a coach or I won't enjoy my job. This girl kim drops everything on her feet. I swear to god she has burned herself with her curling iron six times six times since I have been here. sHe just interupted my train of thought. I kind of like this stream of thought thing because I am realizing all the crazy stuff I think about in a given time. THis song satellite. i mean what the hell is he talking about. It doesn't make since. time check. one more minute till I get to hit the infamous submit button. This was kind of fun. my arm is kind of tired though. 
Tell me about yourself.,"Hi, when I think of this type of writing I think of a project that my little sister did once. she is very interested in psycology and writing. for a class she had to do this and I thought it was very strange. right now I am watching the cowboys game. they suck. i love football, but the cowboys have lost all respect as a team because of the actions of their players. Troy Aikman is kind of cute and Emmit Smith is a really nice guy but all the others don't really impress, it is half time right now. My boyfriend plays football for St. marks. I love him because he is my best friend and he is so sweet to me. My friends keep giving me crap because we talk to each other all the time, but I can't imagine not talking to him. Last night at the Pike BBQ thing, Jerry Jeff Walker played and that was cool, except that I had cramps and felt bad and Wes had not called so I was mifted. I knew that he was having fun wiht the boys, but I still wanted to hear from him, I am not sure that I am doing this assignment correctly because it is hard to just write what comes to mind, you know. I fell like I am typing this to someone who is going to read it and so I don't know what to put. I am so tired right now. I went to church this morining with a friend of mine who made me go. (I told her to make me go)  The pastor talked about dying and how our spiritual goal in life is to die. I had issues with that; I don't think I was as openminded as I could have been because I was tired and hungry and grumpy and I had not talked to WEs this morning. My roommates phone is ringing,  I like my roommate a lot , but when he phones ring all night it can be annoying,  We are having fun together though she likes to party a little more than I do. That's okay. I am not that big of a party girl and I think that my friends think I am a party pooper. Oh well, I did not party hard in high school so why start now. I know how to have fun, but I came here to get an education, so studying an dmaking my grades is the most important. my best friend kathleen went to Harvard and she has not called me or talked to me yet. I like her but sometimes she can be very difficult to talk to I think that she was very jealous of my relationship wiht Wes. I am tired adn bored oh well  There are some very ood commercials on the television. I know we weren't supposed to correct our typing, but I am a perfectionist. That is a major character flaw I am not that bad any more, however I am editing this little paper as I go,  I mean that I am just correcting my spelling, I wish that I knew how to type really fast,  liek super fast. wes thinks that I am Super Fine like the sugar I bought to put in my tea. Wow dallas is getting their butts kicked I normally would cuss a little in describing the cowboys, but I don;t knonw if that is appropriate for this assignment, I guess it does not matter one damn bit because it is not like anyone will read this. Anyway, Our pledge retreat was fun, okay this tyoing thing sucks. I have no idea what I am thinking. that is what I am thinking I get to go home and see wes's football game against Kinkaid. I hope that they win. okay why the hell has he not called me yet. this is very frustrating I know that he is busy but I would like to hear from him YEA only one more minute. kick ass. I love that phrase It is fun to say. My roommates phone keeps beebing and it is driving me crazy, well not really  but that was just something to type. okay time is up bu-bye  I like that way of saying bye,  The red skins just scored,  okay really bu-bye this time. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I don't know how to put my thoughts into words. my mind wonders all the time. I'm really tired. the dog is taking a nap -- I wish I was taking a nap, too. I stayed up too late last night. church was hot and not very interesting. I wonder what time we're leaving today. the houston comets are playing very good. I guess they are still mourning the loss of Kim Perrot. her death was so sad. where did that crazy dog go now. I bet she went to take a nap in my bed. my typing probably distrubed her. crap! the comets can't score to save their life. good shot. who the heck is that girl. Sheryl Swoopes is incredibly fast. I wonder why she doesn't get a long with cynthia cooper. pass the ball. rebound. is that a play or what. my sister is being such a baby today. she is so bossy, and when she doesn't get her way, she throws a fit. I never stick up for my brother, but the one time I do, it infuriates her. I can't wait to get back to austin, and I'll stay on my side of town, and she can stay on her side. I won't call her for a couple of days, so she can get completely over her temper tantrum. I hope eryn doesn't call me for a few days. I just want to stay at my dorm and relax and study by myself. this is the stupidest commercial. I hate that Buddy Lee character. I have to go to the bathroom, but I still have 10 minutes to type. I have got to go on a diet. I'm getting extremely fat. I wonder when that aerobics program gets started. I hope it won't be too hard. I have got to set the vcr to tape my soaps for the week. I hate missing those shows. that girl is such a weiner. she is always getting hurt. I'm getting sick of typing. oh that was a cheap foul. I wonder how they wash there hair when it's in those braids. I bet it stinks. that girl is ugly. he is a horrible dresser. I wonder how much money they make. my watch is rubbing my hand. my eyes are tired. I haven't seen this commercial before. it's kind of dumb. my mind is starting to take a nap. it isn't wondering so much anymore. I hate that when I get in a daze and just stare at people. it's embarrassing. this game is getting boring, I wonder if there are any other games on. when do the cowboys play today. how much more room do I have. I guess I get as much room as I want. cynthia cooper is cocky. why do they wear lipstick when they play. that is retarded. they dress up to get sweaty and work out. I wonder how loud it is in that arena. my head itches. I think someone is driving up to my house. that's a walk! the comets are looking better. is it supposed to rain today. it's pretty cloudy out there. my throat hurts. I wonder if I'm getting sick. man I'm tired. can I ever run out of water in my eyes. every time I yawn my eyes fill completely, and --- the phone is ringing --- I looked at the caller id, but I don't want to talk to that person. I still have to go to the bathroom. well it's been 23 minutes, so I'm going to quit. I hope I did this right.      "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now my mind is confused because I'm not sure what exactly I am suppose to be writing. I think the more I write, the more information flows into my mind. For example, write now I just thought about how sunburned I am, and I wonder if I am going to peal. I'm also thinking about what I'm going to do tonight. I'm so tired, but I don't want to miss a night out with my friends. Seeing how I'm at my home in Tyler, I feel that I should spend as much time as I can with the people I don't see everyday. It is my first time to come home from college and I'm begining to understand what say about it being so stressful. There is just so much to do and not nearly enough time to do it in. I constantly think of all the homework and reading I should be doing in all my spare moments, but it's just so hard to concentrate when there is so much to do. I just found out that tTexas won today. I'm mad I missed the game-I bet it was so exciting. I hope this whole thing doesn't sound too dumb, although I'm sure it does. I wonder what everyone else has written on this assignment. I'm not a very deep person, but I have a feeling that this class will help me learn some things about myself and what I DO think about. There is so much going on in my head that it's hard to pick out every single thought. Well, I just looked down and my time is up. hope this has been interesting to read!!  "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm looking at a picture of my best friend who is now in Nashville adn I wonder what she is doing right now. I'm wondering what my boyfriend is doing at school at this very moment and why is every second centered around me like a movie or something, I think we should be able to take a sneek peek into others lives right when we want to. I've wanted to know why life isn't that easy. Pictures are supposed to make you happy and remember happy times yet when I see them I just think about times that will never take place again because they are in the past. Sometimes I seriously resent the past. I need to do my laundry and I need to put a different CD on the player because this one is getting old. I got two card for Greg and I need to get off my butt and get the stamps. My mind is just full of things I need to do but I figured I would get this one done first, before I forget to do it later. I'm still hungry and I'm not sure if it is out of boredom or what. I refuse to get the freshmen fifteen because I'm happy with my weight right now. I like to workout and I need to do it more now that I have the chance right now. I hope my mom is doing well at her job right now. I also hope I get to go home for labor day to see Greg for the first time in two weeks. I miss him so much, but if I stay busy it won't be that hard and will go real quick. Twenty minutes sure is a long time and I don't know how long I have been on the computer, it seems like the internet and email are the only links to people outside of UT. I would call more but bills are so expensive. I need to make my bed before I turn into a complete slob. The chair at this desk is way uncomfortable right now and my legs hurt from walking. My feet are going to look so ugly after one semester here but oh well. I'm going to get stamps after finishing this, I can't wait until it gets cold. Hot weather makes me so tired all the time. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Life is ever changing. Nothing remains the same yet, you keep everything with you. Every good thing that has made you happy and every bad thing that has changed you in one-way or another. Right now I miss him. I feel love and sorrow. Lose for what we never found. Why wasn't I the one. OR instead, Am I the one who he needs?  I hate questions that keep me up at night. You tell yourself, ""Go to Sleep. You have a big day ahead of you""  But does your mind pay any attention to what your body needs?  No, never. So, I find myself wondering what he is doing and what he is thinking. Is he okay?  Not caring if he is with someone else, just wishing him happiness. I hate myself for being so nice. People use me and don't even bother to thank me for that. Is that to much to ask, A simple ""Thank You""?  I am greatfull for lots of things. For my mother and father and grandmother. By the way I wish she were hear. Sadness with a touch of happiness runs through my body as I think of her. As I think of when I was two years old and would help her clean the house. About all the days she made sure I went to school and did my homework. Especially of the day she left us. The day she left me. I was running. I remember I wanted her and she couldn't say anything. All I wanted was to say ""Thank You"" for all the love she showed me. I guess that is why I say Thank You for everything now. I should have told her that she ment everything to me. Well, I did, but I don't know if she heard me. It is because of her I am who I am today. Not only that, it is because of her that I am here. The world should be a better place. Not for anyone in particular. No, just everyone. People should be happy with who they are inside. If not, than it is difficult to reveal yourself to anyone. How many people do you know that became who they are or accomplished what they have by being true to themeselves?  I don't know many. Sure, I'm only 18, (well 19 next week) but life has not been easy to me either. When I think of my childhood I don't have fond memories. Most people I know would easily go back to the days they had no worries as children. Well, not I. I hated being a child. Even then everyone took control of me. Starting at the age of six my brother sexually abused me. Can you imagine that?  My own brother. Sure, I forgave him, but he wasn't the last. I don't remember how many people messed with me as a child, I try my best not to think of that time-period. Though I do remember that I wanted to be better a better person when I grew up. I wanted to leave and never return to the pain. Now I am strong. Stronger than what most percieve me to be. I love everyone despit the fact people are harmful. I trust everyone despite the fact people are decietful. Most importantly, I am happy. Though I do miss holding him:) "
Tell me about yourself.,"Computers, I hate them. Today has been a very fustrating day. Hours spent on waiting on people. Hours that I have wasted. I am nerous about not what is coming soon. I have so much work to do. I still don't have my Organic Book for organic. Gosh, I am so behind and the first exam is coming up really soon and I still haven't study for it. Worries, how come people have to have all different kind of worries. Isn't that dumb. I need to start studying soon. I guess I just work sleep tonight. Stay up for a while studying. I also got to understand Mirco. I am also behind in mirco. School. ahhh. Oh well, school is ok, but I really miss my friends in Purdue. They call and write but I really miss them. Everytime I talk to them I feel like flying back to Purdue. hehe Larmie just said something funny. I am hungry. I didn't eat dinner coz I was on the phone waiting for the people on the computer to help me. I have this . I forgot. Anyway. I really miss everything in Purdue. My friends and that fall is coming. My friend just wrote me and told me about how fall is coming. That makes me very jealous coz fall is my favorite season and I won't be able to enjoy it. I am stuck here in Texas, hot hot hot. Gosh, I really miss Purdue. Evi, Jerry, everyone one else. I am getting annoy. I am using a friends comp coz my doesn't work now. anyway her boyfriend is online and wants to talk to her but I am using it doing this assignment but he keep on making these noise. My friend is on the phone talking to a friend from back home. I . can't wait until thanksgiving or xmas. Coz then my friends from PUrdue is coming to visit me and I am planni to visit them on xmas. One thing I like aobut UT, I guess, is that we have 5 weeks off. That is good. But if I go to work, I probably won't be able to go to IN. I want to eat, I guess, I will after I finish with  this assignment. her boyfriend is making knocking noises now. I really want to tell him that I am doing an assignment now but then he will keep on asking and then I will waste my time, but he is really getting on my nerves. I don't want to be rude to him, since I am using my friends comp and he is her boyfriend. I still thinking about Purdue. How I miss that stupid place. I use to complain how I don't like it that much. But now, I trhink in many ways it is better than UT. I guess it is because I am not use to this place and that I haven't met that many friends yet. I don't think I will met that many friends now. Coz the people in my classes are either junior or senior. Some sophomore but not much. They all have there own group already and I guess they are not really interested in meeting anymore people. I just reply to her boyfriend and I don't know what I was going to say. Oh, well, Oh, people here I guess they are not in the stage where they want to make that many new friends. I understand coz if I were them I guess I won't either. If I was in Purdue, I probably won't make any new friends coz I already have my own. They know me and right now,here I still don't care much coz I still have friends back home. Not really home coz home is now in Texas. I wish I was back there sometimes but I also glad I am here, maybe I get to learn to be more independent. If I was in PUrdue right now, I probably don't have to worry about the comp coz I will have plenty of friends helping me setup. I don't even have to do it myself. I think I might learn something from this. I hope I do, coz if not, I will be upset coz going though all this and still don't know hope to fix the mistake I will feel useless. I don't want to feel useless. wow I think I am really hungry coz my stomach is making a lot of noise. Maybe in a few more minutes I can go to eat. i have to eat noodles, I guess it isn't that bad. After that I think I will go do assignment 2 and then I will go study , can't study orgo, coz I don't have the book, maybe microbiology. I need to understand that. I hope I can find someone who can help me with  my problems. Just some friends like I have in Purdue, who cna help me when I need help. Some people who understand computers, some who can help me with  classes and some who can help bring me places. Hmmm I wonder if I will make those kind of friends. If so, I hope soon. Until then, I guess I will miss PUrdue a lot. well, got to go eat coz I am really hungry. I think , I hope this is long enough. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now my thoughts are geared toward wether or not I just submitted a blank page because I hit the tab button so I could write in paragraph form and then boom. the screen said you have submitted, thankyou. But anyways I hadn't even started. Right now I have no idea what I am supposed to be writing, the assignment seems to easy. Usually that means I'm doing something wrong. Right now my thoughts are concentrating on thinking of things to write. I feel like I'm in a sort of mellow mood, after all, there's not much excitng going on right know. I have calculus to do and I almost don't want to pick up the book because I know I won't be able to do some, andthen I may get a bad grade on the homework. That means that I will get a bad grade in the class unless I do perfect on the tests. Well, I wish I knew how to type, not that this assignment would go by any faster. Sensations? Well I'm sitting on a chair, I can feel it supporting me. I have this habit of biting my lips, so I can feel that to. Only bite the inside of your lips because then they don't look all messed up all the time. If someone reads this they are going to think strange things of me. I wonder if the box keeps going, yes it does. Wait. agh. a drink of water. More sensations!!  I felt the water coldly flow down my neck where I imagine it's being mixed with luch. which was a 9 inch sub from ""PO Boys?""  At least it was relatively healthy, but it's more expensive than Wendy's. Oh man I hope that somebody doesn't call because I might have to write this over again. Or does the computer automatically kick you off the internt when you have been on for more than 10 minutes and not done anything, that would be bad. Does that mean that I would have to go back and write this all over again. Well, I can't wait to get this done because I get to relax for one damn second of the day. I've been up since 7 walking around carrying ahuge bag on my back. It makes me hunch over because if I stand up straight then I would fall over. I hope I don't have a bad back when I'm older. at least I'll be smart. Wow I've already been writing for 15 minutes, probably about the wrong stuff, but hey. Another sensation is my fingers hitting the keyboard. And I can see the keyboard. My cell phone just rang, I could hear that. Well, anyways, this whole 20 minute thing is leaving me with nothing else to think about. I wonder what other people wrote, actually I could care less. Their interpretation of the directions is no better than mine, but anyways. I really hope this actually submits. after all, it is the last minute. I'm glad Paul reminded me. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now I am tired, sleepy, and restless. Stressed about finishing work and school. I have a lot of work to get done before going to school. I want to get off to a good start this year and not fall behind. I need to finish this assingnment and get to others before school starts. I'm hungry and I need to make some food along with other things I need to do. I think I'll make a sandwich. I also need to take a shower before I go. I need to get my clothes out of the dryer so I have something to wear. I think I'll wear shorts today. I'll also wear a baseball cap. I want to pickup a cd on my way back from school today. Also need some groceries. I hope I don't have much homework tonight. Only a few more days until the weekend. I'm going to Houston this weekend, that will be fun. This is a three-day weekend. I'm looking forward to having three days off. I'll probably hang out with friends and go to a movie this weekend. Oh, yeah, Jared is back in town this week. I'll probably hang out with him this Friday, cause Saturday morning I have to go out of town. What is today?  Tuesday. That means I only have two classes today. That's pretty good, but the next two days are pretty long days, and then Friday is another short day. My 20 minutes is  almost up. I'm glad I got this writing assignment done and out of the way. Well, I guess that's it.  "
Tell me about yourself.,"I have a lot of stuff to do tonight. I'm glad I'm getting this done relatively early. I wont have to worry about it when it comes time to turn it in. I usually don't get assignments done thiis quick but I have a lot of stuff to talk about soi thought I'd go ahead and do it. I found out about bonnie having breast cancer today and that just adds to the fact that meme has cancer as well. that's two people in one week that I'm close to that have found out that they have cancer. I haven't known many people in my life wit hcancer and all of the sudden this happens. I really wish they didn't have to go through kemo therapy. it seems so primitive and I hope a more efficient and effective cure is found soon. I talked to rachel tonight. I know we will probably never have anything but the situation with her mom may bring us all very close. I love them like my own family and I know that me and mom are ready to fly out there anytime we're needed. five minutes have gone by and I'm already tired of typing. I'm excited about seeing ashley this weekend. I miss her. I'm really looking forward to meeting all of seth's friends. he says they're all hot so this ought  to be a good weekend. I'm glad everything has worked out with seth and my parents. I feel a lot more happy when I talk to rachel. she still has that effect on me even after the rough time we had this summer. I still think she is one of the finest girls I have ever met. I just got a new email but I can't check it for another ten minutes and that is going to drive me crazy. I have to clean my truck out tomorrow. after starr dumped that frapuccino all over the place, it has stunk in there. this is a really good song. I like listening to heartbeats on the beat. somethimes they depress me though. I wish I could send one out to someone special. I'm sure she's out there; I just have to be patient and not try to force anything to happen. I have a really good life. it would be much better with a girl but I can do without untill the right one comes along. I'm so excited about going to vail for new year's. we're going to have so much fun. I'm glad kim is going. she is so cool and my best friend in the world. kelly is such a good cook. so is mom. those were both very random. I'm not sure where I want move next year. I pretty much have any option open since brannon lives in some of the most expensive appartments in the city. I only have five minutes left. this is a cool assignment. I like to just sit down and write my feelings for a while sometimes. it helps t osoothe my nerves. I really wish I could check my mail. I have a lot of readiign to do. I love this stuff we're talking about in psycology. I'm not just trying to suck up or anything because I figure dr. penn wont even read this. it is all just really intriguing to me and I am haveing so much fun. I hope meme and bonnie are both alright. I want to see the ellenburgs again. I hope they come out and see us soon. I want to see rachel again, too. and reagan. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, my first thought is that I don't quite understand this activity. I'm not sure if you want me to tell you my thoughts, as in a journal, or just irrevelant thoughts that pop into my head as I type, therefore I'll just write a journal entry. Well, right now I'm mad at my friend because she seems to be choosing her boyfriend over me to hang out with, so I guess that would make me jealous. And it doesn't help the fact that she and her boyfriend are the only two people at UT that I know. Another feeling that I'm experiencing is sadness and homesickness. I just talked to my best friend, who is attending the University of North Texas, and she was describing to me how much fun she is having and how many friends she is making-this makes me sad because I know that she is having more fun than I am. I think jealousy has a little to do with that also. I talk to my parents almost every day, and they describe their everyday life to me, and I feel left out almost, because I can't be there with them. I miss the normalcy of home. I miss waking up in the morning and knowing who my friends are, and what to expect in my classes. I know that things will change, I'm just really anxious for that to happen. Sometimes I doubt if I made the right decision by coming to UT. Would things be different if I were at UNT with my best friend?  I know things would be better. I was always afraid that if I went to UNT, my best friend would think that I was going there only because I couldn't make friends anywhere else. I only decided to come here to UT because they have an outstanding business department, and I plan to major in Management Information Systems(MIS). I'm a little overwhelmed right now because it seems like there is so much to do. In every single class so much is expected of you. It will just take a little time to get used to everything. I don't adapt well to change-I'm very much a habitual person. "
Tell me about yourself.,"hopefully I remember to stop in 20 minutes. my mind went blank for a sec. what should I write about, what am I thinking about. what is this group's name, the group who sings ""what's my age again. "" it's blink 182. just thinking about the song, singing it in my head. should I go ahead and write the lyrics down since it's in my head? keep on singing the song. now I'm pondering about what I should write and think. I hate this song, christina aguilera's ""genie in a bottle. "" my is thinking what to think so that I can type it down. my mind is completely blank, I have no thought or feeling whatsoever. now the room is getting cold. I can feel goosebumps forming. I'm singing the song I don't like. I was thinking that thank goodness I'm not working tomorrow morning. my eyes are beginning to hurt from staying glued onto the computer. I wonder is it time yet? another song is playing, and again I'm singing to it. singing the song. come on, think of something so that I can type it down. thinking of what I need to do tomorrow: go to co-op and return my books before it's too late to get a full refund on books. I have to meet with my sister so that I can get her some food. I also need to go this store so that I can buy a new pair of sandals since the ones I have right now are getting ready to tear on me. it's located behind einsten's bagel store. my mind is drifting back to the song. I think the music is distracting me from thinking. all I can think are the lyrics of the song and nothing else unless I make myself think of something. now another song is playing, but I forget who sang it. the name of the song is ""how's it going to be. "" trying to think of the artist who sings this song. I can't seem to think of the artist's name, but I know it, it's like it's on the tip of my tongue. I know it, but can't say it. I hate that feeling. my mind is once again blank. I'm thinking about the mall. because today we went to the mall. I'm now thinking about the topic of this writing assignment, am I doing it correctly? hopefully. how long do I have to go now? just thinking about the meeting that our dorm is to have concerning with sex since the radio had said something dealing with sex. I'm now making myself think of things. so I'm thinking of when I'm going to go back home. I'm thinking about wanting to go shopping. I'm thinking about the allegations I've read in the daily texan on gap. about how the were alleged to using sportshops. I'm thinking that if the allegations are true, will I continue to shop there. I'm thinking about the m&m commercial, the latest one, since I thought I heard something similiar to that on the radio. I was thinking of something, but was unable to type it down, wasn't fast enough. thinking of the song that is now pllaying, tlc's ""unpretty. "" is time yet? feels like 20 minutes is forever and endless. when is this over. found out that I have one minute leftover. feel like just stopping since it's only one minute. reminiscing about my chat with my friend through the aol instant messaging. I think it's time. time now. yes, I'm done. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I feel stressed as there is not enough time for anything. Will this ever slow down. Always things, always processes. I am glad school has started again, yet  I am worried how everything will turn out. I am angry with my step mother. A death in the family has made me depressed, and happy at the same time because I know that she is no longer hurting and is in a happier place. I am frustrated with growing out my hair. My dads and my relationship has grown since our talk last week. I am dissapointed in the way I acted a couple of days ago. I hope my dads and my relationship continues to grow and build. I am ready for the heat to go away it is miserable out side. I feel dissapointed in myselfif I don't work out daily, and I probably shouldnt. I love my new apartment, but sometimes I feel lonely. I think I will like all of my classes this year because they all seem very interesting. I need to enjoy something to do well in it. "
Tell me about yourself.,"As for now, I feel as if quite a weight of stress has been lifted off of my shoulders. I had many things to accomplish once I started school here at The university of Texas and I am finally beginning to lighten the stress little by little as I achive the goals I need to. for instance, today, I needed to petition credit of hours which I earned off of the ap testing which I took in highschool. I attempted to do it off of my compuiter but for some reason, even though I typed the correct web site, I could not actually claim my hours. Thus I actually went to the Measures and Evaluations building which allowed me to finally claim and petition my scores. also, the week before school started, I was ecxperiencing stress due to the fact that the ethernet card I purchased for my computer had a cd which was burned and incompetent of following the demanded preocedures. at that time, one evening I finally cried because of the accumulated stress which had built up immensly. thankfully, right now I am a  much happier person both on the enterier and teh exterior. for example, I began to write to all of my friends back home as well as write to my penpal who lives in Cicago Ilinois. I am starting to miss all of my friends and my family. the voices of my loved family do not leave my head. instead, their words repeatedly play in my mind as they are right now. I remember things my brother said to me whether it was great advice, or even a comment which brought me down. many times I feel that I can trust my brothers opinion since he tells me anything I need to know extremely bluntly and straight out. all my female friends I know may try to beat around the bush by telling me a point. I do the same thing. I care for my friends and try to tell them everything in a very nice way. however, when it comes to my biological brother,  he is probably the most honest boy who has ever spolken to me. who has ever spoken to me. I miss him a lot. actually I probably would not have been so homesick had my roommate not convinced me how much more comfortable and relaxed I would be at home. last weekend, she went home to visit her family and friends. when she came back, she told me that she was looking forward for the next weekend so she could go home and sleep in her own room once again. wow, how could I not imagine how nice it would be for me to go home as well and see all my old friends again. I really miss them. in addition, I miss my friends which go to different schools. I keep pictures of them to reminfd me of the friendship they shared with me. it is almost as if they are close in a way, but, not really. my mom on the other hand may just miss me quite a bit. I am looking forward to seeing her since she is in california visiting my precious grandmother right now. I'm very close to my mom and that is why I believe that my leaving may affect her and me. we are like best friends who tell each other anything in our lives. she cares for me and I hope that whatever I choose to do with my life I can impress her. however I would never do anything simply because of the reason that only she wants it of me. in fact she trusts me well enough to know that I will be able to grow up to be an independent person with great values, goals, and striving ambitions. my mother also helps in relieving my endless stress. just knowing that I can count on both my parents aids me in relaxing and doing the best that I can. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I wonder if they sell show posters at that let's see, I have 2:44, I have until about 3:05 to write, no that's not right, yes, wait, yeah it is, anyway, I wish I could go back to new york I remember the New Amsterdam I got to tell Sarah I ran into Margret today and that she lives in Blanton, with the teletubby wrappingpaper on the door, I should tell Jessica too, I wonder how Carrie is and why hasn't she e-mailed me back, I wonder what Julianne's up to  right now.

Tell me about yourself.,"Well, to begin with I am simply thinking that I don't think I can type for 20 minutes without my fingers cramping up. But that is Ok I suppose since I doubt that anyone will ever read this because in a class of 500 students, I don't think anyone is insane enough to sit down for the time it would take to sort through my terribly confused thoughts. Confusion is a funny thing. It comes all at once and for most people it comes quite often. At least I think it comes quite often since it comes to me quite often. Even when you know exactly what to do, sometimes you can get confused because you don't want to do what you are supposed to. Sometimes you just have to bite the bullet. (In a manner of speaking)  I am thinking that I am tired of writing about confusion. It's kind of like thinking about thinking. I heard that it is bad for you to do that. I think it destroys brain cells. But then again, a lot of things destroy brain cells. Drugs destroy brain cells. I don't do drugs because I don't think I have very many brain cells to spare. Wow, only 5 minutes have passed!  That is terrible because the tips of my fingers are getting sore and I don't want to stop because you just might have some kind of secret timing mechanism on this little web site of yours and I am taking no chances with that kind of stuff. I know how sneaky teachers can be. I know how sneaky students can be. Some chick was all cheating on out Math Quiz today. I don't know who she was, but she was just flipping through her notes. The teacher had no clue. He was too busy daydreaming. I could have cheated also, but I don't like to cheat. I think that if my best isn't good enough for the professors at UT, then too bad, I'll go to community college. I would rather have a degree from ACC that I earned than one from UT that I cheated my way to getting. I think most people would agree with me but who knows!  I tend to think that people are good. But that notion has bitten me in the buttocks more than once. Take for instance my good friend Tiffany. Yes, good ol' tiffany. I loved her to death. We were really good friends. We did everything together. Then one day I found out that she was sleeping with my boyfriend, John. That was quite a shock to me. I was so depressed. I didn't even want to get out of bed. I did, but it was one of the hardest things I ever had to do. I was really very in love with him and I thought that he was in love with me too. I guess that is just one example of how stupid I am. So I guess I learned from my experience. People aren't as good as you would want them to be. But then again maybe I didn't learn jack. because the next guy I went out with was a jerk too. Well, he actually was a decent guy. At least that is what I said to everyone when they told me he was a ""player"". Oh gosh I still have 7 more minutes. Well anyways, they told me he was a player but he said that he thought I was the most beautiful person he had ever met, inside and out. That was it, I was hooked. That is all I have ever wanted was for someone to tell me that I was special. He made me feel pretty and he told me I had the most awesome personality he had ever encountered in a person. I loved hearing him say that. I was willing to risk everything. I even compromised my friendship with my roomate. See, she said they were just friends, and so did he, but then when him and I went out for the first time, she was very pist off. I didn't know why, but it became a suspicion of mine that she secretly liked him. I asked her about it, and she denied it. But I still to this day do not know what to think about her liking him. I mean, she did encourage me an unususal amount to break up with him. Not that it would do her any good because he really would never go out with her. But still, I wonder sometimes if she ever did like him. She is a strong willed person and I thought that she would just come clean and admit it if she did. But the thing about strong people is that most of the time they are often weak. they are just good actors and can hide it better than the rest of us. I think all humans can have the same amount of strenghth. I think that if you just pretend to be strong, then everyone will think you are strong. It is from this facade that you can draw strenght. Take for instance Omar. I act like I don't care about him at all when really I still care for him a lot. Now, since everyone thinks I am strong I just pretend that I don't care about him and it helps me to deal with it when we are around each other. I guess I kind of slipped the other day when I got drunk and called him on the telephone at 4:00 in the morning. Hey, I hope nobody reads this because this is some embarassing stuff and I really don't think that anyone should know about my loser life except for me and the Power Macintosh. OK well I am pretty much done now. I guess that wasn't so hard after all. I hope the next assignment is this easy. Not that my hands aren't going to cramp up when I finally press submit. Ok, I'm done. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am presently thinking that I cannot believe that I am actually going to sit here and write fo 20 minutes, that is a really really long time. Well I am also thinking that I am fivxing to go to aerobics from 9:00 to 10:00 and not only is it late but it is also going suck. But I need to get into shape. I am worried that if I don't go and excersise I am going to gain that dreaded freshman 15 which will not at all be cool. I come fram a town of 20,000 and everyone knows everyone and all their business so I am sure that if I go home whith any added pounds everyone will notice, and most likely comment. Well I just looked at the clock and I realized that I have only been typing for four minutes, and this really scares me because I do not want to get cramps in my hands. I hate to type, because I am not very good at it and on top of that I do not use very good grammar or punctuation, even after I checked and rechecked my work. So it does worry me that I will have to turn this assignment in unrevised. I cannot get itout of my head how weird I think this assignment is MY friend is now leaning over my shoulder trying to read the assignment and she is making me very nervous. i can not stand to be nervous. The girl next to me just call the little whistle on her screen which notifies her of new mail, and I was thinking that I love it when I hear that noise. Earlier before I started this assignment I checked my e-mail and I had one new message from my friend Travis who goes to Sam Houston State, I was so excited to hear from him he is one of my really good friends. the lady that is in charge of the computer station just made this girl show her, her id and when she asked for it she was not very nice. Which makes me think of the fact that I very strongly dislike people who are rude when they are providing a serviece to you. I mean it is like they are getting paid to do this so I do not know why a little common courtesy is so hard to come by, I am getting really bored with this assignment because I am having a hard time concentrating on typing while at the same time letting things naturally flow into my thoughts. But I guess that you are used to that, I am like also wondering why I am acting like you are actually going to read this because I know that you are not and it seems stupid to sit here and just jabber about nothing, someone else just got the e-mail alarm and once again I am reminded of my most recent message, which I was very excited about, my friend next to me is the one I go to aerobics with and she is already all dressed in her aerobics outfit ready to go. she just interrupted me again to ask me for the instructions on how to get here, I do not like to be bothered when I am in the middle of doing somthing, but I have found that it is very not to be bothered when you are living in a small space with someone, because no matter how quiet they are trying to be they never seem to be quiet enough, I know glanced at the clock again and I realize that at max I only have to type for 3 more minutes which excites me very much. My fingers are cramping and I am getting very old with this assignment I am hoping that the next assignment will not be timed but I am under the impression that with my luck that is am improbability, I feel sorry for my friend she just started the assignment and she has no idea what she has gotten herself into, I cannot wait until she is done so I can ask her what she thought about. WEll MY TIME IS UP!!! "
Tell me about yourself.,"I like to hear music. For some reason, I recently discovered old rock, specifically the group Pink Floyd. Their songs evoke strange feelings of relaxation within me. Why though? I suppose the smoothness of the words accompanied by the awesome guitar. I am reminded of the lyrics ""so do you think you can tell, Heaven and Hell, Blue skies from pain, can you tell a green field, from a cold steel rail?  A smile from a veil?  Do you think you can tell?. cold comfort for change. how I wish you were here, were just two lost soles swimming in a fish bowl, year after year, running over the same old ground, but have we found the same old fears, wish you were here. "" --Pink Floyd's song ""Wish You Were Here. ""      I find myself relaxed yet down though. I am disturbed somewhat from the words; but, why am I feeling relaxed. I think it is from the awesome music and pitch of the singer's voice. Their exotic, at least to me, beginning seems to subliminally evoke depth of thinking even though the words may seem stupid. But, the part of the song I enjoy the most is the fishbowl analogy. I think it is ingenious and I am reminded of myself and my inability to find the right girl of my dreams. For some reason, the analogy portion evokes a sort of chivalric ambition within me. I desire a bit of love and romance from a special person that I want to meet. the perfect girl. Someone with the same aspirations as me. A person that when I look into her eyes I find myself lost. Yet, physically, the act of looking into her eyes would have no physical affect to me in the real world. silly.      Anyway, I am aware that Pink Floyd took drugs and were possibly high while writing this song. I do not condone to taking drugs. In fact I dispise drugs. They ruin lives and for what. So you can loose your mind for a couple of minutes and kill yourself. The best way to counter drugs is not to try them at all. Abstinence from drugs and getting drunk is the best things in life, at least I think so. I don't need to get myself drunk at a party to have a good time. I just need to go regularly and I will have an awesome time. I am reminded of a party I went to a few weeks back. This is a disco party where you dance with girls. I went to the party and was dancing and having a good time. Unfortunately, the other guys needed to get drunk to dance. So, they all went outside to get drunk and came back in. They were the biggest loosers I have ever seen in my life. I suppose they don't have enough self esteem to go out and dance with the girls. Unfortunately, I feel that I miss out because I tend to do the right thing. That is why I am rarely invited to parties. In my whole highschool experience, I have only been to two parties. Pathetic huh!     Anyway I look forward to college to meet some nice girls that will like me for being myself, the good guy. This paper will self destruct after you read it! just kiddin' "
Tell me about yourself.,"OK, it's 8:10 and I hope I can get through this assignment without my computer crashing. I hate typing. chris is an asshole; this was a very bad day and I know it's probably bad to always be negative, but I don't fucking care because this is my stream and no one else's and I don't think anyone will read this anyway and if you do, you'll never know who I am because there are ten million people in that fucking class and no one knows who I am. by they way, would it be fucking possible to go to one of those classes and not be surrounded by sorority bitches? I mean, they are so annoying with their chatter about boys and hair and beer and parties, and they talk in class which is really annoying and they make my skin crawl. well I stopped for like 10 seconds, is that OK? are you going to come over here and kill me now? didn't think so. damn, I am displaying some fucked-up-ness am I not? I knew this was going to be a 301 intro class but I forgot that meant freshmen crawling around everywhere. I was never that stupid. I was never that annoying. well fuck, it's only 8:16; but anyway I have a ton of homework to do today and a friend is coming over  for dessert later, so I need to get this done. i will add some happy thoughts just so you don't apply your analytical theories and conclude that I am mad and need to be injected with some medicines to make me happier and more docile. happy. happy. happy. nothing comes to mind. except that donny's trial is finally over and that makes me happy. my brother, donny, was accused be a couple of girls of molestation during a clarinet lesson and that was nine months ago and my family had to pay thousands of dollars to defend the lucky guy and now we have no money, but at least those mini-whores backed down, yeah thanks, after 9 damn months they were like (my hand hurts) nevermind, we don't want to testify (because we're lieing!!!!) how do you spelll lieing? liing, lying yeah lying, sorry that I don't know how to spell but who cares becasue no one is going to read this anyway. I am a very fast typist so I think that my writing will be longer than most chris just walked by sophie the kitty is playing with the lizards and chris is trying to look at the screen but I think he shouldn't his is my fiance and my fhands hurt carpal tunnel carpal tunnel I have a huge secret: I have a giant crush on an old english teacher of mine; she is a woman; and I an engaged to marry a man. hahahahah. that's funny. I think that htat is very very funnyll meow. I made a cat toy for sophie; a film canaster full of pennies; she loves it; it is loud and my toes are cold; I had hot dogs for dinner; I can't tyep as fast a s my thought are coming; becasue I am thing like a milltion things at a time like tath I sjust spent 900 dollars on a princeton review and I hope that I t gives me a better GRE score than ANYONE in the ENTIRE WORLD!! hahahahahha I don't care what you say; I am taking a break. ok now I am mutch better. muthc I said mutch; hahah I am better my hands don't' just I meant hurt anymore but my toes are still cold. anyway this english teacher is really cool and I've had her for like two semesters and she said I was ""too naughty"" in class. what is chris blowing on? he was blowing on ""a tabby thing on his  book and he wanted the ink to dry. last night he farted and it smelled really bad. ihahahah the things going through my mind. I hiop chris says he wants to read this and that iwll probayy color my thoughts for the duration; could you do something aobut those fukcing standardized tests? I means really? I got a 1260 on my SAT and I hapve a 3. 97 GPA; os that was not a very good predictor of my progress at 8:30 see  you. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am so glad to be home this weekend but at the same time I really feel like crying right now. I don't know what is wrong with me . I don't want to go back to school I really hate it there. I really just wish that I could make some friends it seems like everyone already has made new friends and they don't want any more. I just can't be the type of person to go uot and meet new people. but I may not even be here next semester so what is the point of making friends if I will be at a different school in a month. atleast I have Adam there with me at school I am only happy when I am with him but I can't be with him all the time I have got to live my own life. he says that if I hate the dorm so much that I should move in with him but I am really scared to , I think because I am afraid he will get tired of me. iam also worried that if I change schools next semester that he will give upo on us and want to be with someone that he has there with him all the time. he says that he doesn't want me to leave and I believe him buthim saying that is really unfair to what I want. I am just not happy there at school and he shouldn't want me to stay there just because it makes him happy. atleast things are better now than they were when I first moved to austin . I know that I cried a lot and it was probably annoying but carrye didnt have to yell at me about it she is my friend and my roommate and she should understnad that the transistion to college is not that easy for everyone. I am scared to talk to her about anything because I am afraid she is going tro jump down my throat again. I wish I was good at talking back to people and that I wouldnt let everyone walk all over me . but I can't help it I don't know what to say to people when they trake advantage of me. I don't want to make them mad at me but what can I say . the few times that I did talk back they embarrass me by making it seem like my fault, and like I am freaking out. why are people so mean. I am so ready to just be married and have a job and live my life and not have to follow everyone's rules no one seems to understnd me but hey thats ok I don't even understand myself. I just want to be happy and I am not happy right now and now that I am home I want to go back to school because I feel to growm up and mature for my friends that are here. I will figure it all out one day  "
Tell me about yourself.,"My first reaction to this assignment was to just write that I felt nothing and perhaps continue writing that for 20 minutes; however, I am interested in where this is going. Right now my boyfriend is poking me as he displays how I can touch-type and he cannot. The other day, we went to go and buy fish. We drove around Austin I don't know how many times just looking for pet stores. We drove to Highlands Mall, Lakeline Mall, Petsmart, and Petco. I finally, after searching and carefully chosing, found fish that were supposed. It really upset me that out of the 4 fish that I bought, none of them adapted well in the fish tank environment I previously had. The sole fish that I possessed in that tank ate all of the food I would drop into the tank continuously. It really began to bother me when I saw him nipping at the other fish's tails. So, I took matters into my own hands and separated him from my new, smaller fish. I understand that these unpleasant changes were my own fault. I knew that I was supposed to introduce the new fish into that environment slower and in a certain, specific procedure. Well, I finally figured out that things wouldn't work out between my old fish and the new fish, so I eliminated the problem by flushing the big fish. I am really suprised that I did this because I am such a humanitarian. For example, whenever my other fish would die, I would get other people to remove them from the tank because I couldn't deal with the dead fish. I always felt as though they were looking at me. There is one instance where I did flush other live fish, but once again, it was for the good of the aquarium. I don't know, I think I have always had such a problem with death. It scares me, but it doesn't. For example, I used to work at a hospital in San Antonio, when I was a junior in high school. This is where I had my first real encounter with death. I never had to experience death in my family, in friends, or aquaintences. However, since then I have had to deal with it several times. I guess I take that back, I have had to deal with death one time before, but it was in eighth grade. I can't remember all the minute details of it, but it really brought me and one of my friends together. Anyhow, this hospital death experience really opened my eyes to the whole death scenario. And I know this sounds corney, but every single time I have had to deal with death since then, I have seen a little yellow butterfly. This spiritual experience has consistently happened to me on about 5 or 6 occasions. Well, my 20 minutes is up. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I just went to the union to eat chick-fil-a. i had a coupon for a free meal but they didn't honor it and I felt like I had waste my effort as well as my frined of walkin to the union and wasted our money paying for such an overpriced meal. now, I'm sleepy- I always get sleepy after I eat- especially greasy food. I don't think I have a weight problem, but I htink I should make more frequent trips to gregory to tone myself up. I don't' put much on personal appearance but it's not something to not take care of. i wish I could go take a nap now but I want to finish this assignment and I don't 'want to lie down right after I eat because I heard that it makes u retain all the fat in ur meal if u go to sleep right after u eat because ur body thinks ur sleepign and stores all the fat. i'm not sure how that works but wutever. i'm on aol right now. waiting for a friend from back home in houston to sign on. so I decided to check out the psychology web site while I waited. he's prolly in class at Rice University right now. he's an engineer major and also my best friend. i have two best friends - kristina and stephen. me and stephen have only been best friends for a short period of time where kristina has been my best friend since the sixth grade. she's also in houston. I hate austin it sucks. i wish I was home - me and stephen are confused as to wut defines our relationship- we have strong feelings for each other. romantic one. but we don't seem to think a long distance relationship is ideal. plus we're not committing peoople. i'm awfully tired of this assignment and only 7 minutes have passed by. my neck hurts. i'm usually a tying sorta person. and I guess this is good practice for me- I use the back space key a lot - I wish I could type as well as my roomate jenny lau. she's an excellent typist. i'm just a scrub typer- I have bad coordination- I cna't dance- can't sing - can't 'type- can't play video games. sigh. i'm a good studier though. i don't' mind takin time to do things throughly-- I'm slow at pretty much everything I do but I do them sorta well. i wish stephen would hurry up and get on. he doestn' have his computer because it's at home but I'm sure there are plenty of resources at Rice university. i wish I went to rice. he told me about wut they did up there and it sounds so fun I wish I could get in and I wish I could afford it!then I would sooooo want to go! I think if I do ok this year I could prolly get in. but I don't know abou the other part - I'm gong to ut on scholarship money and I thinki t's going to run out before the 4 years are over. i wish money wasnt' such a big issue in my life. i'm unemployed right now and I have no cash flow but out. it sucks. i think next semester I'll start a work study thing. i wish my parents were architects adn hemotoligists liek stephen's parent's - they're on their way to becoming millionaires. i wish this was in store for my parents. they make lousy money and htey have 4 kids and 3 of whom are in college. my brother is at the university of houston right now and so is my sister. and my best friend. ltos of ppl from school go there. my home town houston. i like it there better than here. i'm sleepy. 13 minutes have gone by . man. where are u stephen? I slept with his tshirt on my bear last nite. i think about him often. i don't think I want to start a romantic relationship with him because I don't think it's worth the risk. i'm an idealist and a romantic and I doubt my best friend could fulfill my romantic desires as a boyfriend. he's a passive person who lets other people control. however he's always in control in his mind. he's so smart and so quiet. he keeps all his thoughts to himself unless u pry at him. he'll open up to me more than his life long best friend brian. i think it's because I'm a gurl and I'm always nosy. so I don't know. i doubt we're right for each other but u never knwo these things we could end up married. highly unlikely but possible. stephen said that he'll save up his money and take me to hawaii- I know that sounds so stupid and so unlikely but I believe it he does get a job soon. a high paying one- like at a computer place like this summer. he can do it - and if he does save up enough money- he really will take me. we've discussed it and he said he'd really try and I believe him. i guess it sounds like I'm trying to convience myself. maybe I am. but I really want to go and I belive that he could make this happen for the both  of us. he believes in having fun and living life so spring break we're there! I hope! hehehe. ok. 2 more minutes and I cna quit. after this I guess I'll write my lil estebie an email - this would be his second day of class at rice. he loves it there. he' an owl all the way. well ok times basically up bye bye bye bye!!!!  "
Tell me about yourself.,"I feel somewhat confident but also unsure about myself entering college. I am  excited about what might become of this expeience and oppotunity but am also  somewhat unsure about some of the greater unknowns out there on a university  cmapus. I am sitting in a some what comfortable chair and that is quite  relaxing although I shoulnd't be so concerned with feelings although they are  important but they can get you into trouble and can misled you sometimes. This  psychology course should be an interestingone and I am looking forward to  learning about personality especially . I have a somewhat usual but unusual  personality,  I feel proud about that which I probably shouldn't because  anything that I have is a gift endowed by the Creator. Pride is something that  creeps into me and this disappoints me when I see it evident in my life  everything that I have is from God ultimately and so I shouldn't have any reason  to be proud of something That God has given to me while I have done some of the  work in the eternal scopeof thing s I will alos be held accountable for any  gifts that I have received. this assignment is somewhat interesting although it  is not sometying that I have done very often I don't like to do things new  naturally but there is something of a Holy Spirit power that has recently  enabled me to do things that I normally wouldn't have had the strength to do pon  my own strength. I think that the truth of Jesus Christ is the most amazing  thing that I have ever encountered I also feel the same way about it . There is  a lonely feeling that tends to pervade me right now but this is soon wiped away  by the invocation of the All- Holy Name ofJesus. Personality is utterly  intriguing I think because it can teeel us so much about people and understand  why we have tendencies to do the things that wed do. I don't really like pearl  jam  but I do like classicla music and I love this group called third Dayu. College is such an interesting concept that it comes at a time that we are  learning to think about things for ourselves and discerning truth from lie. This is a much greater method on the whole than havingh someone else think for   you lest it be God seeing to it how He is the only One that knows all andcan  never err. Truth seeking must be doen in a very humble frame of mind though fo  rif we expect more than we humans are capable of or wait to long to make a  decision, seeing how life is so sort and essential we could die at any time as f  ar as we know. The clock says that I am completed with 19 minutes of the  proposed 20 and I don't know if that is good or bad because I rather enjoyed  this assignment seeing to the fact that I got to talk about some of the thing s  tha t enter my mind sometimes peroidically and sometimes frequently. it is  interesting to observe radom thoughts and frequency of thought and how many  mistakes I amke on the keyboard wh "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am bored, I don't know what to write. I think that I am going to enjoy college. I miss my friends and family from back home, but I am starting to mak new friends here. I will probably go home to visit this weekend for the labor-day holiday. If I do go, I want to make sure that I will have plety of time to rest up, because last time that I went I didn't really get mush time to sleep, so I was pretty tired on my way back. I have been tired all week long now. I went to bed after midnight last night and then I had to get up this morning at five so that I could go do the PT test for the airforc ROTC. We didn't even do anything except count how many reps the upperclassman did. I wish that we could have worked out too. I really hate it while I am doing it, but afterwards I feel pretty good. Tuesday, when I got done with my PT test, I started throwing up on the field. I was pretty tired from the push-ups and the sit-ups already and didn't quite catch my breath yet when I had to start the two mile run. My time for the run went up a minute. I will try to get that back down. I want to be able to max out the push ups and the sit ups by the end of the semester. I want to get as fast at the run as well, becase if you max the run, it is worth twice as much as maxing the pushups or situps. But I care more about those than the run. I need to make up an excercise schedule for the ROTC. I don't really know when I want to do everything. I will probably just do pushups and situps in the mornings before class. Since I have to wake up at five on Tuesdays and Thursdays, I usually wake up pretty early the other days as well. I will just do those excercises and then do my homework. in the evenings, I will go downstairs to the little gym that is here in my dorms to work out. That should be plenty of excercise. I will probably not be able to do it all of the time though. I wanted to start doing the pushups and situps in the mornings this week, but I barely have enough sleep to wake up and go to class much less to work out. I think that I will like it in the Air Force. It doesn't look like I had thought that it would be. They were saying that they weren't allowed to yell at people in their faces like they always have on TV. It looks a little more respectable that the Army. I hope that I will like it. On Tuesday, two cadets each recieved a 2000 dollar scholorship. I want to find out what they had to do to get them. Someone said that to get it you have to have a 4. 0 GPA. I'll bet that there is more to it than that. But I want to try to get a 4. 0 anyways. If I have to get a loan, it will look better. It will also make me more elligible for scholorships. I am going to need the money. NExt year,   I think that I will get and apartment or an efficiency to live in. I think that I would like that more than living in a dorm. It is too noisy here. My roomates are nice, but they like to stay up late, and I always have to get up early, so it irritates me a little bit. I know that they aren't trying to be loud, but when I am dead tired, and they have a bunch of friends over, I just want to scream. But next year I will have my own place by myself. That will be nice. The only problem will be that I will have to cook for myself. I don't really know how to make anything except for scrambled eggs, macaroni and cheese, and breakfast cereal. That probably won't be very nourishing. I will probably need to get a roomate that likes to cook or something. Maybe Melinda and I could move in together and she could cook the food and do the dishes while I go to school. She could also babysit in the apartment to make some extra money. But I don't think that there will be enough money for us to do that. I would really like to help her out, but I don't have enough money, and in the past, every time that I helped her, it just ended up costing my a lot of money, and then after a week or two, she would be back in the same situation, needing my help again. It was very irritating, also. Still, she is a very good friend that I know will always care for me. She is very nice. I just don't think that she is very good handling money. But not everyone is good at that. She is very good with kids, and I'm not very good with them at all myself. I never know what to say to them. I start off talking about cartoons and stuff like that, but after a few minutes, I run out of stuff to say. My cousin Dillian liked me pretty much though. My mother was telling me about how he was so excited that I always made breakfast for him in the mornings when he was over. But I was pretty bored when I was watching him. I couldn't always understand what it was that he was saying, and for the last day,all that he wanted to do was make ice cream out of play-dough and for me to pretend to eat it. It wasn't too bad the first time, but he did it for about a half hour. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am so completely upset with my mother. We used to be so close and now she has turned evil on me!  She's mad about my cell phone bill, well then why did she buy it for me?  I called her the majority of the time anyway. It's not like I was calling Danny or Christie!  I think I- aggh, she seriously thinks I have nothing better to do up here then listen to her bitch about money. I'm trying to earn a college education so I don't have to worry about money. Not that a degree will magically erase all of life's problems, but it will always let me have something to fall back on. I wish I didn't have so much to do. I have a t least 2 chapters to read for each class, and I overslept this morning, so I missed Geography! Oops, I'm seriously not too interested in how the prehistoric man evolved into what we are today, but it seems rather important that I memorize it all now for the sake of the essay test yet to come. What's that all about anyway, essaytests?  Why not just give mc tests like the rest of the world? How boring would that be to read 300 essays over geography? Feel kinda bad for that man. I think that college should come with a scheduled in nap time. Everyone gets tired, it should just be one extra hour where you take your mat and blanket just like in kindergarden and go to your assigned building and sleep! If you show up you get a C if you doze off and on you get a B and if you knonk out you get an A!  Sounds good doesn't it!  It could count as an elective, and those with the hardest classes and the furthest to walk would get to register first!  I'm so smart I scare myself!! Just kidding, well. I still need to find brown shoes. Brown dress shoes, I have this brown dress to wear to this 75th anniversary party, and I don't have shoes!  I feel kinda like the girl in clueless. ohmygod, no shoes whatever will I do?  Seriously, after I enactmy nap time plan, I am going to create a brown dress shoe company. I will make a fortune, because I will be the only person in the world that makes brown shoes!  One day. I have a monster headache, I think it's my contacts, I should probably change them, has it been two weeks? I don't think so!  I'm a responsible person, I just forget to do things sometimes! I had to got to the postoffice today. That was neat. I had no idea what I was doing and I felt like a dumb teenage girl who had never been in any sort of public ""Official"" place. I'll try to stay away from there. Well it's been 20 min! Goodbye!    "
Tell me about yourself.,"I should have done this assingment sooner. It is a different type of assignment from ones I usually get. It is hard to write out what I am thinking about. I can't seem to put my thoughts into words, or maybe I can but I just don't want to tell anyone about somethings that I think about, especially someone I don't really know. I think that is the reason I put off this assignment for so long. I didn't know if I wanted to just pour out all of my thoughts into this assignment. I don't know if I thought I would be ambarrassed with my thoughts or if I just wanted to keep them secret. Not that any of them would be embarrassing. I think that I mostly  just didn't want to have to write them down. It doesn't seem that writing down your thoughts would be very difficult, but once you actually sit down and try to track your thoughts your mind goes blank, or you try to think of something interesting to think about. I was thinking about going to work tonight and wondering if I would actually get off at nine. I also thought about an internet friend from Kansas who I haven't talked to in a while. But I didn't think those were too interesting to write about so I began to think about other things. It is amazing how you can think about so many different things sometimes and at others times you can't think of anything. Just the other day, I was trying to write a philosophy paper and I thought I would be able to write it very easily. But when I actually sat down and began to put my thoughts into words on the paper it came to be extremely difficult. I knew what I wanted to say but it was hard for me to elaborate my thoughts to fill two pages for the assignment. I became frustrated and disappointed with myself brecause I couldn't expand my thoughts. I believe that I could have written a beautiful paper but at the times I sat down to work on it my brain seemed to go blank and I couldn't think of the right words to use or how to make my sentences make sense. I htink that I have this problem often, but usually I can overcome my ""writer's block"" simply by putting the assignment away for a while and trying to write again later. I think that is another reason I put this assignment off for so long. I made it seem harder than it really is and made myself have ""writer's block. ""  I seemed to not be thinking about anything so I couldn't just put my thoughts down. I was also worried about writing about the right things, but I realized it doesn't mater what I write about, it is just supposed to be what I am thinking. These twenty minutes have actually gone by pretty fast and I feel good about myself for just getting this assignment done and not procrastinating any more. I have definetly learned to do these assignments right away and that I don't have to think too much about them. I just need to write and not worry about how ""stupid"" I think they sound. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm feeling tired because I just ate and I'm concerned about finishing my chemistry homework for tomorrow. I need to go through two more chapters today and then review all six of them by Thursday for the test. I've fallen behind because I was unable to get anything done last weekend because I went back home to Houston. I also didn't get anything done yesterday because I again I had to go back to Houston for the funeral of one of my friends from high school that got killed. He was driving to Dallas to meet his roommate and had to swerve to miss a deer. It was pretty sad considering he had most of his life in front of him. His car flipped three times and he was crushed. I found out yesterday at the service that he had a rosary in his pocket when he died. interesting. I just noticed that the Astros won there ninth game in a row. I'm thinking about going to medical school after I got my degree in Architectural Engineering. I want to be a psychiatrist if I don't continue my study of Architectural Enginnering. I've got myself listed as being in pre-med. It so happens that 10 of my 14 hours also count towards the completion of pre-med. That was one of the best things that happened when I went to Freshman Orientation in the summer. When I went to see my advisor, she reentered my registration code and it will allow me to register for non-engineering required pre-med classes like biology, etc. Chemistry is pretty easy right now, it's just that we are going at a really fast pace. I hope that he (Dr. White) slows down pretty soon. At this rate, we will be through with the book a month early. He's already covered six chapters in two-and-half weeks. One of the other classes (the one with my roommate) is still on Chapter 1. I wonder what I'm going to do for dinner tonight. My roommate and I were trying to decide earlier if we should go out or if we should just make sandwiches in the dorm. At any rate, we both have homework and studying to do, so when and if we go it will probably be late. It doesn't really matter when we go since we don't have to get up early for class tomorrow. The only day I have to get up early is on Tuesday. I have a Geology for Engineers lab at 8AM. It's an easy lab, but the Geology for Engineers class itself looks difficult. I really like everyday except Tuesday because I can stay up late and study, or go out and not have to worry about getting enough sleep. It fits my schedule perfectly. I notice that my time is almost up. I have another one of these to do tomorrow. I should have got started sooner. I missed lunch today because I didn't get back into town until it was too late. After I got in, my roommate and I went to go workout. Sunday is usually our off day, but we decided to go max-out on the bench press. We usually go workout everyday except Sunday. Our dorm is located in a really good spot. We are right between the Stadium and Gregory Gym here at Moore-Hill. It sure does make for a long walk to some of my classes though. Oh well, time's up.       "
Tell me about yourself.,"thinking about how school is so different, so many people, so many things to do, all the perpetual motion. music is great, is it really what I want ot do?

"
Tell me about yourself.,"I think this is a really cool writing assignment. I like assignments that are easy yet mean something. I really hate this song I don't know why I am listening to it but I am too lazy to go change the station. and this new keyboard  is hard to type on it forces me to typer 'properly' I guess thats not abad thing. I like it when my roomate is not there sometimes and I am here alone I like being alone. I am currently having a brain blank. I am full because  I just ate lunch with my friends and now the bottom of this hard wook chair is pressing into my ankle bone and is killing me. ouch. I don't understand why my room is so cold good lord ihave to wear long sleeves to stay warm. I am very tired and I should sleep but I need to do this assignement which I have sadly put off already too lonf. haveing an 8am math clas sis not fun and I hate it. but the material is easy so far. I am bored and tired and I feel like going home but I can't my roomate is going home and I will be here alone all weekend. well we are rarely alone becase all of my freinds come to our dumb room all the time which sometime is annoying because we don't get stuff done soemtimes. this new song is itersting. I love music. I am sleepy. but man the lyrics are so dumb. what is the deal with all this insipid lyrics. I don't know what else to wreite. I think amybe my mind is slow because I just ate and I'm sleepy and I can't think very clearly. there really isn't much to think about. I am happy that my friend is coming to visit us here he lives off campus and we don't get to see him too often. but hes really cool. I feel happy to be able to see him. I feel comfortable with him. I really like my room. this commercial is really dumb I wonder if they even make impressions on anyone. I feel bad for putting this assginment off for so long. I don't usually do this I often wonder if  I will pull the 3. 5 I need this semester I hope I do. I think I am overall happy here in austin but I get lonely someimee even tho I am surrounded by my friends. but they are my high school friends. writing for 20 minutes about nothing in particular is harder than it sound si guess. I can't think of anything to write. my mind is blank. all I am thinking baout is typing. which I am not doing very well. I miss my parents! woah what a comment but I think I do. which is cool I guess but it has ony been like 3 weeks I don't know what to think I wonder what football game is next (NFL) I think we are playing the redskins soon. I think tis radio station is terrible. my roomate souild be be back in like 30 mih\nutes. man I dotn have anything to say. I think I maybe should have  done this assignemnet at a later tome when my brain isn't sleepy and my stomach isn't full from lunch. my floor is really dusty. gross. I have 4 minutes left. write weite write. I can't write anything. i am mentally singing the lyrics to this song and that is the only thing in my mind. I am going to try to go to the libraby tomm and study. I have parties to go to tonite and sat nite and an honors 'party' on sunday so I have to try to get as much done on sat. I feel like I am behind. college is hard as to where u will get behind and then wham it all sneaks up on u and u don't even realize it. but I love it so far and I can t imagine living this life for 4 years. thats a long time and I can see why people love these 4 years so much they are so random and fun. I can already tell that I am going to miss it during the summer and when I leave. I have 2 minutes left. I like having my own computer here I brought it over labor day weekend and I set it up, boucht the cables, etc all by myself which I have never doen before but I did it and its a cool sense of accomplishemnt. and I catually got the wthernet working even tho I had heard horror stories about it not working. its so fast. I like being self sufficient I thik its really good. I liked setting it up and makin it work myself. and it aint no I-Mac either where u just plug that mess in. oops times up. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I have decided to get a head start on my writing assignments so here I am writing about my thoughts. I am completely amazed that I can do this assignment on the internet. I mean five years ago who ever would have thought that you would be typing and submitting assignments off of the internet. Sometimes I wonder if the internet is just getting way to big. I hear people say that they think that it is going to get so big it will just collapse in on itself. Personally I do not completely understand what they mean by that. But it is kind of scary that any kid can go on the internet and get as much information about guns and hate groups as they want. I guess, like most things in life, the internet has its good points and its bad points. This writing assignment is my first writing assignment in college! It is so weird that I am now a college student. I still feel like I don't completely belong here. I have met a lot of cool people, but it definately does not feel like home. For some reason I have not come to realization yet that I am here for like seven more months. I still have no idea what I want to study. My major right now is microbiology. I was planning on becoming a doctor, but I'm not completely sure. I think that is what I want to be but I am interested in so many things. I'm taking an architecture class this semester just to see if I'll like that. I am good at math and science so I considered engineering. The only problem with engineering is that I really don't understand what an engineer does! I love science so I guess the medical field is good for me. Lately though I have been thinking of studying to become a veternarian. It involves science and animals and I absolutely love animals. The problem with deciding on a major is that I have no clue what each major entails. I guess I will have to go and research all the different majors I have been thinking of. This past june I went to this program called National Youth Leadership Forum on Medicine in Boston. I did not really want to go but I decided it would help me to make up my mind on becoming a doctor. It did not really do that, but it was an interesting experience. We went to Harvard Medical School and talked to med students there. That was interesting because I was expecting like a bunch of Einsteins sitting there just naming off different formulas and equations. Actually they were just normal people who did not seem any different from myself. Also at the Forum we went on hospital tours and some kids (I wasn't one of the lucky ones) got to shadow a doctor for a day. My friend Harris was able to actually watch open heart surgery. She said she saw the doctors flatline the heart (I guess the do that in open heart surgery) and then revive it. I was angry about that because I really wanted to see something like that. Instead, the hospital I went to, we had an eighty year old man take us on a hospital tour. Like I've never seen a hospital before! All in all the trip was fun because I at least got to see Boston. I had never been on the East coast before and it was really interesting. Boston is an amazing city but it is way too chaotic. I had been accepted at Boston University and I did not go there because it was way too expensive, and after actually going to Boston I was glad that I did not choose to go there. I mean, I love big cities and all, but Boston is just way too big. I would lose myself there. So here I am at UT. I am from Michigan and my final decision in a school was between UT and UofM. The only reason I came to UT was because my parents moved to Dallas a few weeks ago for my dad's job so I figured I might as well come to school here too. Being up in Michigan with my parents down here just seemed like it was way too far. I am ready to get away but not that far away. Texas is so different from Michigan. It is really hard to get used to. I have never seen a state show their state flag so much. It is cool, just different. I live in Michigan for 17 years and I don't even know what the state flag looks like. Everyone down here is really nice though. I like that a lot. I guess it is a southern thing, because people are really eager to talk to you. I can't believe how many people I have met and I have only been here for a week. I like UT a lot and I am glad that I chose this school. I am sure that after time I will feel like a true UT student. I guess that I just need to find my niche in the college scene. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am so tired right now that I don't want t go to class right now but instead just go to sleep in my nice and cozy bed. I wonder if this one girl likes me and it is driving me crazy because it is affecting my thoughts. I wish it would get cooler here; It is so hot and dry outside. I wonder if I have any other homework to do tonight because I want to just relax and play some basketball. My friend has just gotten on I'M and I want to talk to her but I hafta do this assignment instead. I just thought of something funny that happened in psychology class. I think I could have broken that lie detector test easy and in the mean time made people laugh too. Hmmm. I am getting hungry right now and now my roomate has just came in and keeps asking me what I am doing and now I can't concentrate anymore. I really enjoy watching Michael Jordan play basketball and I want to get that video that is out on his greatest moments. Dang, my room is messsy I really need to clean it up, oh well. I wonder if the MTV music awards are going to be any good tonight. sounds like it would be interesting for a big get together with friends and stuff. I just got out of my english class and that was so freaking boring and not worth my time. Well, I am running out of stuff taht I am thinking of. now I am hungry again. I am so hungry but the thought of eating jester food makes me think of really disgusting thoughts and many trips to the bathroom. That is why the bathrooms never smell good because the entire floor is doing the big number 2 all day long. Ok, now our hall is noisy becuase the cleaning lady is vacuuming and is getting really annoying. Well my 20 minutes are up and I am going to take a nap now.  "
Tell me about yourself.,"I feel very tired and alone. My room is too quiet to sleep, if that is possible and I don't have anyone to talk to since my roomate is out of town. The fan is on high right now to try to create some noise and keep me cool and comfortable, but the mugginess and isolation are too much to allow me to get any meaningful rest. It seems as though me clothes are permanently stuck to my chest and back. There is hardly any noise in my room besides the sound of the fan and the typing sound of my keyboard. I like to type as fast as possible so that the keys make almost a musical harmony. Besides the occasional loneliness, I am very happy with my new life here at college. My ex-girlfriend from high school came in for the weekend to see me, and I had a great time. however, I don't think that I would like for her to come to college with me. She goes to A&M and although I don't get to see her as much as I would like, I think that I saw her too much when we were together. It makes for sort of an awkward situation, but I have a lot of freedom, and at the same time, quite a bit of security knowing that she still cares about me and loves me. I don't like to say goodbye to her, though. She holds me and kisses me all weekend, but when it is time to go, she gets more depressed than she was when she hadn't seen me for weeks. Sometimes I get scared about her being so home-sick. She stopped eating for a while, but only told me about it today. It made me upset to think of someone who was too upset about college to eat. Everyone ends up saying college is the best time of their life, so I think that people should just forget about being homesick and try to get to the fun stuff as soon as possible. I like to have my own place, my own stuff, and a new group of friends. For the first time in my life, I can use self-control and discipline which I lacked back in high school. Back then, I figured that my parents could try to catch me if they could, but here, it's either be smart or lose out on a great opportunity to get an education and make connections. My parents do still have some say in my behavior though. They are the ones that tote most of the bills for me and recently rejected my request to join a fraternity. I was really excited to get my bid and go through the pledge stuff, knowing all along that my parents would make me wait out the first semester until joining. I wanted to make some new friends outside of the ten or so good friends that came here from high school with me. Oh well, I guess that parents know best, and I didn't challenge them too much with this decision. I'm sure that I could still join today, with the use of a little charm and a minor guilt trip. But, they are probably right on this one, so I'll let them win. The weather here seems to give me frequent nose-bleeds, unless I am just picking it more than usual (a little humor even though no one but me is listening). I love to joke around about things. The nose bleeds may be caused by some sort of anxiety or stress about being in a new place. I used to wake up with them all the time when I first moved from Michigan to Texas. I thought that it was the driness, but now that I have them again, you can't help but wonder. Time seems to go by quickly when I get to ramble on about life and myself. Does that mean that I am arrogant or self centered, that's probably it. The phone just rang and got me off track, but it's about time to go anyways. I try to correct all my mistakes during this writing even though I know that I don't have to. The work of good teachers or just a perfectionist, you make the call. Actually, I think that the bloody nose may have come from being hit during a game of basketball the other day. Maybe it is just a coincidence. Psychologists always over examine things I think. The answer the usually right in front of their nose, but they think about it too much and get too deep. Was that a pun? "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm sitting here writing for psychology class. I don't know what to write but oh well. Well I went to play tennis today because I'm going to tryout to be a walk-on for the team. I really don't knowif I will make the team but I'm going to try out anyway I just hope that I'm not the worst one out there. I wonder how and if I will be going to the OU and Texas A&M games. I really want to go. Man it would just be so cool to go. I would get to see all the good-looking football players (especially my man Major Applewhite). MAn, he is just so cute. I think about him a lot. I have developed  a little bit of an obsession with him. He just looks like he would be a cool person totalk to. I really want to write him a letter to tell him how big of  a fan I am. He has worked really hard to get where he is right now and he is just a big inspiration for me. Oh man to get to talk tohim would be the bomb. I don't know though because he has a girlfriend and that just isn't cool. Ah. My friend Matt e-mailed me today. He is just so weird. I don't know. I feel like I should go to Gregory to work out today but I just played tennis this morning. I don't know. My eyes are being really annoying. What? I am really straining to see the screen now. Man, the Backstreet Boys are really cool. I'm going to see there concert in New Orleans and it is going to be really cool. Ah, Nick, he looks good. I can;t believe that he did that announcement for the radio station here. I wonder if I will win that contest at Sears. Oh to go shopping with Nick. I wonder how Alisha is on the tennis team. Why am I thinking about her? I wonder what Robin is doing? Man, I must feel really guilty about Robin and Brooke because UI think aobut them a lot. I wonder what TAsha and Nance are doing. Oh and Jennifer too. Amy and her roommate sound like they are tight. I wonder what Austin College is like. Wow, it is a small school. I love U. t. it is the greatest. Yeah. My feet hurt from the way I ;m sitting. A hotel room for the OU game . I wonder how many people could fit in my room for the A&M game. I wonder if Kristine and Matt are going to want to go to the game. Yeah, I'll ask them tonight. What is in my eyes, they are going crazy. I wonder how much time there is left. Who just sneezed in the hallway. Oh, coughed. Wow! What am I going to write about next. I keep looking at the calender of Kristine's out of the corner of my eye. Yani is chewing her gum loud. I'm probably bothering her. Yeah, the PCL. What? Why am I thinking about the PCL. My nose itches. I have to go do the experiment tomorrow. I wonder what they'll make me do. I hope I won't be with weird people tomorrow. Somebody slammed the door. I wonder what and who is playing at the U. s. Open. I really hope that Andre Agassi doesn't win. My eyes are still going crazy. My ring is cool. I wonder who filed a complaint against us. My eyes. Who is talking out in the hall? I don't know. Yeah, I'm just sitting here typing. The microwave is freaking out. How do I type. I wonder how long this is going to be. My gum is kind of gross right nowbut now I;m popping it. Yeah bubbles. Oh that is the name of the group for the Texas A&m game draw. My eyes. I love to get the crap out of my eyes. TExas A&M. I really don't like them. I wonder if Yani is getting anything done with me typing away. The sink. What my eyes. I coughed because I couldn't breath really well. My eyes. Waht is my problem my arm hurts a little bit. The light keeps flashing really quickly . My fingers are gay. Yeah Dentene Ice and the Torch Parade. This computer looks funny,It looks like it has ears. and my wrists are really weird I wonder what kind of coffee shops are good. I want to go look at the one on the Drag. The Drag. Sometimes the people I see on the Drag are weird. They have weird color hair. I don't knwo. I really want a camera with a zoom lense so I can take cool pictures at the BSB concert. Airport The Drag. And I wonder if we are going to go in a hotel close to the arena. My eye. and yeah. I don't know what I ;m thinking. Some girls are out in the hall. "
Tell me about yourself.,"A of the present I guess the most common feelings I have are nervousness, excitement, sad, and happy. I imagine that these emotions are all quite normal, especially for a first year student. I guess the first two I will talk about are the ""better"" of the bunch: happy and excitement. The main reason I am feel these would have to be that for the first time in my life I have ""true"" responsibilty, there is not a parent or teacher looking over my shoulder to make sure I finish all my work and get it in on time, it is up to me. Secondly, I am lookinf forward to the learning style of college. No longer will I be bambarded with quesitons asking about pointless dates and useless facts, I will be asked to explain the theories and ideas taught in class. The lack of this is what I disliked about grade-school. I guess, at least in my case, for eahc ""good"" feeling there is an oppisite, ""not-so-good"" emotion. Most of the people I have talked to that went off to college were the most nervous about the simple fact of being away from home, ""being on your own. ""  I have friends as close as 20 minutes from home feeling the same thingas those 3000 miles away. But, at least as far as I can tell, I am not that home sick. THe part about being away from home is the fact that most of my friends are going to school at home. Granted I have a few friends going off to colleges that aren't at home or isn't UT, but the most part if my friends are not in San Antonio (home), then they are up here at UT, in fact my roommate has been a friend of mine since 8th grade. Even on top of the ""friends"" factor, the one that gets me the most is that my girlfriend is still at home. That would have to be the hardest part about coming to UT and the reason for the most nervousness and most about of sadness. Lucky for us though San Antonio is not that far, coparatively speaking, so the amount of time we can spend together is greater than that of my friends who went to other states and have a boyfriend or girlfriend in San Antonio. Although I am in the Longhorn Band, so that, at least for the fall, is eating up most of my time, but the time we do have together we enjoy a great deal, and both of our families support us so that helps considerably. So I guess all-in-all there are a lot of good emotions and feeling in me involving the change to ""college-life"", but nontheless there are still those ""not-so-good"" ones residing in me. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Wow, I can't believe I'm finally here. I've waited so long to get to the point that I am in my life right now, and now that I'm finallly here I feel like I really am not. I return to that same question that I've always grappled with. What is my purpose??  If I was religious in any sense then I might be compelled to believe in the ""obvious. ""  But I am not and therefore I must pretend to be purposeful and hope that in the end my lufe will be fulfilling. What did I throw away with Mike?  Or did I throw it away?  Only time will tell I guess. I will say that I have never known such unconditional love as that which I had from him. I crave excitement though. A restless mind, I suppose. And a restless heart. One day I will meet my match I feel. Someone who will mirror me in my restlessness. we will feel out the world together and find happiness in adventure and passion. False idealism perhaps - or perhaps not. I burn with anger for what happened to Amber. Anger for whoever violated her and anger in myself for not seeing it coming. Let me correct myself - anger for actually seeing it coming and not doing anything about it. I've seen this coming to her for a year at least. And I never said anything to her. I learn from others, but I suppose others don't always learn from me. Thank God she's ok. perhaps it was a blessing in disguise. Well, a new start and new people await here. I feel like the world has handed me a gift and now it is my responsibility to embellish upon it. It's all there on a silver platter for me to grapple with, and I DO intend to grapple. I'm putting in my two weeks notice on August 1st. Counting down the days. My job has become such a headache. The money is good, the hours suck, and now the people suck. Why does money mean so much to me?  I feel like a green-eyed monster and I'm only 18 years old. I'm already thinking about investing. Thinking about doing a little research and putting my money where my mouth is. I plan on being in the six digits by the time 30 rolls around. What do you see when you look into people's eyes?  Eyes are the windows to the soul. I can read so much into a person by looking at their eyes while they talk. So what am I doing with blue contacts?  What am I trying to hide?  What do I want to become?  I think I would trust my warm brown eyes over my glacier-blue contacts any day. All in the fun I guess. A mystery to others and maybe even to myself. Casper is so peaceful. I wish I were a dog sometimes. To be caressed and loved all day and to give unconditional love without material or superficial worries must be pure emotional ectasy. Not a care in the world. My bed is calling.   "
Tell me about yourself.,"It is really hot in here. I wish someone would turn the ac down. I hope I didn't miss anything in Calculus today, but I can get the notes from Nicole. I need to do so much stuff this week with little time to do it in. I need to email David and reply to all of the emails I got yesterday. I need to hang up my pictures in my room, but don't have anything to hang them with. I still haven't cashed the check from mom, and I'm running low on money. College is sooooo expensive and there's always too much to do. I hardly have time to do everything that I need to do. I have to pay for all of the clubs I want to join and speaking of that, I have to write essays and fill out applications for TX sweethearts, spirits, the children's hospital, and go to a meeting for AED. I have a meeting at the ADPi house tonight and Wed night!!!!  All these meetings--at least one everyday/night. I also have so much chemistry homework tonight. I keep falling behind in all of my classes. As soon as I catch up in one of them, I fall behind in another. But last night I did a lot of homework, so that helped a little. You know, everytime I am trying to write a thought, twenty more come into my mind. I wonder who looks at these writings and if they get bored of hearing everyone's thoughts. I have to do seven minute abs tonight because my roommate and I are going to for two weeks to see if we can get a six pack. My fingers are starting to tingle from typing so much, so fast. I wonder what's for dinner tonight at the sorority house. I hope it's something healthy. I haven't been eating very healthy since I left home. Not that I ate healthy before but at least I had complete meals, not just pizza or junk food. what else am I thinking of?. maybe if I look around my room. i really need to clean my crap off the floor and desperately need to do laundry. I normally go home to do it but I do not have time to go all the way home and waste time there, waiting for it to dry like last time. although I did promise my brother that I'd bring him up to my dorm to check it out since he hasn't seen it yet. and I really want to see my dogs. I think I miss Bear more than anyone else. probably because I cannot talk to him over the phone or email him like I can my parents. russ calls me nonstop and really gets on my nerves. I feel bad when I'm mean to him but I have so much stuff to do and don't really have time to talk about nothing to him. uh, oh, my sweetmate just got home from yesterday. She stays at her boyfriend's house almost every night. gretchen told me that she came in at 7am this morning making tons of noise. she doesn't care about other people and is so self-centered. I hope she doesn't come in here and read this. that'd be very bad. I need to go to TOPS to get my pictures from last friday night. I had so much fun and want something to remember the night by. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, since my friend just told me how she neglected to get us these free random  glow in the dark condoms, I've got sex on the brain, not that I've even had sex before. It's just one of those things that jumps in my head two or three times a day. I think it's because it's one of those unknown things I haven't experienced yet. I really wish I was back at home sitting on my bed, with my dog at my feet, waiting for my brother to come in and keep me up talking about my poor relationship problems which I still to this day haven't figured out. I miss him, my boyfriend/ friend/ player/ love or whatever. All I know is that I had fun with him no matter what was going on in my life. He could and still can always make me laugh. I miss that. I just plain miss him. And I'm not saying that I never once thought of having sex with him but it was never a real issue. He made me smile and never upset me. Well, that's not completely true. sometimse he upset me but it wasn't his fault. Unfortunately, I loved him a lot more than he loved me even though he really and truly loved me a lot. sometimes  I wonder if he is gay. I know that sounds odd but maybe   . no forget it. I'n so exhausted and all I want to do is go to sleep in my own bed under a real homy roof. I know it sounds funny becaouse they're probably all asleep but I wonder what they're doing- mY family and John and my other long lost friends who off at some far away college. poor Jonathan is out at sea. I hope it's not raining on him. THe food here is good but I don't like having some one tell me when I have to eat and when I can't. There is no refrigerator with Blue Bell stuffed in the back. And most of all, there is no Arlington Dance Academy. Oh, guys I wish I was there to teach my little kids and have them run up and hug my leg. I wish I had my senior class back cause I have so many great ideas from new pop songs I've heard here in Austin. Why can't I just skip the whole college thing. I know ican do it and I have the abiltiy and the committment to finish, Ijust don't think I need to . I want to run a dance studio  . I need to be going to conventions and new York and watching my previous dance instructor run the agenda and show me the accounting not learning about some stupid coorporations that I'll never want a job from or need an interview from. I just want to do what I've been doing best for the last 15 years and that is choreograph real dance in my own studio with my own ideas and expectations. It's my dream and its getting away from me. school seems second now and I really don't care. I've put it first most of the rest of my life. I did my 18 years now I want my career, my dream. I still want to dance myself but that is possible except not here in Austin where most of the studios are for elementary and the directors are real snots. people should want you to dance with them especially if you have a good attitude. but my bed is calling to me and I still have some very important e-mails to take care of. it's so nice to know that some people care enough at least to type. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I hope that it doesn't matter that I do not capitalize anything. I seem to type better and more ""stream of conscious""-like when I don't have to worry about anything. I like it here at ut. I like how my classes are big. I thought that it was going to be a really big change for me. I went to private school all of my life until right now. my classes were no bigger than 25 people. in fact my psychology class is almost bigger than my entire high school. the hardest part for me so far has been homesickness. I really do like it here. but this whole independence thing is new to me. this week has been a ton better than last week was. I am a little worried about tomorrow because I have two quizzes - one in chemistry and one in medical terminology. they shouldn't be too hard because I've been studying all week. first tests are always worrisome I think. I am going back home to san antonio tomorrow. I can't wait to see my dad. he has been in la for a week or so and I haven't seen him or talked to him. when I think of my dad I always think of this past summer because we would always watch the atlanta braves games and espn baseball tonight together. I have always been a big baseball fan. I never wanted to play softball or baseball, I just really like to watch it. I have realized that watching baseball with my dad at night was how we bonded. he is not a big talker. he is not a very sensitive person either. throughout my life I have never really had anything in common with my father until baseball. I guess the biggest thing has also been me coming to ut. he came here and graduated from law school over 20 years ago. he was so proud that I decided to come here. I love to see him happy. my boyfriend is still in san antonio. he doesn't admit that he didn't want for me to like it here. but I know him better than he knows himself. we've been dating for over three years now. it doesn't seem like that long. I love him. he has tried everything to make me feel better, concerning homesickness that is. he calls me every night and tells me how his day was and then asks me about mine. he is the best thing that has ever happened to me. it's kind of scary though. I want to spend the rest of my life with him. but I am only 18 years old. how do I know for sure that he is the one?  I guess it is just another mystery of life. last week when I went back home I went out with my boyfriend on friday night. I didn't think that it was going to affect my mom so much. she was so hurt that I wanted to go out with him and not spend my time with her. it's hard though. being torn between your boyfriend and your family. but I spend all day saturday and sunday with my family. my mom apologized to me about how she acted. I told her that it was hard for me to choose and that I felt torn between the two. she understood and now everything is great. communication is the key to improving and understanding all relationships. that is what I think anyways. well my twenty minutes are up. I have to go meet my roommate and then we are going to go eat. until the next writing assignment. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm not totally sure what I'm supposed to be writing about. I will be glad to get this assignment out of the way, because I have so much stuff to do. My classes aren't too bad, but there's just lots of outside assignments to do. I feel like I'm always busy, especially with being in a sorority. I love the one I'm in, because the girls are all so genuine and sweet, but it really takes up a lot of my time. We have 2 meetings every week and then other activities. I don't feel like it's possible to do all of that, study, and make time for a social life. I have been having a lot of fun, though. My mom thinks I party too much. She doesn't really understand that I do work on school stuff, and I do know that classes are the real reason I am here in the first place. I know that I can't go out every night. I don't think I'll have too much of a problem, because I can balance everything and plan ahead if I know something big is going on over the weekend. My seminar class is kind of annoying. It's a stress-management course, and I picked it because it seemed like an easy one, and I really wanted a seminar. Everything's pretty much common sense. We have all these handouts and activities on managing time, organizing, and stuff like that. I do stress sometimes, and I always have a lot on my mind, but I don't let it bother me. I'm very organized, and I always find  a way to do everything that I need to and still make plenty of time for myself and fun stuff. My room mate does stress a lot though. She's always a little edgy and panicky. She kind of thinks about everything all at once and worries about it instead of getting something done and out of the way. She kind of looks at the negative side of things sometimes too. She's one of those ""the glass is half empty"" kind of people. It bothers me sometimes, because I like to be positive. I'd rather be getting things out of the way, then focusing on everything at once. I also don't think there's a point in worrying about something unless you have to. I'd rather just wait and see what happens. I really hope the guy comes to hook up the Ethernet in my room soon. I've had so many problems with my computer, and I hate having to come to the lab. It's just down the hall, but it would be nice to stay at my desk. It'd be more comfortable too, and convenient. My dad bought my computer when I moved in, but it had the wrong kind of Ethernet card installed. Now it has the right one- as long as James comes to hook me up!  I hope there are no other problems, because then I won't know what to do. I'm so illiterate when it comes to computers, and I hate that because I don't understand how to fix things--or even how to tell what's wrong. I think it's pretty cool how we can just type all of this on the computer and not even have to turn in a paper. I was kind of surprised. I wonder if everything will be like that in the future; if all work will end up being done over the Internet and just mailed to teachers. It's definitely less of a hassle. I'm excited about this weekend. I'll get to see a lot of my family and some friends back in Houston. I really want to see Corey. He's such a great guy, and I think I  really hold back from getting too close to him. I guess it's because I knew I'd be moving, and I don't want to be attached to someone that I can't always see. It'll be nice to see him though. I might get to see one of my best friends too. She goes to SFA, but she'll be home this weekend too. I think she's having tons of fun at college too. I'm definitely glad I came here. Sure it's big, but it would bother me if it wasn't. I'm having fun, and there's always something going on. I love that about big  cities. I can't imagine living in a small town and not having anywhere to go. I would get so bored. I guess it would be different if you grew up  there, though.     "
Tell me about yourself.,"My thoughts are all jumbled right now. My life is so different now than it was 2 months ago. I had no idea that leaving home and beginning a life on my own would change me so much. For years now, I've anticipated this change in my life. I've so wanted to be on my own. not because there's anything wrong with my life at home, but because I've always been an independent person. i've always felt I needed to do things for myself. take care of myself. not be such a burden. Today. tons of things have gone through my mind. Most of the day. it has been sleep. I love Saturdays. i love to sleep and not have to worry about getting up to do anything. But. at times. i think about home. the things I'm missing. and the things they're missing about me. I think about my little brother. and how I'm missing him grow up. I know I've only been gone for three weeks, but he has changed in my eyes so much in those three weeks. I think about the birthdays I'm missing because I just can't make it home every weekend. And I think about my friends. my best friend, Amber. how I miss talking to her about EVERYTHING. How I wish she were here to experience all the stuff that I'm experiencing right now. I think a lot about my ""boyfriend"". i put it in quotes because we're not exclusive anymore. we're ""dating other people"". i think about how much I miss him. his eyes. his laugh. his attention. But today when I woke up, the first thoughts that came to my head was. Nikki, you have two papers to write for Psychology. better get it done. Nikki, you have to mail you're grandmother a birthday card. you're going to miss her birthday this year. Nikki, you have to mail your paycheck home so Mom can deposit it for you. Nikki, you have no money left from that paycheck. so STOP SPENDING. Life is so different for me now. i've got so much to think about everyday. like I haven't done laundry in a week and a half. and I'm running out of clothes. i have to get that done too. At times, I miss having my mom there to remind me of everything. to tell me to do stuff. but at times, I don't miss that. i'm glad I'm getting things done without having to be told. I think about other stuff too. like. where am I going to live next year?. am I going to be friends with the same people?  I've been so lucky up to this point. i've got the greatest friends. they'd do anything for me and each other. I love them. and I've only known them for three weeks. I've got to think about work too. how different it is from work at home. how there are just those days when I just don't want to go. and how I'm so glad that I get a break today and don't have to go in. Don't get me wrong. i love my job. it's just. i feel overwhelmed at times. My friends are going this way. and that way. and none of them have jobs. when I'm working almost every weeknight. Sometimes I feel deprived. of there time. of my own time. but then I remember that I am now a responsible adult. and I am doing things for myself. I have to find a church down here in Austin, too. I've never had the experience of doing that before. i've always been a member of the same church. always been around the same people. coming from a small town, that happens. But God is a big part of my life. and I've got to find a church. i worry about that a lot. It's something new for me. and I'm scared. Right now. i'm thinking about how cold it is in this stupid room. and how it didn't do me any good to shave my legs. oh, and how cold it's going to be this winter. so glad I bought a down comforter. Well. that's about all I'm thinking about lately. so I guess this brings my paper to an end. Thanks for listening. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I don't know how to start a paper like this but I'll do my best. I really miss my mom and my sister, but most of all I miss my boyfriend Michael. He means so much to me and I feel as if our relationship is falling apart because I live a 100 miles away. I don't know how to get over this feeling of loneliness. I meet a lot of people but I still always think of him. He is so understanding too. He said he would understand if I wanted to date other guys. But to be honest with you, I don't. I know I am too young right now to know if my feelings are real but no one up here even compares to him and that really scares me. I cry every night because I miss him so much. I'm tired of crying and feeling scared. I want Michael to be here with me but that is impossible. I went home this past weekend and I realized how much I loved it. I never wanted to come back to Austin. I hate it here. Nothing is secure and there is no one to count on. I wish I could go back home but I can't. I would transfer somewhere closer but I am in one of the top business schools and if I get out then I might never get back in. Don't get me wrong, this is an outstanding school, I am just so homesick. I guess in time though it will get better. Everyone says that the first few months are hard for freshmen. It is such a big adjustment to make. I just hope I will adjust. What if I never do?  Then what happens?  Am I to be unhappy forever?  That is how I feel right now. That I will never be happy again as long as I am here and Michael is down there. Maybe I will feel like that for 2 more years, maybe I won't. One can never know. Sometimes I write poetry to ease my mind. I find that it really helps me express my feelings. Whoever is reading this, do you know of a poetry class or something that I could take?  I think I would really like that. I also want to  learn how to play the piano. Then Michael could play the guitar and I could play the piano. That would be interesting. I wish Christmas holidays would come so I could go home for an extended period of time. I never thought that I would miss it this much, but I do. I think I want to live in my hometown when I grow up. It is such a nice town. Everybody knows everybody and it is so safe. And there I won't be alone. I hate being alone. I'm tired of being alone. I have friends here but they can only do so much. It takes that extra person to really get you over the hump, unfortunately he does not live here. Maybe someday, we can be together again. At least that is what I dream of at night. He is the only one that makes me truly happy. well, time is up! "
Tell me about yourself.,"well I just got back from my home town in huntsville today. I went down there for my granny and paw paws fiftieth wedding anniversary. I think today was the hardest move I ever made. it as my first trip home since I moved  down here. the first time wasnt as hard as today was. I guess I realized that I don't live there anymore. when I was leaving I thought to myself I have to go home. but this doesn't feel like home to me, huntsville does. I had a blast while I was there. I got to see most of my friends including my girlfriend which I was basically forced to break up with because of my move cause everyone knows that long distance relationships don't work. but it was like nothing had even changed. I had so much fun with her and with my old friends. I honestly didnt want to come back today. I cried the most I've ever cried in my life today. the hardeset thing for me was to see my mom cry. I think she realized that I was actually gone as well. I could also tell my dad was fighting back the tears. the only other time I have ever seen my dad almost close to crying was when his grandmaw died. me and him are best friends. he told me he loved me today which I havent heard out of his mouth in a while because you know,  were ""men"". as I pulled out of my driveway, my mom and dad were hugging each other,  they have never done anything but scream and yell at each other since my 18 years of living there. I burst into tears at the sight and drove off with that pain in youre neck you get when you try to fight back tears. this still wasnt as bad as when I had to tell my exgirlfriend bye again. she was the last person I saw before I left and I spent about an hour over there. we talked about how much fun we used to have. I wish I could see her more often. she gave me my birthday present today because I wont be home for it. she wrote me the sweetest card  and I started to cry again. then I opened the present and it was a fairly expensive watch and I burst into tears again. I realize how much she really is in love with me and I wish I was there to share that with her. its going to be even harder to get usec to living down here now. to end with a good note every one I visited sent me lots of food back. thanks for listening, I feel a lot better now. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well,after I finally figured out how to get into all of this computer stuff,I'm going to calm down by writing. The first thing comes to my mind is I'm wondering whether I should go out tonight or not. I'm determined to finish all of my homework for this week and I'm sure that I'll finish everything by ten or ten thirty. But' my body really doesn't need for me to go out, but by ten or eleven o'clock I get really antsy. I'm proud of myself today because I took care of a lot of stuff that needed to do. I woke up at eleven, which is later than I wanted but I got moving right away. I went to TOP and bought all of my pictures and then I went to my Art History class. After class, Iwent with my two friends Sara and Whitney to University Realtors to figure out our living situation at Villas next year. It turned out that the apartment we wanted had already been taken after the guy said he would reserve it for us. So we got really mad at him and we worked it oit that we would move into the six bedroom apartment rather than the five bedroom apartment. Therefore, we had to get two more roommates. So we went over to Joanie's place and got Erin Vaughn and Joanie to live with us. It actually turned out for the better because the six bedroom place is for 8 people but since he screwed us over, we get to have nine people. With nine people, the rent ends up being cheaper. Since I'm sharing a room with my friend Jennifer, it'll be cheaper for us. I'm really excited about the girls I'll be living with next year because they are all really cool. My roommates for next year at Villas will be Anne, Carolyn, Jennifer, Paige, Sara, Whitney, Joanie, and Erin. I also had Ed on my mind today. He's my new boyfriend and I'm just crazy about him. Everybody says how great it is for me because he is such a nice guy and a gentlman. We just met about two and a half weeks ago and we were crazy about each other right away. Everyone is so surprised that I didn't know him before because we are so close already. Everyone asks how we met: he is my good guy friend's roommate. My guy friend is Will and right when Will moved into Towers, he wanted me to come over and see his place. So I went over there and I distinctly remembering Ed answer the door and I had met him for the first time. I thought he was so cute and we just talked for alittle while and our personalities seemed to click. Later that night, Ed called and invited me to the football game. Then we just started talking more and more and we just fell for each other. I've already screwed up a little bit in our relationship and I was terified that he would leave me. But, he forgave me and took me back right away and I'm so incredibly thankful. I never want to feel that bad again in my life. That's when I knew that I really was head over heels for him when I was terribly depressed over such a small mistake. I hope it works out for the future and all of my friends just tell me to grasp on to the now with your boyfriend and not to look ahead or else it could end up causing problems. I'm just so anxious about everything because this is my first real boyfriend ever. Well, my twenty minutes is up. Bye. "
Tell me about yourself.,"These past couple of weeks I have felt kind of out of place. Not that I haven't been having fun and meeting new people just that it is taking some time to adjust to everything. I sometimes think that I have too much going on and that I need to quit something. Between school, Texas Pom, and soroity I am always on the go, and I never have time to just sit and relax. However, when I get a little time to just relax, all my friends start to come in my room and ask me to go do something or just talk. I don't want to be rude about it, because I don't know all them well enough to know how they would react. For example, I've been feeling sick lately and I really should stay home and get some rest tonight, but all of my pledge sisters are going to a mixer tonight, and I feel that I should go with them. I don't really want to go, but I feel like I need to meet some more people and not let my pledge sisters down. I know that they understand, but I also feel that they might think that I don't like to go out and have a fun time with them. These thoughts have also led me to revaluate why I did Texas Pom. We have to practice so much a week that I have to miss some of my pledge meetings and give up time that I could use to study or rest. However, I love the girls on the squad and all of the fun that we've had together so far. Also, the games are such a rush and make me feel so privalleged to be out there on that field. I would feel like I was letting the whole team down if I quit something that I've been committed to a lot longer than my soroity. Plus my coach has been so understanding lately with the adjustments that I'm going through, that it would be hard for me to tell him that I might want to quit. I guess I just need to sit down and eveluate all of the options that I have right now, or maybe just give it another couple of weeks to get adjusted before I make a decision. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, I just got back from my Zeta meeting. It was cool. After the meeting, we went to this show where this guy hypnotized people. It was so funny!  Some of my pledge sisters where some of the subjects. It was hillarious to see them and the funny things he made them do. I can't believe I waited until now to write this. I'm usually the type of person who gets things done ahead of time. I think all of this freedom makes me feel like I have nothing to do. I missed a homework assighnment in Kinesiology the other day. I couldn't believe it. Tomorrow we're going to have this ""relationship talk"" with the Delts. It's going to be really fun, I can't wait. This time is going by really slowly, I just know that I'm going to run out of stuff to say. I'm really hungry, I haven't eaten since 5:00. I've noticed that I eat more often now. I think it's because I work out (or try to) three times a week. I always feel so much better when I work out. Hopefully, I'll be able to keep it up for the rest of the year. The dreaded ""freshman fifteen""  is not going to get me!  This Thursday, I have a meeting with my doctor about my knee. It's been giving me problems. I had surgery on it last October. The crappy thing is that my other knee is starting to feel the same way. God, why was I born with ghetto knees?  Okay, I feel like I've been writing forever and it's onlt been 10 minutes. I am dreading all of the writing I'm going to have to do next semester. English is going to suck next semester!  I've never been any good at English. I don't enjoy it in the least bit. On the other hand, I love this psychology class!  Every day I get to come, I look forward to it. Our professor is hilarios. I don't know what it is that makes him such an awesome teacher, he just is. Every day, I come home and tell my roommate all that we discussed that day. I enjoy reading our textbook, I actually find the information interesting!  (much unlike my other classes)  I wish Psychology was a more job-promising field. I would definately look into it if it was. Okay, five more minutes, I think I can BS my way through it!  I'm waiting on my this guy Kevin to call me. I'm not sure what exactly he is to me. We're dating, and we wouldn't date anyone else, but I feel funny calling him my boyfriend. Okay, my roomate just blared the TV. If I did that while she was trying to do homework, she would eat my head off!!!!!  Okay this last minute will be used to sign off. I wish all of my writing assignments were this easy!  There, D-O-N-E! "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now I am sitting at home checking my email and different things. A lot of things are running through my head. I need to read for my classes, I need to go to work, and I need to clean the house. I am interested in this psychology class and I like Dr. Pennebaker a lot. He is funny and keeps class interesting. I look forward to class and believe that I will learn a lot. My sensations at the moment include being extremely tired. I am worried about getting everything done and think that I have to much to do. I am very happy it is the weekend and am so glad I don't have class on Friday and this weekend on Monday. I am excited about this weekend because my small town is having a picnic and they are always a lot of fun. I am sorry that I will miss the UT football game against Stanford but the last one I went to was extremely hot and I was drenched with sweat. I had a lot of fun in spite of the heat though. I love the spirit of the fans and feel proud that I attend a university with so much pride and support. I love to be amidst the fans and hear the roar of the games in general. I saw so many burnt orange shirts in the stands that I couldn't believe it. It is almost solid burnt orange with an occassional white or some other color shirt. I don't need to buy any more UT clothing, etc. I have to much stuff already, but every time I go into the bookstore I buy something with UT on it. I feel sorry for whoever has to read this or check it over because it is boring and I don't even know if I am doing this right. I am just writing what I am thinking and it is turning out to be a cool assignment. I think it has been about twenty minutes so I am going to end the assignment. I enjoyed this and it helped me to write these things out. It felt like I was talking to someone who was a very good listener, even though it was a computer screen and  no one will probably read it anyway.   "
Tell me about yourself.,"I really don't have many thoughts right now, other than the fact that I get to go home this weekend. I really can't wait, and what is this song going on behind me?  Anyway, like I was saying, I get to see Jenny, she's my girlfriend. I miss her so much, but that's okay. I think about her constantly. For example, when I am in classes, I think about her all the time. No offense Dr. P. , but I do!  Anyway, I love this song that's on right now. I really wish these people would quit Instant Messaging me!  I get so tired of hearing my little ding in the back going off telling me someone is there!  Oh well, I guess it's my fault for being so damn friendly. That's okay though. I miss my little sister. I can't wait to see her. She is the most prescious thing to me right now, other than my studies. Who the heck is blaring their music. I am trying to do my work and they think everyone has to hear their damn music. That's okay though. I understand, I like music. Man, there isn't much room on this little space to write for twenty minutes. You should really reconsider and make us write for like ten minutes instead of twenty. That's okay though. I don't mind. It's not like I'm whining or something. Anyway, where is Russel?  He never has this late of a day. Hmm, I wonder. Wow, Britney Spears is so pretty. Just too bad everyone has to dog her because she's successful and they aren't. I hate it when people do that. Oh well, I guess it's what makes the world go round. I don't know, I don't have all of the answers. I guess really no one does. I wonder why Deena decided to talk to me of all people?  That was really weird. She's pretty though. I wouldn't mind getting to know her as a friend. She's really sweet, or so it seems. I love meeting new people. I guess that is why I chose this school, well at least one of my many reasons. I love college. So far, that is. I can't wait to meet more people. Wow, my twenty minutes is almost up. I can't believe it. I really can't wait to go home. I'm not homsick, but I am really wanting to see Jenny. See, there I go again, thinking about her. I can't stop thinking about her. I love her with all of my heart. I would never do anything to hurt her. I know that she knows that and I know that she wouldn't hurt me either. Man, these chairs hurt. I wish I had a cushion for it. That's okay though. I am thristy now. I need some lemonade. I guess I'll have to make some. I'm out. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I suppose that the first sensation that comes to mind is contentment because Janet Jackson is playing on the radio. I love Janet Jackson. A lot of times I tell people that I'm obsessed with her music, but I really don't think that is true. I exaggerate too much, I think. I guess I just want people to be impressed with what I'm saying. I don't care if they like it or not - I don't care if they like me or not. In fact, in a lot of ways, I would rather them not like me. I know that is completely abnormal. MOst people strive for acceptance or whatever. I would rather people not like me. That is, except for the few friends I have. I have about ten friends, I would say. This is fine with me. I would rather have ten friends that I know and trust than have a hundred that I barely know. I hate the concept of accquaintances. I realize that sometimes it is necessary, but it just seems plain stupid to me to call people who are really accquaintances, friends. A friend is sacred. Family is important and all. They are the people who are stuck with you no matter what, bascially. A true friend chooses to be stuck with you for the rest of time. That is sacred. Without my ten friends, I would be lost. If they decided that they didn't like me, I wouldn't know what to do. However, people I don't know - I could care less. I don't like meeting new people. I guess maybe that's because I am uncomfortable with change. New people change so many things. I realize the value in making new friends - I really do. but, I think its better to meet someone as it happens - by chance, so to speak. Consciously making an effort to go out and meet people - I think that undermines the meaning and value of friendship. If someone said to me - I'm going to go out and meet friends today, I wouldn't even know what to say. WHAT?  That is beyond the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. I can only shake my head and wonder what goes on inside that person. That statement makes it sound so easy - just go out and meet friends. How simple. I feel bitter right now. I don't think I should feel bitter. It feels wrong, somehow, so now I feel guilty. I'm bitter because it has always been a strugle for me to meet people that I like that like me back. Or so I always thought. In actuality, it was always in my mind. And now that I realize that a lot of people would like me if I gave them the chance to, that scares me. Like I said, I like having only ten friends. It works for me. I can't take on having many  more friends - I would strecth myself to thin. So, one would say, just keep some close friends and the others not so close. I do that now, to some extent, with my ten friends. If I did it with more - some would become accquaintances. Like I said, I hate the concept of accquaitances. And so, it all becomes a circle. Most things are circles, though. If you can't come to a conclusion, it is probably a circle. Circles are so hard because one is constantly doubting his/herself. Should I be on this side or the other?  I suppose that one just has to make a choice, a commitment, and stick to it. Faith - such a hard thing. Especially when one has to have faith in oneself. It's so much harder that it sounds. Perhaps it is the thing that humans strive for or should strive for. I don't know. I won't even go into anything like that. The meaning of life, etc. I don't know enough for that - not even close. That's okay, I can wait. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I feel a little tired. It is cold in here. Maybe I'm tired because its cold in here. Why a writing this paper?  Am I going to be judged on what kind of person  I am by these rambling thoughts that I type down. I'm still mad that I lost my remote control to my reciever on the move up here. It will probably cost around  30 dollars to get a new one. You know I found it impossible to clear your mind of all thought, because to be able to do this you have to be thinking to remind yourself your not supposed to be thinking. Dad's birthday is this weekend. Probably going to go see him. I wonder how the new restraunt is doing. I wonder how Mark likes running it. I'm getting kind of hungry. To bad there is nothing to eat though. Man I need some money. Maybe I'll get a job working on my days off so that I can have enough money to eat. I still need to read chapter 2 in my psychology book. Its a pretty cool book I like the qoutes by the different people. This computer is under 1. 5 tons I would say. Man I need to get out of the house. All I do everyday go to class come home eat study watch tv go to sleep. And then the next day get up clean the place up eat study watch tv study shower well I guess I shower the day before two and then go to sleep. UT is very different. I had 40 people in my senior class and everybody was extremly friendly. Here everbody is different. Maybe they weren't raised the same as me to be polite to everybody. That alright. I'm sure I'll find some friends that have the same views as me. Whats the deal with all my classes talking about how depressed you are supposed to get. Its kinda like they are telling you that if you don't become depressed then you arent normal. Maybe I will, just to be like everyone else. Nah. Maybe I should start lifting weights again or swim. Man this is weird. I keep thinking in the back of my head that this is supposed to be stream of concious but for some reason I keep trying to make sense on way I saying. Damn that really scared me the dang air conditioner just made a helluva loud noise. That reminds me of the questionare that I had to fill out for the experimental research for this class. Are you afraid of spiders do you constantly look for spiders do you dream of spiders thats crazy. Hey that reminds me of Saturday Night Live. Thats Crazy. That pretty funny. Mispelled thats. Oh well. One minute left tick tock tick tock  tick tock oh no time has stopped 2:34 AM that is what it says why is it when you notice time it goes by so much slower ding ding 2:35 our time here is done. "
Tell me about yourself.,"strees is this what college is really about. I never thought it would be this stressful especially this early in the game reading, class, reading, andmore reading. I never read this much in highschool therewas never any need I always found a way to float by but now Ihave to there isno more timeto fake it this is for real this is the big leagues as my dad would say. Speakin of which I remeber the car ride here the thousands of adages and proverbs and basically bullcrap that decided was something that was entirely neccesary and vital for me to hear I suppose he hadthe right to afterall he is paying for this and if I SCREW up then he will be the onetopay for the mistake therefore PREESURE and extreme amout of it for what reason it makesmewonder if anything including a college degree is worth that much in thegrand scheme of thingsafter all cameron's dad never went to college he decided to persue his dreams and enjoy life and heseems tobedoingjust fine but that not the Oleniczak way theOleniczak way is to pressure ourselvesto death that is to say that we must always succeed and at all costs wether it means dedicating our lives to something we hate orpretending that we really enjoy those things which will make us successful or at least acceptable to therest of our family because afterall god knows that if Anut Pat's kids succeed furthur in life then we do then we are obviosly not worthy who am I kidding they arenotthat bad after all I kow they love ilove them and they may putsome pressure on me but I know that deep down they are probably in the right despite that I am right where I want to be on my own away from home and surrounded by girls sounds like utopia if you put it in that perspective I guess I would not haveit any other way this is what I want and this is what I am going to do    "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am sitting in front of my computer right now thinking about how I have so many things to do and I am not sure how to organize my time sufficiently. I cannot decide what my priorities are yet. Of course classes are the most important part of being at college, but there are various clubs and organizations that I am interested in from the description on flyers and posters. I don't know what these clubs are really like though. It is the people that makes an organization fun and you cannot tell what people are like from a flyer. I am really hungry right now. I hate that the dining hall is closed for dinner on Sundays, not that the food is really that good anyway. Wait this isn't Sunday, this is Monday. We just didn't have class because it is Labor Day. That will mix me up all week. I will be a day behind. It is hard to let your thoughts flow naturally when you are thinking about thinking. I am so glad that Lindsey came up to visit me this weekend. It feels so good to laugh with someone that already knows you. You don't have to try or think, everything just flows so naturally. I know that it takes time to develop a friendship like this and I cannot expect to just make instant connnections like that in a new place, but I am not good with all that patience and effort. I can't wait until the pizza gets here. I don't feel bad about eating unhealthy food because I have to walk so much around campus. I don't think I've ever walked so much in my entire life. And the heat totally drains me by the end of the day. I am dead tired. I am really surprised by the comfort of the beds in my dorm room. At orientation I couldn't sleep at all because I was so uncomfortable but now the beds don't seem as bad. Except the window next to my bed shines light all night long. I am used to total darkness and total silence from home. The car noises and people at all hours makes it tough to fall asleep. I've also been having strange dreams lately. The first couple of weeks in a new place I always have really vivid dreams and I always remember them really clearly unlike usually. This happens everytime I am away from home. Wether it was when we moved to Singapore or just going to summer camp. I am looking at the picture of my dog sitting on my computer. I miss petting Lucy. The other day there was a towel laying on the floor of our dorm room and I had to do a double take because I thought it was Lucy laying there. She is too adorable. When I get my own place I am going to get a Labrador puppy. I don't think I could ever live totally by myself, without a pet or anything. I either need a roommate or an animal, something to acknowledge my existence with a tangible response. Now its been a little over twenty minutes and the pizza is here and it smells really good. "
Tell me about yourself.,"At this very moment I am feeling slightly depressed. My roommate left for the weekend to go home and see her grandmother. That's great. The first weekend of school and she decides to go home. She left me all alone even for the first football game. It's not that I am totally stuck on my roommate but having her around is nice. It gives me someone to go and do things with and just some extra company. I'm also a little stressed. Moving to college has been fine for me. I haven't gotten home sick, really. And I'm having a lot of fun. But adjusting to how much work I have now is hard. I one of those people who needs to complete all tasks and be ahead of schedule if possible. That's impossible here. And if your not computer literate your screwd. So that means that I am screwed. But on the same notion, it forces me to learn about computers and how they work. I have no option if I want to succeed. Succeeding is important. I was valedictorian of my high school. I think that is a curse. It seems that the past valedictorians have failed at what they have attempted past high school. And it doesn't help that the entire community is watching either. I want to succeed and prove that theory wrong. I hope it happens. I really miss my boyfriend. that is an interesting story. He is 26 and lives in Dallas. What a bummer. Not that he is 26 but that he lives in Dallas. It is hard with our relationship sometimes because we come for two totally different worlds. Most of the time I don't know how to read him. What is he thinking?  That worries me most of the time. I don't want to seem totally dependent or ignorant or niave. We once got into a fight and he told me that I had become to dependent on him. That really pissed me off. I don't believe that I had become dependent so much as emotionally attached and bored. Bored because he had moved and I had nothing else going on at the time. How dare he call me dependent. How am I suppose to feel when he decideds to move off to Dallas and not visit that much using his job as an excuse. Dependent my ass!  It just really irritates me. But I don't know what to think about it. Moments like these, when I'm all alone is when I miss him the most. And I try not to think about him scared that it is making me dependent but at the same time I can't help it. then I have thoughts go through my head that maybe being dependent every now and then isint so bad. Its him that has the problem. Why does he have to be so independent?  I don't believe that someone can be totally independent. Everyone from one time to another needs someone. Everyone. So why does he have to act as if he doesn't. I wonder if my time is up yet. I honestly don't think that this has helped me much. Its just made me think more. Great. yes my time is up. good. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now I am feeling very annoyed. I have to do my first lab write up and I am so confused. I wish I could get it all done now so that this holiday weekend I wouldn't have to worry about it. I am going home this weekend for the first time in a month or so. Even though I am a junior I have felt like such a freshmen this past week becuause I just transfered here. I don't think that's a bad thing , to feel like a freshmen, but it's really weird. I can't wait to go home. I got my parents and my brother a UT gift form the Co Op I can't believe that Jennifer is getting married this weekend. I think the wedding will be a lot of fun. I love the dress that I get to wear since I am a bridesmaid. I really though that if anyone was going to get married first it would be me. I am the one that hads the most stable realationship. i really hope taht their marriage works out. They haven't always gotten along really well. In fact when I first met her a year ago he was galavanting around town with some 5 other gulklirls. She is just that type of girl though to go for the ""jerk"" kind of guy. i really think that this was more of a pressure thing that they are doing this because since he went into the Air Force and then found out that he was going to Alaska I think he was scared to do it alone and he knew that he has always had her buy a string. I n all the time that I have known them they have never been really compasionate to each other and whats worse is that I used to hate him because of how he treated her and all the things I heard about him. well I wish the best for the two of them. I hope I don't forget anything for the wedding this weekend. I am still so nervous about this semester since I am in a new school. I think that I will be okay though because I know how to magage my time and use it wisely. It's dunny because there is always something to do. Tonight I made dinner for my boyfriend, my roomate and 2 of his roomates. That makes me feel good when I can do other things for people like that. We had spagetti salad french bread and I baked some cookies. I am feeling a t peace with myself right now becuase I now that I am doing all I can do to be the best. Not because I made dinner. But because I have gotten so much accomplished today int he way of school work and all the errands I had to run. It is so nice to sit here in this quiet apartment by myself and write for 20 min. I feel bad because I din't work out today. I have been doing really well though by going at least 3-4 times a week and running 2-3 miles a day and then doing weights. For some reason though I feel really fat. When I think about what I ate at dinner I want to gag. Oh my gosh I just thought about my Gov class and how boring it is. It was funny though becuase he was telling us that one student said that it was so boring it made him want to gounge his eyes out with a spoon. That;s hilarious becuase thats kind of how I felt today. The cool thing is that he published his lecture notes and I think they will help out a lot. He is also going to give out the test that he used in the summer for us to study. I don't think I have had a prof with worse organizationl skills. I was trying to take notes and it was so hard becuase he jumps around so much. you got to feel sorry for the guy though. At least he knows that he is not the most interesting guy. He also told us thata student told him that he talked like Norm Mcdoland. Very monotone. That was funny. The more and more I think about it it is true. Geez I can't believe I still have to do that long lab report that is going to take me forever and my TA has still not emailed me beck. At least for the first one she is going to grade them and then return them so we can correct it. That's really cool of her   "
Tell me about yourself.,"Today has been a good day. At first I was afraid that UT was going to be a difficult experience for me since I had never been far away from home for more than one week, but it has turned out well. I've met a lot of people. Last night, I had a really good time. Even though I was out really late it was an enjoyable experience. I have tried to maintain friendships with people from my small town of Laredo. Although many of them weren't close friends they are still a contact to a world so different from the world that I used to live in. Nonetheless, I don't think I want to live in the past. I want to live life to the fullest. In fact, I decided a few days ago that the only way to adjust and have fun, I have to remember that I am a naturally outgoing person even though shyness sometimes overcomes me. Due to this, I have met more people. I do hope that the people I have met so far aren't psycho, though. You never know who you are talking to in a town this size or what that person must be thinking. Last night I had to ask some random person for a ride because the dorm dorms were locked and there was no one there to answer. Under any normal circumstances I would not have done such an irresponsible and dangerous acts but I was scared and I didn't want to spend the night in the lobby. As a result, I see that UT and Austin are turning me into a new person that I always wanted to be. Uninhibited. Fun. Wild. Although these characteristics have always been in me I realize now that they are barely rearing their heads for a a new beginning of adventure and excitement.  I don't miss home as much as I thought I would. I see that freedom and self-rule has begun to change my personality (hopefully for the better). However, I can't help but think that it may all be wrong. What if home is what kept me safe and secure. Being away from my boyfriend is the hardest. It has been two weeks since I last saw him and already doubts have sprung into my mind. I think of him and don't miss him the way I thought I would. I do in a way but not as badly as expected. A friend told me to keep her posted on my feelings and what I was thinking but I feel that talking about my lack of feelings would be almost as bad as being unfaithful to him. Nontheless, UT is proving to be a different and definitely exciting experience that I hope to enjoy for many more years. The future lies ahead and I await it with an anxiousness I have never known. I hope it all works out in the end. "
Tell me about yourself.,"College is so cool. This is a pretty cool campus. Surprisingly I'm really not that scared or homesick, and I'm 1400 miles away from home. I grew up in Dallas, TX. , but I moved to Minnesota when I was 11 and then to Wisconsin when I was 15. Now I'm back in good ol' Texas to stay. I have quite a few friends here so it's not like I'm alone. In fact, I saw my old elementary ""girlfriend"" the other day down on the drag. I was walking to get my books and she was in a 99 black ford mustang driving the other way. She honked the horn and waved and as I looked back to wave at her, I tripped on a pole and nearly fell flat on my face. I don't know if she saw it. i hope not. I called her up tonight to talk to her, but she wasn't home so I left a message. I said, ""it was cool seeing you the other day, but I don't know if you saw me almost fall flat on my face, it was embarrasing. I can't go out looking like that so give me a call so I can reedem myself. ""  I can't believe that the jester tv channel shows cool movies. My roomate is watching the movie Fallen right now with this girl. He says its really scary, but I just think it's weird. It's funny, I never really get scared that much by movies and stuff. I think I just tell myself that it's not real and then it doesn't bother me. That must be like psychology or something. Damn, I think about the opposite sex way too much. I love girls, I think that they are the most beautiful creatures to ever walk the face of the earth. I certainly picked the right campus for girls though. Like 70% of them are goddesses compared to the ones where I come from. Where I live now, most of the girls are big farm girls that could take me in a fair fight, and they are all polish. Polish people are so stupid . . they'd couldn't make ice because they forgot the receipe. Well, my twenty minutes are up, so this is me signing off "
Tell me about yourself.,"Today has been a very stress ful day starting with the first time I ever missed a class. Today my parents and I got in a fight and I was going to be late to class so  I decided to just not go. This caused my parents to be evenmore upset with me. Not to mention that we were already stressed about the apartment situation for next year. Isn't that retared to hav eto sign a lease in September for the following school year? You don't even know if you will get along with the people that you ahve agreed to live with for the entire year. A realty company makes everything so much more difficult. We have to pay a application fee and a security depsoit of $35 adn $480 respectivly. In the upcoming week we have to put our firsty monts rent down which is $481. It is just rediculous that we have to worry about this at this point in time. I am also extremly stressed about school. First of all I don't know what to expect coming from hogh school to college. Second of all, all the professors throw all this stuff at you st once and expect you to remeber itall. It is completly over whelming to a freshman. Third on my list, my soroity is also giving us all these dates to remember, things to sign up for, dues to pay, committments to fulfill that everything is all mumble jumble in my head. I am completely overwhelmded. Foutrh of all, I never get any sleep. I had to go home to Houston to get rest and to be able to study. Fifth -- I have not been able to fit my routine work out into my schedule yet. I am terrified about gaining the freshman fifteen. This summer I wroked so hard to lose weight, and I finally did. I will be greatly depressed if I gain it back and more!!!!  College is supposed to be the best four years of your life, but so far it has been one big stress pile up. I can;t take it. Not to mention that I am completwly homesick. I am so close to my family it is ridiculous. I miss my mom to no extent. My sister just got engaged and I feel like I am missing out on all of the party plans. I feel so far away. My dad has to be the most unselfish wise person I know. He adds so much to a converation. I miass them all so much. Everyhting brings me to tears these days if I start to think too long about it. One of the most important things in my life I forgot. My dog Jake. I miss his sweet face so much. He was such a good friend and companion. I never have any time to email my friends in London or in other colleges around the nation. I also feel like I am having a hard time opening up to my surrounding s whether it is to my girlfriends or to guys. I wish everything wasn't ALWAYS a drunken brawl. I don't mind the partying if it only were in moderation. Anyways, I think I am just having to get adjusted and that it is just taking me longer than others. everything is all so important to me:grades friends, guys, family, beliefs etc. Why can't evrything just be perfect???? "
Tell me about yourself.,"Writing about what I am thinking will be a new experience for me. I just got back from psychology class, so naturally I am thinking about psychology. The way I learn is that I review everything said in class in my mind for at least 30 minutes after class. Now that I am doing the writing assignment I have other things to think about. my roommate is cleaning out the refrigerator. I honestly think that she is one of the most histerical persons in the world. my other two roomates are engrosed in the television which basically means that they are compeletely useless for the next four hours (unresponsive to almost anything excep for maybe a fire in the house) maybe they will talk to my roommate that is cleaning out the frig. during a comercial. Kate, the one cleaning out the frigerator just called the two couch potatoes re and tard, that made me laugh. Trying to keep one line of thought is really hard for me. I listen to everything that goes on around me and have to have a thought about it. It makes it really dificult for me to study most of the time. I cannot study at home because I have to talk to all my roommates or listen to them being crazy or something normal (that does not happen very often around here though)  I also cannot study at libraries because I am a people watcher. I like to just sit and watch people. I learn a lot about people that I don't even know just by watching them interact with their friends, or even how they walk. I also suffer from severe migranes, which makes my life interesting when I get a really bad one. I think I have almost overcome them, but I do have one right now. all I have to say about it is AGHHHHHHHH. My mind almost automatically switches to thinking about Alexander when I have nothing else to think about. he is my best friend and I love hanging around him. he just broke up with his girlfirend and I just broke up with my boyfriend so we have a lot of crying to do around each other. my exboyfriend was really bad for me. it took me two and a half years to be able to say that outloud. I think the only reason that I went out with him, and stayed with him was because he was the first guy to acknowledge my existence. I guess I didn't have very much self esteme when I met him, but now I do, and now I realize how bad he was for me. Alright, it think that my 20 minutes are almost up, so I am going to go eat something and get ready for water polo practice. adios. "
Tell me about yourself.,what am I thinking about don't got the foggest clue. looking to see how long I have to write for and what I am going to write about. thinking about a wonderful girl that I wish to be close to just wondering if she wants the smae or if I want to see other people. I do miss having my sister in the same city as me she really has meant a lot to me in the past few years and I do wish she was here. but then again I am loving all of my freedom here. have not talked to my mom in a few days and I like it she is not hounding me to do anything. niether is my grandmother. wonder why kellys dad wanted to talk to me. do miss kelly a little but hopefully we can still be friends  wonder what nicole is doing right now. this is the third time I tried to write but the other tow trys I go restless and stop writing. really did not know what to say but now I am just hoping it is not to late for these writing assignments. always seem to wait till the last minute. I cna hear thoughts in my mind but don't know how to put them into words. or which one should I write about first. lunch was good and now I am feeling better because I got something to eat. don't want to work anymmore at eddie bauer because I don't like it anymore and I don't want to work there because I may have something better to do and plus I hope I can find someone to work for me tomarrow so I can go to the training session to be an offical for intermural football. hope my family is doing ok have not heard from them lately. still have ten minutes to write. my mind is completly blank I keep thinking about this book we read last year in english it was written in stream of thought. hope the professer got my email about the brain test to see if a person is right or left brained. nose itches. relly wish we did not have to do this. or at least not for so long. ok sitting like this is not the easiet  ok that is better. morrre comfortable. hope miriam can go this weekend to george carlin have not talked to her in a week and hope everything is going good with her. my neighbors are wierd they play some stange fucked up music. hope I do good on my quiz tommarow I need to study and catch up on my readings. need to know when my calculus test is. and my eco. test. hope the pysc test is not soon. really need to catch up on some reading. hope nicold can everything taken care of so she is not so stressed out.

Tell me about yourself.,"The Complete Works of Shakespere is a very large book and although I've skimmed  through King Lear and Hamlet and a little bit of the old Twelfth Night, I reckon  it would take me about a year and a half reading every day to get through that  whole book. I'm glad I could change my schedule during add/drop because getting  up at eight just would have not happened at all. Sexie Sady, she lastest and  the greatest of them all. did you know the world was waiting just for you oo ooo  Sexie Sady or Sadie, however big you think you are areaeaereare. You'll get  yours yet. Abby's massage to the alternative take to this song. All those  weird little encounters. This assignment better be like confidential. A man's  thoughts word for word over twenty minutes by definition should be filled with  nasty gutter talk and such, but for the sake of the grader, this stream of  continuous mental blabber shall be filtered convieniently for filthynesses sake. Helter Skelter would you want me to make you? Tell me tell me tell me the answer  Helter Skelter Helter Skelter Helter Skelter ooooooo!  Aw here she come! Nice  slide guitar work ther, George, when I get to the botom I go back to the top of  the slide Do you don't you want me to make you? Comin dowm fast but don't let me  break you.

Noise, and back into the song once more. once more. Hahahaha. Next  cut, fellows. It's not necessary to go on for say fifteen minutes. Now a nice  quiet one. No one will ever read this. Time to change the announcement on my  answering machine. I'll have my computer do it again, but in a differnt voice  than that man voice named Bill or whatever. I must go Junda Hu's office hours  today and hand in me homework, lest I be penalized. Where is RLM?  Where will I  go after that. Will I take a shower. Yes. Will I wear my pledge pin or on the  same plane, will I wear a collard shirt around campus this afternoon. I've had  a pleasant and not so well deserved morning lounging around the room while my  good buddy went off to an 8oclock class this morning. Too bad for him, although  I probably should have ittited off to Junda Hu's. We go over stuff that I know  too well already, but the homework definately should have been put up then. After Pledge Line I probably will not make class in the morning Friday, but I  know that I really should go. That would be a very terrible habit to fall into  although I know many upperclassmen that not only do not go to class on a whim,  but sell back half their newly bought books Like Brent right at the beginning of  the semester just for full retail reimbursement and on hopes to just wing it all  from the course packets and what not. I'ts funny when people in conversation  use ""and whatnot. "" It really says a lot about tha speaka and grabs the  attention of the listener because that little turn of the tongue is not too  oftern used any more. THe directions said not to pay attention to sentence  structure and such a dn that is good because right now I am mayor of run-on  city. I suppose those who waste the time to right all this down on paper first  and transcribe their stuff will pretty it up a bit and the experiment will be  botched like that. enough. I used to do this kind of stuff in 6th grade En "

THIS IS SO BORING. I DON'T REALLY WANT TO SAY ANYTHING THAT SOMEONE ELSE MIGHT READ. THEY SAID THIS WASN'T GOING TO BE GRADED SO IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU SAY BUT I DON'T THINK THEY WOULD MAKE YOU WRITE IT IF THEY WEREN'T GOING TO LOOK AT IT.

I believe ti to be true. I can see how most of us would get depressed. the whole new environment. new friends. keeping up with old friends. worrying about how to fit in. about grades, and gpa's and food and getting the freshman fifteen. find a family church. keeping strong in faith and healthy relationships. and to add to that everyone's else's problems. hm. that was a good kiss. I love gary. I feel so blessed with to have him. he is such a selfless and caring and giving guy! I'm glad he got back safely. I wish the ppl in the halls would be quiet. that's what I hate aobut college and ddorm life. there's always SOMEONE in your room or in your hall talking. and I can' t hget started on homesork anymore until like 9:00pm and by the time I finish I get reallly tired causeit's really late. and I wonder why I go to sleep so late. I waste all my time. I went shopping with lucy and josephine yesterday. at momoko. the CUTEST little store . I like my hello kitty towel. it's so cute and the the bracelet. except I wish it wasn't pink. blue's cuter. and yeah. hmmmmm. that other store the chadeau was really nice.

I hate karen. but I'm not supposed to. but why oh why is she the way she is? how insensitive!  and how int he world did she and jennifer becom best friends all of a sudden. what an act, I swear. it's all an act. they look so happy when they go arouund hating the world together. I don't know if jennifer is fake around me, either. it's so hard to tell. and I don't like the way she is with gary. I don't like it. I hate it, I hate it. why the fake smile and the fake happy attitude. how fake. and the high pitched voice. and karen. ohhhhhhhhhhhhh. what the heck? she's ugly and she's fat and she's got big buggy eyes and she thinks she's all that . she's all FAKE.

Tell me about yourself.,"why did these girls from my hometown just call me and invite my roomate and I to a frat party? what were they thinking? these silly girls went to school with me for 4 years, and all of a sudden I have changed into a college girl that wants to drink, party, and hang out with jocks?? uhhh, I don't think so. I mean, it is a nice gesture, I guess. I would almost rather they not call at all. that would make me feel so much better, I hate seeing all of those kingwood people in austin. I eamn, I did come here to expand my horizons. I do not think that frat parties are neccessary to experience what college is all about. So, I decided to stay at home and work on psychology homework. Why? it isn't like I am enjoying this. I would much rather be out watching a band, or listening to music, or hanging out with my best friend holly. I really like the fact that we are roomates now. over the summer and for about the last year or so, we didn't get to hang out very much. But, now that we are here, it is like we are getting to know each other all over again, and I love that. Even though we are extremely different now, she is like part of my family and makes this huge campus seem somewhat small and unintimidating. She is also a lot like me, like when those girls called, I could tell by her facial expressions that it was a ridiculous idea. It was almost as though I could read her mind. My foot itches. Tomroow, I am going to church for the first time in about 6 months. I don't know why I stopped going, maybe I got too pessimistic or maybe my spiritual side just died with the loss of some important friends. I am not really sure, but I am certainly hoping to revive that side of me, because I definately need some sort of outlet for all of this stress and lonliness. No, that is not the right word, I am not lonely, maybe just scared of what I am to become being spiritually dark. Why did that happen? I don't understand so many things, but I am trying. I have also been going with Holly, my best friend, to her church related organization on campus. I really like it a lot, maybe things will change soon. I miss my mom. I hope that she is ok without me, and my little brother too. He is in second grade and doing so well, but he hates school. He isn't very attentive, but very creative. I miss my family, we were very close. Except for my dad, he is a jerk. I wonder sometimes if I will ever find it important to speak to him again. I don't really think so. He does nothing but cause stress and harm, he doesn't pay attention unless it is something bad. He doesn't know me, yet he seems to evaluate my every BAD move, without noticing the good ones. I am not a girl that holds onto grudges, but I am too pessimisstic right now to forgive him. Maybe it will come in time. I hope that I am not studying the wrong things for class. I often wonder how I am going to make the grades. I mean, I know I can, I am very smart, but it is hard to concentrate right now with all of these things happening at once. Especially coming to college for the first time. I never dreamed that it would be as draining as it is. Once again, I am so glad to have Holly here to keep me in my comfort zone. It is said that you make some life-long friendships here, but I am struggling with all of these new people. I have not found the time to REALLY get to know anyone that is new yet. It is like they are all aquaintences. I am sure that that will all change, once I am in the swing of things and I do not refer to old friendships as a comparison. Why are we doing this assignment? Am I part of some sort of research? I would like to know, I feel like I am spilling all of these things onto paper, maybe someone will read them and take them into account, maybe not. Maybe I am just another research rat. Why do they always do research on rats? I don't get it? If you are going to hurt an animal, why is it always rats? I mean, isn't there something that is closer to humans genetically than rats? maybe monkeys. But I do not like that animal research idea at all. Give it up. We are human, we are not supposed to understand everything that walks, breathes, and thinks. We should just contemplate it, talk to people, and think about them to ourselves. Why should we impose onto other species? What if it was the other way around? Wouldn't we think. ""Why do they even care? It isn't as if they can change anything, even if they wanted to?"" People are people, it is instinct, why should we cut it apart. It almost ruins the whole experience of life on Earth. or mars for that matter. Do we care if there is life on Mars? Unless we interact with them in some way, why should we care? Technology is killing man, man is killing himself. Life is supposed to be fun and exciting. not facts, computers, and stress about the y2k crap. Oh well, I don't understand. Why am I thinking all of this at one time? Pretty weird how it all just sort of comes to my fingers as I am typing, but I suppose I am thinking it for a reason. I got a package today, it was a necklace from a friend in houston. it was nice but he said taht when he saw it it made him think of me. Why? I asked myself did that necklace make him think of me? it really isn't anything like my fashion. and there was no letter inside, only a necklace. I mean, it is the thought that counts, but that is ridiculous. I think I deserve more credit for my individuality than that. hahaha. ok, I am really hoping that some good shows come around here in austin. I miss the punk rock scene in houston. I am sure I just need to get to know people who like it and just start going. I found a club that I am really into now, it is called the concert comittee of the texas council. I am extremely excited about that. I wonder if I am going to dream about any of thise weird stuff tonight. I wonder if it will stay inside my head and dwell there until my eyelids close. Then, all of the thoughts will explode and I will have one huge lng dream about my dad, holly, church, monkeys, rats, and music. that would be weird huh? I definately think so. Well, my back is definately starting to hurt from sitting in this stupid dorm chair for so long. I want a back rub. ad you are probably wondering why my assignment is long. I can type extremely fast for some weird reason. I am done. enjoy me *cara* "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am really tired today. I am also pretty homesick. It is my birthday. I wish that I was at home. I want to celebrate my birthday with my parents and sister. I want to go to my favorite restaurants. Blue Goose sounds really good, but why am I worried about good restaurants in Dallas. I can get just as good or better food here in Austin. I want a turkey sub for dinner tonight. I also want to go to get ice cream from Aimee's with my friends, but I have so much to do. I have to review all of my notes tonight for my classes, plus I have to go to the sorority pledge class meeting at sometime. I better look up the time soon. I am glad I stayed in and studied this weekend. It helped me get organized and feel like I knew what I was doing. Rush really made me crazy. I hope I like being in a sorority. I am scared because I don't party that much, and I don't want it to take away too much time from my studies. I know that I do have to balance my life. I have to make time to meet people nad have fun. I just never feel like I have enough time to do everything. I feel bad that I couldn't go to lunch with Leisha today because I had to read my phylosophy, but I went to run and then to church this morning and I had to get my stuff done this afternoon to be ready for the meeting tonight. I wish that I was at home and could just relax and watch TV. I miss summer time when I didn't have to do too much. I hope all of my friends in all of their colleges are doing well. The birthday card from Amy made me sad. It already feels like we are drifting apart from each other. Even when I e-mail her, I don't know what to say. I feel like she doesn't care what is going on here because she doesn't know all of people I am talking about when I tell her what I am doing. Why doesn't she tell me a lot about her life?  I want to know what is going on, not just hi how's it going kind of stuff. I am so happy I know my roommate though. We have had so much fun together, and we keep each other sane. I get scared when I think what might have been if I had gone pot luck. I keep meeting people who have crazy roommates, but I think I really could have gotten a long with everyone. I have met the coolest people. That girl I sat next to in Economics the other day, was really neat. I need to get her number. I like my sailor sis in Delta Gamma, but I am afraid to go out with her. I don't know if I can keep up with all of these UT people. They party way more than I do. I think I am going to go home this Labor day weekend because the parties aren't a necessity to meet people. Anyways, nobody who I talk to will remember me because they are all drunk. I don't understand why I go to these paries to  meet people when I can't even have a coherent conversation with people, but I guess they are fun. I am so confused right now, but I think it will all start working out soon. I just wish that I knew everybody instantly and did not have to work so hard at meeting people. In high school I could see anyone and know them. Like at the game last night, I hardly knew anyone, and in high school I could talk to anyone around me. I guess soon enough, I will make new and good friends, but I sure hope it comes soon. Luckily, I have Megan. She has kept me from being sad, plus I really like it in Austin. I love walking around campus and seeing everyone. It is the prettiest campus, and I really like all of my classes. I am really scared about keeping my grade point up. I worked hard in high school and did well, but will it be enough for college?  I sure hope so. I know my parents will be happy as long as I do my best, but sometimes I feel that is not enough. I guess I pressure myself too hard. I just have to keep listening to my parents advice to balance my time between relaxing, socializing, and studying. I will do my best. I know that it will all start being normal to me pretty soon. I just have to wait for the adjusting period to be over. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now I am feeling very tired. I have a nervous feeling in my stomach probably because I am going to meet a guy that I've had a crush on this friday. I am kind of upset that my friend from chicago hasn't called me. I am also nervous about the semester, because I am hoping to bring up my GPA since I didn't do so well, last year. My second year and already I feel like my classes  are just going to give me a lot of trouble. I'm still on basics and at times I feel dumb because I should already be in my upper division courses. I am motivated again to do well and I feel that everything I am doing so far is going to get me to where I want to be. I have exercised, studied, relaxed, etc. What else do I need to achieve my goal. I want to get into med-school and become a doctor. But, I also want to finish as soon as possible. I miss my family, but I don't miss the rules that they give me. My parents are good parents, don't get me wrong, but I still disagree with a lot of the rules. I guess everyone raises their kids differently. But in a way they have me scared. Scared, to go out to clubs with my friends, or parties or any other social activity that happens at night. Mainly because they would always tell me that it wasn't me they didn't trust it  was the ""people out there""  So, that freaks me out and whenever I do go to clubs or anything I'm always paranoid that someone is going to have a gun and just start shooting. Or an even worse thought is that I might somehow get hit by a drunk driver. Whatever happens in the world that makes the news and freaks out my parents is what I'm afraid of. Maybe, that's how they wanted it. I'm still a pleasant person to hang out with, don't get me wrong, but sometimes I just worry too much. Back to the feeling tired bit, well this past weekend I went home for my sisters birthday. It was a surprise. She gave me a big hug. And it made me feel really good, because me and my sister are always fighting. And going away to college has brought us closer. She is 15 and I'm 19 so it's a big age difference. Anyway I went to her party that my parents had for her and I slept about 5 hrs. the entire weekend. I got home Monday morning and slept all day. And about being nervous well, sometimes I always have that feeling. And usually I can explain it, but there are times when I don't know why. I like this guy James from Chicago, the one who hasn't  called. And since I've met him, I can't seem to stop talking about him. I catch myself talking about him as though he's made a big impact on my life. And really he hasn't. So far everyone I've met has heard about him and my roommates are tired of it. But I can't help it, so lately for everyone's sake I've been keeping quiet and trying to talk about other things, but I still have him on my mind. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I don't like the fact that I'm not sure if I can print stuff in this library. it would be so much more easy if I had my own computer, but oh well sarah is probably getting one in a few days then I can use hers it is so crazy how much things have become computer dependent I never thought that I would have a class that was web-based. but it seems that most of mine are and its kinda good in a way because it is forcing me to actually use the technology thats out there I'm not very computer oriented but I think about one year of college will whip me into shape, speaking of I need to go to the gym, but I'm not sure that ill make it tonight maybe ill call jane and see if she has time to go wiht me. sarah doesn't really work out a lot so I've been doing it by myself it would be a good idea to get one of thoes little hand held recorders and tape my spanish lectures because he lectures entirely in spanish and I understand spanish stuff so much better the second time through that I think it would be a really good idea to tape him and then listen to it while I work out wow its only been five minutes its hard to do stuff like this when you know that tons of homework awaits you and you arent really looking forward to it. I'm so glad we have monday off A&M doesn't' even have this holiday but I guess that they started later than we did. I'm going there this weekend and I can't wait to see my closest friends in all the world because they all went there I'm glad I didnt even though I miss them dearly because I have been forced to meet all kinds of new people and I have met some really nice ones, not as great as my best freinds but then again its only been two weeks they all seem to be sticking together pretty much which I think I s pretty dumb because they are never going to grow up if they don't start spreading there wings so to speak. its kinda funny that I just happened to look at my watch and I have been writing for ten minutes now I always seem to look at it in 5-10-15 minute increments. maybe myu internal clock is really acurate or something. I dunno. I'm really tired right now even though I got a lot of sleep the other night maybe I just need even more. I need more sleep thatn anyone I know I wonder if I get more tired because I convince myself I didnt get enough sleep or if I'm actually really tired. I think I do get really tired becuase it starts to show on my face, I get horrible bags under my eyes and I just look gross. like right now. plus I am totally broken out, more than I have ever been, but I'm hoping that its just the stress from going off to colegio. who knows well see in about a week. why is it that sometimes your face turns red. I hate that so much I feel so exposed when that happens. I can feel it getting hotter and I think that makes me even more self concious which in turn makes mya face even more red. I wonder if people you don't know notice when you blush or is it not as obvious as it seems. i didnt used to blush but now I occasionally do a t really inopportune times . like today when a guy I think is attractive said hi to me I got all flustered. its so stupid I don't even know him and I've convinced myself that we are destined to be together. sometimes I am so unrealistic when it comes to relationships correction I am always unrealistic that is something hard for me to admit to because in admitting that I feel let down. I get really dejected when it comes to guys, and I don't theink that any good ones exist even though I know in theory that isn't true I just havent come accross anyone who has disproved it to me. maybe its because I don't attract the nice guys because I'm sending off a negative vibe that was on oprah the other day. they were saying how can you attract someone if you automatically have a bad attitude about it and think that they couldnt possibly be worhty of you. I dunno. I can't stop thinking all guys are bad just to attract a guy because I think that is the wrong motive for changing my opinion. its like in bridget jones diary she does stuff like that sometimes I remind myself of her except not as extreme. well of course not she was a complete lunatic. I wish my parents were not in ireland right now becasue I would looooovvvveeee to see them this weekend but I can wait I miss them so much I think because we get along so incredibly well its really abnormal I think no one else I know gets along as well with there parents as I do its really cool I thinkwow I went over the 20 minutes who would have guessed thats kinda weird everytime I mentioned the time I said wow. huh "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well what do I want to say I guess I should start by being pissed off that the girl I'm dating didn't call me last night after she said she would. we aren't committed or anything it just aggravates me when someone goes back on their word. well my brother's in town for the first time to see me we went to a good party last night, actually it was totally lame and it sucked that it was his first u. t. party. tonight will be so much better though cause the party tonight will be cool. phi Kappa Psi is where it's at. right now notre dame is barely beating purdue even though it's a two point game n. d. should run away. college has been cool so far and I like the fact that I automatically get credit for this assignment by just writing my thought down. that's pretty cool. my hardest class is my calculus class it's totally reeming me. i've never had a tutor before but he's my new best friend now. damn it's hot in here. the cafeteria should open right about now. i hope they have good food today lately they've be lacking the good food department. my roomate just doesn't understand. I really do believe he and I are do a good fist fight before it's all over. actually it won't be a good fight because I'll kill him. he's so loud and thinks that just because we're roommates we're automatically buddies for life. i think we could be friends maybe even good friends if he could. we'll how I don't know cause he gets on my nerves so much. oh well we're two different people from two different background. kid rock is awesome. especially on the mtv video awards. it's really hard to writes and sing at the same time. but I guess I can do that considering the fact that there aren't any wrong answers and I can write anything. i don't really miss home that much. maybe my family a little but austin is so cool. i just hope I can keep my grades up so I can stay in the fraternity. and I hope I have enough money to pay for all the dues. well my  time is almost up and I hungry as can be so I guess I'll go now. ? "
Tell me about yourself.,"well, write now I guess there are a lot of things going through my head, but it's hard for me to put them into words I guess. well I had fun last nite. i went to a party witha bunvh of friends. a lot of people were drinking, but iwas one of the few that wasn't drinking. it seemed like everyonw who was drinking had fun, but I had fun, even though I didnt drink. i had fun just dancing an d meeting people. i met a lot of guys, which wus good. since I usually am kinda shy bout meeting peopple. anywyas. i'm really tired right now, because we only went to sleep around 6, even though we came home around 430, and I had to get up at 11 because a friend from out of town styed over, so I had to help them pack and get ready to leave and stuff. gosh, I lkie so many guys right now, but I think that my other friends like the sme guys that I like, or at least they think he's cute too, but I don't know what to do aobut it. oh well, I guess I'll jus have to figure somthing out. man, I have a lot of homework to do today. actually I need ot catch up on my reading. i have a lot of reading to do in this class, then I have chem homework and calculus homework. i'm so lost in my chem class. well, not lost, but I wish I knew someone else in that class, so I could at leasst have someone to do homework with or jus to call if I had any questions, buti  guess I should just start meeting people in there, or someting, because I really need to find a study buddy in there. I think that's my only class that I don't know anyone in. i have friends in my language class, and in my calculus class and in my psych class. i just don't kno anyone in my chem class. but hopefully that will change soon. oh today either my roomate's dad or my dad called today, but this guy that was in our room picked up the phone, and our partents are really strict about guys, so I hope I don't get in trouble. the guy who picked up the phone covered it up pretty well, but then we expected our parntets to call again, but no one ever called, so I kinda got worried, that they would think that we have guys in our room. oh well, I think I may be getting worried over nothinh. because they probably wont even say anyting, or even know. oh well. oh, I have a minute left in my writing assigment, so I guess that's it "
Tell me about yourself.,"right now it is 7:30 and I am suppose to write for twenty minutes. this shouldn't be hard, so ill just write exactly what comes to my mind. I'm sitting in one of the guys on my halls room. so I may make some references to what he is saying. Today was a very tiring day. i went to bed at nine last night and couldnt get up. i think I just over slept. I was excited to see my best friend for dinner tonight. he can always make me laugh and put a smile on my face. i need to get my hair cut when I go home this weekend. and I need to go shopping for my brother before I get home. its his birthday on sat. i am not sure what I need to get him. hes so easy to shop for but I want to get him something he will really like. My dad and my brother came in this weekend and I was so happy to see them. i only wish I knew if he were saved. i gave him a card last week in the mail asking him if he was because I wanted to know if he would be with me in heaven when all is said and done. and he still hasn't responded to the card. i hope I didnt scare him or make him feel uncomfortable. i just wish he would understand how awesome God is. he has done so much for me. and I just wish my dad would let God bless him as well. all I know is that without God. i would not make it through every day. I'm really blessed that the people I hang out with are strong Christians. i just hope that I am a strong influence on those who don't know Christ. I'm really glad I get to see my mom and sister this weekend . i miss them so much. I need to start managing my time better soon. or I am going to be far behind in my classes. i also need to start running again. its been about four days since I last ran. not good. I have no idea what to write next. but give me a minute and something will come to mind. i hope I'm thinking but what I'm writing is all I am thinking about. ok this past weekend some of my friends came up and it was good to see them. except one girl used two towels while she was here. i could of shot her. she doesn't understand that I am in college and as stupid as it sounds I don't have towels coming out my ears. and I have to wash them. and it cost money to wash living in the dorm. which I love there is always something to do here. its so much fun. there is never a dull moment. i only get annoyed when some girls down the hall yell and scream like they are haveing the time of their life all the time. it really starts to bug. i don't know I'm listing to this guy whose room I'm in talk on the phone so that is what is in my mind now. i can't wait tomorrow I start impulse. a freshman bible study on campus. i hope to meet some more life long friends there. iv really enjoyed this class so far. its fun and interesting. i have two minutes left to write. this really wasnt a hard assignment. it was easier than I thought. and kind of neat. i guess its almost time for me to start the next one. just a few more seconds and I'm done. ok anytime now. a minute seems a lot longer when you think it should be over. ok its over. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am thinking right now, at this momest what Cullen is thinking. does he like me??  I wonder. I wonder if I am too short. I wonder if I am too fat. I wonder if my mom is Ok. she is always worrying about me and she thinks so highly of me. I don't want to let her down. My dad works so hard for the entire family. I sometimes think he looks so sad. I hope he isn't sad because o love him more than anything. I wonder if I will find true love?  Someone just like my father. A strong, hardwroking, Loving man who would do anything for his wife and kids. I am very annoyed right now at the sound of the vaccum. I feel sorry for the woman who is vaccuming. I hope she can not read this as she is standing behind me. I am very excited about the party tonight. I hope I can balance work play. I think I will be able to. I have never had a problem before. All the girls here are very nice. I was really scared to come here because I thought all girls that went here were snobs. But they are nice. I have matured greatly since I have been here. I can't believe I have a cclass at 3:30. That is such a nightmare. I would rather just get them all over with at once. I hope I picked the right sorority. I am glad I am not in Kappa with Katie. but then I wonder if I should be a Kappa. I think I just look more like a kappa then a theta. Oh well. I will be happy. Our pledge class is awesome. I am so excited about this scrapbbok we have to  make. It is so fun. I love being like a martha stewart. Is it bad that I just want to go to school to find a husband and j\have my 5 kids????  I hope I really don't have to work. It scares me. Everything was perfect before I left. now everything scares me because I am facing reality. I am living with a person I don't even know - to go to school here. I hope the future brings awesome things for me. I am worried because everyone says that there is a time in your life that will be grief. I have had the best life so far. I am scared that one day it will just hit m - poof - and I will just want to die. I hope my mom or my dad or my brothers don't die soon. I love them too much. I never show them that I do though. I probably have the worst relationship with my motehr, ever. we barely speak. I just go to her if I want money. I think that that is because she sees me as the most perfect creation, ever. so she never has yelled at me, or scolded me. but she yells at my brothers all the time. That is so unfair to them. I should not be treated better. My brothers are all dyslexic, including me, but that is not my e\excuse. It is my brothers excuse for everthing. My mom is always doing Luke's papers or assignments for him. That is so wrong. I work hard and study more because I am dyslexic. I deal with it. My brothers see it as a means to get out of doing work. The assume they are dumb, so they don't even try. they are satisfied with being dumb. That should not be the case. I really miss Bridget. she is my very best friend. I also miss Katey. my two best friends at tech. I think it is great how I did not follow them. I am a very dependent person, yet independent. I depend on my friends, yet I love to be alone to ponder and be by myself. Katey and Bridget are like my securities. Evn if I did notr have one friend here, I knew they, at leats bridget, will alwyas be there for me. I hope tonigth is fun. I feel really sorry for my suitemate. She tries so hard to meet boys but they just don't like her. She has had sex a lot. I am very pround of my virginity. I think it says a lot abput who I am and how important God and my morals are. I love the fact that I can just talk to God anytime - anywhere by myself. He knows all about me - and I know all about Him yet I have never seen him nor spoken to him. A true person is found in the dark. If you were to turn off all the lights everyone would probably like a totally different person they who they think they should like. It wouldn't matter is you were tall, small, fat, ugly, black or white, if the light were off. Only the insides of people would matter. Appearances say a lot aboiut people, but yet they don't. If a person was ugly, you probably wouldn't really care what they thought. Because we are all attrcated to people. Our frieds are people we think are attractive and so we only like people in which we think there is something pretty about them. well, my twenty minutes are up so I guess I have nothing more to say. "
Tell me about yourself.,"How strange is it to be sitting in a room, a strange room, in the dark without lights and two sleeping zombies around you. The only sounds I hear are the clicking noises coming from the keyboard, the humming sound of the computer, the air conditioning that sounds like running water from a nearby restroom and an occasional door slam now and then. I hope I am not making too much noise. I don't want to disturb the steady sleepers around me as they let me use their computer. I can't wait till my roomate's computer gets fixed or until my brother finally puts mine together. I wonder if my friend has arrived at Dobie and is coming up to find me in this room at this very minute. HOw much time has passed. Oh I still have four more minutes. I wonder what my boyfriend is doing this very minute? I think he is working. Should I go out with my friends tonight? No I'm going to stay home and read tonight. I miss my parents, the homecooked meals, and my boyfriend. I wonder if my friends miss me as much as I miss them? Life in Austin is pretty great, yet something seems to be missing in my life here. I think I'm still getting adjusted with this new style of life---no sleep, total independence, and the new surroundings and friendships, which are not the norms that I have been accustomed to all my years living in Houston. I had a routine in Houston, which can not exist here. "
Tell me about yourself.,there are many things going through my mind at the moment I wonder how everyone is back home my mom I miss her very much I wonder if my quiz tomorrow is going to be hard tomorrow man I miss melissa too my girlfriend for two years already man I hope it works out for us I love it here at ut but I feel bad because I miss everyone I wonder if that will pass or not I wonder how I am going home this weekend I hope its by bus mom wants me to rent a car to go home I'm not sure about that I might get lost man I miss them I wonder if my roomate likes me and the way I act sometimes I feel weird and other times we connect really well I wonder if I'm doing this right I don't want to miss up I didnt use any punctuation whatsoever man I hope I do well here that is my main concern man my fingers hurt a little just on my right hand though man I eat a lot today at dinner I think I'm gaining a lot of wieght I hope I can control it I feel like working out but I feel guilty leaving all my unfinished work here it just dosent feel right doing that but I feel so heavy and not so attractive right know I miss my pet kittens they were just born before I left I hope I do well here at ut I would feel bad if I didnt do well here its so intimitating here at a big school from a 2a school to a university of about 50000 or maybe more I don't exactly know for sure I wonder how long its been man I keep scrolling to the top to see if I'm doing this right I hope I am damn I love it here its just so peaceful here I think it is a lot of people but really nice I am glad I'm here I wonder what other homework I have man I want to do so well I just hope I do I need to its imparitive I do I just don't know what I would do I need to balance my schedule too man I have a lot to do tonight man wheres my girlfriend she was supposed to call me man I hope shes alright with me here and everything I know she loves me very much yeah I know she can't wait to see me this weekend I miss her a lot I can't wait to leave either I want to see everyone at home man I miss everyone I wonder who else is going to read this man these are my thoughts right know man I wonder its going to be on my mind all night I hope I can study man I want to go home so bad but I want to stay I don't know  
Tell me about yourself.,"I am an architecture major. Therefore I do not sleep. Last night I was able to sleep simple because I couldn't go any longer without closing my eyes. I wish that I had the choice to fall asleep and wake up at will. That time would simply stop when my head hit the pillow (or drafting table) so that I wouldn't lose any work time. If this were so, life would be much easier. Without taking time out of my life to shower, eat or sleep I could get everything done. What is the true purpose of bathing anyway? I mean, I do it for the simple fact that I'm told by society that it's necessary for me to be accepted by the general populous. But, in all reality, if we didn't shower none of us would know the difference. I think that's my main complaint about the world in which we live. There is too much US. Why can't it just be I, sometimes? Rather than worry constantly about what Sarah might wear or what Jessica might do with her hair, why can't we just live and experience and BE without the everpresent pressure of impression and attitude. When, I'm inclined to wonder, did everyone begin to care so much about TRYING so damn hard to lose their own individuality. What's the most disgusting, I believe, is that there are those out there who try so hard to find their own that, eventually, even THAT catches on, and then, once again, they become part of a click or group. Here in lies my love and passion for architecture. But, it will also be my crutch, and possibly my ultimate failure. With it I can create and design and people will experience what I'm feeling and they won't be able to say, ""Wow, that's cool, why don't I do that,"" without enlisting my services. (In a perfect world) They will, however, be able to say ""Wow, that's cool (or awful as the case may be) I want to be in this space. "" On the opposite note, however, the only way I'll be able to express myself through my work will be to appeal to the masses or at least a mass large enough to want to pay me to build my building. So, in order for me to survive and be able to be different and interesting, I will have to find a group of people that are on the same wavelength as I am, which is essentially what I'm trying to avoid. It's a Catch22 and there's no way around it. I suppose I could step to the side and be a Howard Roark of the world and live day by day surviving off the few people who may honor my integrity and desire for design, but, just like everyone else, I crave human contact and acceptance. I am too afraid of myself to be myself. I am too afraid to find out that I don't know what I am or to realize that everything I thought was, I'm really the opposite of and have only been playing a game my entire life, just trying to make an impression. I am so scared that I really am a failure, but somehow I've been lucky. Somehow, I pulled off those SAT's and I pulled off those straight A's, but as soon as I find out who I really am, I'll fall off of this full speed train toward success and end up in a field somewhere surrounded by no one. I don't even want to be successful anymore. I don't even want to be anymore. I just want to experience. I just want to know and think without the pressure of success or failure. I'm not sure what we're all trying for, but I do know that whatever it is, can wait until we've died. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I have been asked to do this psychology assignment of writing down my train of thoughts and feelings for twenty minutes with out stopping. So far that was my first train of thought  I know it's a boring intro sentence, but yet I'm not allowed to stop and think of how to write more eloquently. I guess that leads me to my next thought  school. This is my first semester at college and there is so much going on. When you asked to write down our stress factor on a scale of 17, I believe I might have marked an 8. There are so many things that are going on, and I want to be able to organize everything in time slots. The only thing is that they keep giving me stuff to do. I suppose you would define ""they"" as professors with homework and S. I meetings, which I really want to attend. Then I had my first sorority meeting last night, and they have so much in store for us this semester. I suppose I should tell you that I love going home  not to see my family (will, sort of that too  you got to love mom and dad!), but I have boyfriend back at Houston. I was planning on going home all these weekends, but it turns out that I have something I have to do that is mandatory on almost every weekend. This boyfriend of mine is totally worth the trouble and stress of going home. I have had the most amazing summer with him just hanging out and doing fun activities. He makes me feel ten times happier when I'm around him and it's just really hard not having him here to help me adjust into this new life style. I do however, talk to him everyday and write him letters. The first week I arrived in Austin, I can honestly say that it sucked because rush drained a lot out of me and then we had to start school with no breaks from rush week. I thought I would be able to adjust better in this big place, because I consider myself an easy going friendly person. There is just so much that is consuming my life right now that I hardly have time to stop and think about what I need to do. I love exercising and used to do it everyday, and now I haven't had time to do any of that this past week because of school. I just hate this time in my life right now when everything is so jumbled up in my brain. I can't wait for the day when I have everything organized and I don't feel too constrained to one aspect of my life. I also hate this time because you don't really know anybody. True, I've met people and they are all really nice, but I haven't gotten to that stage when you can say anything to them and not look stupid. I am really glad that I did join the sorority just so I can meet people, but there are 60 people that I can meet and that's just too much for me to build strong friendships all at once. I do have some friends from back home, but I hardly have time to visit with them because I'm so consumed with everything else. I just need to sit down and relax. I did go home for Labor Day to visit my boyfriend, and that was exactly what I needed  just to hang out with someone who knows you so well. We did basically nothing and it was great not having to worry about anything. That weekend I think was somewhat a turning point in my attitude of college. It just made me realize that it is harder than I thought (adjusting wise) but everything turns out okay in the end. Plus I was happy to know that I do have somebody who loves me just as much as I love him; and that when I'm missing him, he's thinking about me too. I guess it just made me feel not so lost in college knowing that I have a great person back home supporting me every step of the way. Okay, twenty minutes are up. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Sometimes I think of what other people are thinking. I watch the way people stare or the way they look at the ground when they walk. They must be thinking about things that they have to do or even things that they have just finished doing. I don't understand how we can have thoughts that are so evident in your mind, but completely shut out from anyone else's knowledge. I feel strange in the fact that I am putting my thoughts into words. Though I am concentrating on writing, I am also able to let my mind wander while I write. The way I think and the way I process my thoughts has changed since I've been in college. Leaving home so early forced me to grow up, which I desperately needed, and it also made me understand all the things that I have at home. My life in Austin is good, but it is missing all those people that I made such a major part of my life. I wonder if those people will ever be there again. My family, of course, will always be there, but the others might not. My friends and my boyfriend are the ones that I spent ever spare moment with. Now that I am in a completely different city, my spare moments are spent thinking of them. I always travel back in time, in my head, to the days I spent with them. Every weekend, after school, and on vacations are the times I had with them. Maybe they are thinking the same way. I can't help but remember those days that we just did nothing productive. Those were the easiest and funnest times of my life. My mother always told me that college is the funnest time, but I have yet to see what she is talking about. My mother is great. Now I realize all the things she has done for me. She was always there for me, and even now that I am hundreds of miles away, she still there. I was distracted by the distant voices behind me. They seem to be discussing a project. Some kind of stress has been put on this group. I am assuming that they have procrastinated their work and are now hurrying to finish it. Stress is one thing that I cannot deal with. When I stress I start to think a lot. When I think, I get really nostalgic, and eventually get very sad that I no longer can do the things I used to do in the past. Some people beside me are also using the computer. Their minds seem to be captured by their work, and they seem so occupied that they would never even notice that I am writing about them. If I were to turn my head and watch them for a second, they wouldn't notice that either. I can always feel someone looking at me. Even if it was only a slight glance, through the corner of my eyes I can see someone look. Even when I don't see them, the weight of their stare causes my awareness of it. After this writing assignment is finished, I have to drive through Austin's traffic to get home. That is the only thing I can't stand about going home. What should only take five minutes, ends up being a half an hour drive. Things like that frustrate me. The light rail system is supposed to fix that traffic problem. I have a feeling that Austin is going to be just like Houston, and now matter what type of construction is done, the traffic is never going to be fixed. It is difficult to try to find a quick, easy and inexpensive way to ease the congestion in the city. Pretty soon, people are going to be so sick of it that they will move out into the country. After that, the county will start to get overpopulated and the cycle will start again. "
Tell me about yourself.,"This is my first actual assignment of college so far. I've gotten all the homework assignments and practice problems, but this is the first one that really counts. At least it is the first assignment that I know of that really counts. Of course, I'm not exactly sure what the professor is looking for, but I'm doing my best. I'm just hoping I'll get a good grade for this. So far, I'm having a lot of fun here in the lovely University of Texas at Austin. It's a lot of work, but then again, I know it will pay off in the long run. And despite the small forest I've killed so far making flash cards for Spanish and Medical Terminology, its actually kind of fun. I like being busy, and I like doing things that lead to something bigger. In this case, it will hopefully lead to medical school. But that's enough about school, after all, I only live on campus, I'm surrounded by it! I'm in a great mood today and I have no idea why. I'm really hyper, and I didn't really do anything that unusual. I didn't eat an entire bag of Pixy Stix or anything. I did go swimming today, not nearly as much as I used to, but apparently it was enough to actually get some endorphins (if that's right) pumping. Now all I need to do is keep up that routine. I'm wide awake, and ready to go, even it is eight o'clock in the evening, and I have about a dozen other things I should really get around to doing. At least I'm organized though. I didn't really think that would pay off that much in school at least not right away, but it is. I can't wait until my birthday; I'll finally be eighteen! Its kind of funny how much a birthday can mean. Even though it's not that big of a deal, it's still exciting. Although the only thing I can do is go to clubs and join the military, and neither of those are exactly my kind of thing. It'll be nice to have people stopping and being completely amazed that a seventeen year old is actually in college. Will wonders never cease? Oh well, its all fun and games and it means presents! Shallow, but its nice to get things. Especially when you're one of those people who usually manages to remember everyone's birthday, even if it is a few days or weeks late. What matters is that I remember! I just like doing things like that, it makes everyone feel special, as pathetic as that sounds. I feel like this is the most incoherent thing I've ever written. I'm just rambling all over the place, but I hope this is what the professor is looking for. If this is stream of consciousness, I'm amazed anyone can actually read this kind of thing. It would drive me crazy to have to read all this rambling. As completely crazy and illogical as what I have written is, its nice to just be able to switch subjects like mad. It's a nice change from the whole introduction, body, and conclusion type of paper. Still, this style of writing is very refreshing and it's a lot more challenging than I thought. I've never really sat down and tried to follow my thoughts for twenty minutes. I guess I just don't have that much to think about, judging from what I have written. And it's sad because I've actually written a fair amount of absolutely nothing. Who would have guessed I could spend twenty whole minutes just writing this kind of thing? "
Tell me about yourself.,"Alright, well right now I have no idea what to write. I don't know what my professor is expecting this to say and I do not know what all of the other students are writing about. I don't really want to get too personal just in case I get to be the lucky one who's homework is spotchecked. I am worrying that school is not being focused on as much as it should be. I sometimes think that I am going to be able to get by as easily as I did in high school when at the same time I know that that is not the case at all. I know that I am going to have to study so much more than I ever have and it freaks me out. Especially since I am not so sure that I know exactly how to study. I don't want to go into an exam thinking that I know all the information and then have no clue what the test is saying to me. I want to do so well this semester and in a way I have to if I want to transfer into the school of communications next semester. And the fact that I heard the other day that Professor Pennebaker is the hardest psychology teacher here did not help much. I didn't think he seemed that hard but apparently he is. And I also am freaking out about the whole sorority thing. I am having so much fun with it but it is taking up a lot of my time and so are all of the parties that go with it. I have to decide whether or not I want to go home on Saturday for the night. I want to see my parents and my friends but I don't know if it is worth it. And also I don't want to get really sad when I am there. I am worried that I am not going to really want to come back. That is not saying that I am not having such a fun time here but I think that me not wanting to come back after a night at home is a possibility. I am having so much fun here but it is a lot of stuff to deal with sometimes. And it is like I am never capable of being alone. And when I am alone, its when I don't really want to be alone. There are always things going on and people around when I just want to relax and sit down. But that is never possible. And there is so much to do all the time that studying is so hard to fit into my schedule. But I do have to admit that I am studying because I know I am more than some of my friends. Friends is another thing that kind of scares me. I hope that my best friends from home and I don't lose touch just because there are so many new faces here and everyone is wanting to meet new people. I just kind of wish that I knew who my group of friends is going to be so that I can start hanging out with them and making memories that are going to count. Okay, well I hope that this is what you expected from my 20 minutes of writing because I had no idea what else to write. Now maybe you can look at the way my brain works and help me deal with my problems. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Ok, 20 minutes. To start off, I should probably write a little longer than 20 minutes. If I only write for 20 minutes, you're not going to get very much. That's because my typing skills are way below even pitiful, much less below average. The reason for that is that I'm twice as old as most of the rest of the students in this class, and consequently did not grow up using a computer as they did. As a matter of fact, there weren't any computers at all in my high school. The only computers that the entire school district had were the ones that counted holes in punch cards. I took all my first standardized tests by punching holes in cards. Those were probably the only computers in the entire city. Wait, that's not true; some of the most advanced computers in the entire world were probably there. I grew up in Amarillo, which is where the Pantex plant is located. Pantex(although they'll never admit it, it's common knowledge) is the final assembly point for all the nuclear weapons for the United States. Just a wild guess, but they probably had some pretty cool computers out there. What else? oh, I hope I can just write this here and hit submit, because being technostupid, I don't have a clue as to how to do any of that cutandpaste black magic. As a precautionary measure, I'm going to print it up. If it doesn't go through, I'll have to paper your office with printed copies and bother you with emails. OK, how long has it been? 14 minutes. My guess is that after 14 minutes, most of those folks will have come up with with 20 times what I have here. I hear them over in the computer center at the UGL with their flying fingers. Damned showoffs. But enough about me. Tell me about yourself. Never mind. Bad joke The next thing that pops up sort of relates to that first stuff. What in the hell is an old fart like me doing in a university in the first place? Well, I really, really screwed it up the first time. I couldn't be bothered to go to class back then; I had dope to deal. Well, it was the early 70s, there was a lot of that going on. So when I got fed up and pissed off in the job I had, I decided to look for a new job. Being tired of the whole restaurant business, I looked through the entire classified section, only to find that everyone wanted you to have a degree. It didn't have to have anything to do with what they did, they just wanted you to have one. The ad that tore it for me was for some retail place in the mall, I can't even remember which one, listed only 2 qualifications: a college degree, and the ability to lift 25 pounds. @#%$&&^%! So here I am. Now it's 23 minutes. See what I mean? I just did a quick division since that last timecheck and using the number of lines, it comes to about 1820 words a minute. I'm surprised the keyboard's not smoking. I'll go on for a couple of minutes more here. You probably haven't had nearly enough boring stuff to read today. Now I'm stretching to find things to say. Was that the point of this deal? To prove that more than 20 minutes of sustained thought was too much to sustain? If so I've more than proved the point here. Even 20(well, getting close to 30 now) has proved to be a stretch. Enough. I'm sending this thing. I hope you get it. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Ok, twenty minutes has started. Well, I feel like I'm trying to keep up with everything, hoping I don't forget some meeting or instruction session I was supposed to go to. I'm thinking I really like UT so far and I feel I'm where I need to be. I miss my puppy, he's the cutest Dalmatian in the worldI named him Tex. He's my little childI taught him how to give me five! I wish I could go see some of my brother and sister's games, I'm sure they are kicking some butt. I've been thinking about the long distance relationship I'm in, and wondering if maybe I would like to date other people. I mean, he's already been to college, and had his fun, so I think I would like to just date people, but how do you say that to someone? Oh well, he's in Hawaii for two weeks, so whatever happens while he's outside of the continental U. S. doesn't count, right? Just kidding. I'm glad that I came to Austin, I get to see my grandmother a lot, and we've always been close, so that's good. I'm surprised that my roommate and I are getting along so well. We've known each other for a long time, and I had anticipated some problems, but so far we are just peachy. I have a feeling or two to share I hate Linguistics! I was worried about taking my Spanish class because it's upper division, and it has been awhile since I was as sharp with it as when I took the AP test, but I'm loving it. Glad I've been working out lately I love that feeling. This is the first year I will not be playing competitive volleyball, and I am definitely suffering from withdrawals. Kind of makes me wish I had gone somewhere small to play. When I look at it though, I think I made the right decision. Even though my parents thought my room was disgustingly little, I am really liking dorm life. This is cool. I want an apartment next year so I can bring lil Tex down with me. Speaking of feelings, I hate the phrase ""Is it hot enough for ya?"" If someone says that to me one more time Whoops, I guess this isn't a pet peeve writing assignment. The sensations that I have been feeling lately are sensations of extreme heat whenever I step outside! I loved this country place we went to the other night, even though it was far from country. Twostepping reminds me of my ex who is still calling. I plan to work out at least 4 times a week now, I'm just so sick of being the group fatty. My friend and I were talking about how we don't have any ugly friends, which I guess is good and bad. Good because, I guess being cute always is, and bad, because that means lots of competition! :) I just don't want to be the biggest one anymore. That whole last tangent makes no sense to me, so I'm sure if you choose to read this line, it will make none to you either. Well, my 20's up! Hope it was good reading!  "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm so excited that my computer is doing what it is supposed to be doing today. Its really cool that I can watch movies through this sucker. Are you just supposed to write about whatever? This is pretty cool. I wanted to roller blade and some piece of crap girl told me I couldn't because some cop told her she'd get a $50 ticket, and plus it was raining, so that sucks. I am so ready to go out. I'm getting tired of sitting in my room all the time. I wonder what Jason thinks about me. Does he still want to get back together with his exgirlfriend that sucks. If he does then he's stupid because I'm probably way cooler than her, and she's only a junior in high school. That's ridiculous. Boy's are so stupid sometimes. I can't believe the things they do. I want to play hockey. I miss playing hockey with my neighbors. Maybe I'll find somewhere to roller blade, and I'll be able to play hockey. That'd be good. Shannon wanted me to teach her how to play anyway so that would work out well since she's an RA. She'd probably know of a place around here that is good to skate on. Man, I wish my hair would grow out. It looks so dumb since its too short to get into a good pony tail and I don't feel like fixing it most of the time. I want to get purple streaks put in it. That would be pretty interesting. What if I got my eyebrow or my lip pierced? I bet that'd be weird. Just to look at yourself in the mirror with that would be different, plus my mom wouldn't freak out or anything. I hope radio shack gets that 6foot cord in soon, so I can get this TV thing working better and get some of these stupid cords out of my way. I'm glad Jason traded cable connectors with me, so I could move the TV across the room. He wasn't using the length of it anyway. I really wish my mom hadn't sold my Nintendo, Mario 3 sure would be fun right about now. I wish I was funnier. I can't ever say anything funny. I only laugh at other people or at myself when I do something stupid or klutzy. That was so funny when Bobby ran into that pole. I still can't get over that. He's a weird guy, but he sure is cute. At least Chris is finally being half nice to me. That's different. I still can't believe he sat by me in sociology today. That's so weird. Matt is my friend and he never sits by me. Butt hole. I need to read for that class. I'm glad I only have one 1 o'clock class on Fridays, so I can sleep late. I hate getting up early. It sucks bad. Ultimate Frisbee would be so fun on Saturday. Nicole is lucky to get to be in rowing. I want to join something. I halfway miss track, but not quite. It really sucks with Coach McCoy yelling at you all the time. I don't know what the crap this thing is. Stupid cat. Radio Shack always tries to rip you off. That was weird when I got in that fight with the lady at the hotel in Cancun. She was so bitchy. I can't believe she thought we would steal the nasty bedspread from their skanky hotel. I want Lindsey and Jason to come visit me. I miss them. Dorks still in high school. Oh, well. I hope Lindsey is liking cheerleading more than she did her freshman year. I don't want her to go to Baylor next year. She needs to come her. That would be cool, but then I wouldn't be able to have any fun because I'd be afraid that she would get mad at me. I know I shouldn't care what Jason thinks since we only met like three weeks ago, but that boy is driving me crazy. He's so hard to read. I need to get in touch with Rachel and see what is up with her new baby brother or sister and find out what Taylor's address in Iowa is. For someone who liked me so much, he should have told me when he was leaving or something. What a spaz monkey! I wish I could get in touch with Tony. Eww. I need to call Preston. He's a weirdo. I need to see what concerts are coming up. He always knows all that crazy crap. That guy matt is pretty cool. I should email him or something. I need to go visit Roy. He's in a fraternity. Frats are so weird. They only seem to talk about their brothers and crap. Nicole is getting on my nerves somewhat. I know I shouldn't let the little stuff bother me, but when I'm with her all the time, its insane. Why can't she breathe with her mouth shut when she's sleeping. She needs to blow her nose or something. Anyway. This is a good song. I want to hear that Incubus song. That's awesome. "
Tell me about yourself.,"What am I thinking? Well, I'm sitting in my dorm room alone right now. It's quite relaxing actually. My roommate has been rushing all week and finally decided what sorority she will join yesterday. She joined Alpha Xi Delta. When I returned to my humble abode last night I found our room decorated by her sorority sisters. The room looked really nice except for the balloons that made it cumbersome to walk. My roommate is nice. I didn't know her before we came here. It has been a good experience getting to know her and living with someone. I have never lived with anyone in such close quarters before. I think it's good for a person. It makes you realize just how many things you do that you don't even think about. I have to be so conscious of all the things I do so as not to disturb my roommate. That's enough talk about my roommate. I am thoroughly enjoying my freshman year at college so far. I am taking 12 hours and my classes actually seem to be interesting. I think it's amazing how much you grow up and change without even realizing it. Looking back over my life I have seem myself change. I think for the better. I have always been a lifeguard during the summer to get some extra cash. Last summer I managed a pool at a country club. I never thought I would be able to have anyone respect my authority and me. My lifeguards did what I told them too and the summer turned out great. I saw how I had to mature to be the leader where I had always been the follower previously. I just think it's amazing how you go through experiences and change because of them. That is what I am hoping to get out of college; an experience that will forever change me. I am dating a sophomore here at the university. We have been dating for a little over a year. I was extremely excited about coming to college this year because of the time we will share. Last year we had to do the whole longdistance relationship thing. It was really hard and expensive between trips and phone cards. His parents also do not allow him to date in college because of academic reasons. He is not a bad student, but they want him to have zero distractions. I don't know how they can honestly think that he will have zero distractions at college, but who am I to argue? All last year that left us with the task of hiding our relationship. We both really, really like what we have together and are nowhere near wanting to give it up. We made the commitment to work through this. It is much easier now that we are at the university because his parents can't watch over him all the time. He just left my room. We were watching my roommate's television. He is a baseball freak so we were watching baseball highlights. It was relaxing at the least. Over all I had a good first day at college. The only thing that didn't go smoothly was finding my first class. It was in building LLB, the hardest building to find on campus. I did eventually find it after asking about 15 different people. Our class was locked outside for about ten minutes though. The teacher didn't have a key. We did get in to our room after a few short minutes. I am quite amazed that I could write this much in just barely 20 minutes. I would maybe be inclined to write more, but I am extremely tired and I have to get up for my next set of classes tomorrow. I know this sounds like kissing up, but I am truly interested in this class. I hope I learn many interesting things. "
Tell me about yourself.,"so many things to do. must read in rhetoric today. two whole chapters. I wonder if I should drop that class. she seems nice but only gives 3 or 4 A's. I could be one of those A's. but what if I'm one of those C's that she says are ""solid writers""?? wish I was a good writer. after I read must read chemistry and psychology if I don't start soon I'll never start. and lord knows if I get behind in any of my classes, I'll never catch up again. I'm glad that I bought the notes today for chemistry. now I know what to study. but it was expensive our professor must be making a fortune! can't wait until 7:30pm I can take a break from life and focus on me! me me me me. I'll finally be able to go to the gym and work out. I've gained so much weight already. I wonder if my boyfriend notices and just doesn't say anything. I bet he notices. he never complements me anymore. I'm a little disappointed in myself for letting my self go. I should've been more cautious about my eating habits. sometimes I just eat because there's nothing to do not because I'm hungry. I know that's wrong. to make matters worse my boyfriend is such a hard core work out freak. although I'm skinny, I'm slowly losing my girlish figure that attracted him to me. I know for a fact he can do better than me, but why is he with me? he says I'm everything anyone could ever want but I have so many flaws. for instance, I have the quickest temper and stubbornness in the whole wide world. my hair is still damp from taking a shower. that shower was good. it washed away the whole afternoon. all the stress. I hate being late. that's probably why I'm always half an hour early for all my classes. everyone thinks I'm a nerd but I just consider myself punctual. quite an overachiever. I like being an overachiever. it's the most commonly used word to describe me with. I always try to get ahead. that's why I'm always so stressed out. sometimes I wish I was not such a worry wart. I want to be laid back, really I do, but my happiness comes with having everything done and done on time and done well. the feeling of finishing and completing everything thoroughly and fully is the best feeling in the whole world. and that's what makes me an overachiever. this project isn't even done now. it's supposed to be done in a couple of weeks. I tried to do this project the day after proof. pennebaker assigned it but for some odd reason the site was down. I guess it just wasn't meant to be. hmmm. what should I eat for dinner. it's $0. 30 chicken wing night at pluckers. I live right above pluckers so it'd be easy to get to but I still have left overs in the fridge so I'll save myself the 3 or 5 dollars and eat in AGAIN. I wish I was rich. I wouldn't have to worry about how much dinner cost. I remember the day when it used to be like that. but I'm glad I ran away. I'm with jeff now and he's better than having all the money in the world. I kind of regret not going to boston college though. that was my dream. that was my huge sigh of relief after high school. that was the product of 12 years of overachieving. UT isn't bad. it's not great either. some people say it's like an Ivy League school but I highly doubt that. I would pick an east coast school over hicktown UT anytime. but since I'm here I have to make the best of this situation and endure the poor weather and large campus. six more minutes of writing. that means I can start thinking about what to do next. I think I'll read psychology since that's what I'm doing now. just the first chapter tonight then the first chapter in chemistry. that should do me for now then rhetoric I have to read chapters two through three. I think I've got it together now. 4 more minutes. wow, it's already been twenty minutes! this assignment relieved me of a lot of stress already! now I just have to read and take really good notes. no more online junk to take care of anymore. I have using the computer. don't people know that handwriting things is the best way to learn and memorize? well, I guess for me others love it. yes one more minute. I think I'll snack and study. it keeps me motivated. I guess that's it. I enjoyed this project! "
Tell me about yourself.,"My feet really hurt. I wish I would have made that dance team. if that stupid bitch lina had made it, I wouldn't feel so bad. I have always hated her. She is a stupid fat whore who I hope does not succeed in life and ends up as fat as her mother. Having an abortion and then denying it, what a lying sack. I hate people like that. I want my computer to work all the time. I am so sick of it being messed up all the time. Tracy dropped psychology. Damn. I was hoping we could get to know each other by studying together and going to class together. That would be really nice. I need to meet more people here. I like hanging out with all my old friends, but I need to meet some more. Those dance girls were all airheads though. Maybe it is a good thing that I didn't make it. I would have to around all hose goof ball people all the time. That would kind of suck. Man, I wish I could loose some weight. I am not going to if I keep eating all this shitty dorm food. With as much as I work out, I should be loosing weight. Why not. Mark wants to loose weight just as much as I do, but I guess it is just as hard for guys to loose weight as it is for girls. Whatever. I am already tired of this assignment. I guess it is better that having some tight ass paper to write. My rhetoric response paper sucked. I hope I get a good grade on it though. I have to make good grades this year. I will die if I don't. I want to, and my parents will kill me if I don't. not enough time for sex though. I guess when you first start having sex you want to do it all the time. Too bad mark doesn't want to. I wish he was just a little bit more of a horn ball. What a weird thing to say. I girl wanting a guy to be a little bit more horny. Isn't it supposed to be the other way around? Whatever. I really want to have sex now. Look what I d id to myself. That girl on the south mall was really weird. There are no hot guys in any of my classes. Well at least that I can see. I can't see anyone in my huge ass classes 200540 people. What bullshit! This is such a huge school. It's ridiculous. My hands hurt because I am typing so fast and so much. Whatever. Need to pop my knuckles. There. I can't believe that Ken Reynolds died that is crazy 42 years old. That really scares me. If matt calls in the middle of the night one more time, I think I am going to throw the computer at the wall. I love this song ""falling from grace"" It is awesome. It makes me think of a movie. I'm not sure which one though. Maybe some drug movie or something. All that reading I have to do. College is way harder than I am wanting right now. I need more time for friends, sex, fun all that stuff. I think tomorrow after Mark comes over we will sleep for a while and then maybe we will mess around. I don't know. We always do if we are alone in bed for any period of time. I am so excited about the football game. I get to sit with who. let's see. Lindsey, Mark, and Ian, is that it? I can't even remember. Oh yeah wes did not have a sports package, and david did not give them his id. Man my neck hurts. I need another massage. That felt so good. I can't believe that Lindsey has Natalie in her Rhetoric class. I hope I get a good grade on my rhetoric response paper. I need to start off with good grades and then try to keep them up rather than start off with bad grades and then try to get them up. This is really not that bad of an assignment. I can handle it pretty well. I wonder who is on the phone. It must be Ian. What a weird kid. He is cool though. I am glad to have him as a friend. I wish Wes would be a little more open when I try to talk to him. He is nice and I think he likes me fine, but he just always acts strange around me like he is uncomfortable. except when we are drunk. Then we are like old friends. Who knows about that boy. He has a complex mind. It was nice of him to say that he would be my assistant editor any time. I'd be his for sure. He was drunk when he said that though. I hope he meant. Most people say that you say the truth when you are drunk, but some people think that you make stuff up when you are drunk. I don't, but I know some people do. I just want to have some new friends. I think I am going to friends with tracy she is nice and every time I see her, we talk for a while. Today, she said they were having a gijoe barbie party tomorrow night. All the girls come as barbie and all the guys come as gijoe. That sounds like fun. I kind of wish I was in a sorority, but I guess I will live. Oh well. There's twenty minutes. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Okay, here we go. I am going to type continuously for 20 minutes. I don't know how I can do this considering that I type pretty fast and also I am in the UGL and the keys are making quite a loud clicky noise with each letter that I type. Oh well, no one seems to be listening. I am really tired right now and all I can think about is sleeping soundly in my comfortable bed. drifting into a relaxing deep sleep. IT'S ONLY BEEN ONE MINUTE! I can't do this for that long. I have nothing interesting on my mind. hmmmmm I had a fun time last night. I got in at 6 in the morning. IF only my mother could see me now. that's the latest I've ever gotten in. am I typing loud? I don't want to do this anymore. I am very nervous about people looking over my shoulder right now at this very instant reading at the ridiculous things that I am typing. bored bored bored bored. I miss my friend jennifer a lot. we talked earlier this week and she said she would call me back. but she never did. today in Barnes and noble I was by myself looking at books and saw one that reminded me of jennifer and I really felt like bursting out in tears right there in the middle of that bookstore. somehow I held it back. hell right now I want to cry. I really miss all of my Dallas friends like so much. we've been through everything together and it's like we're drifting apart. I guess it's inevitable, though. I mean I've seen it a thousand times in films: the classic high school seniors move away to college scenario. but I never thought that it really would be this hard. I'm living on my own. I am my own mother now. That's pretty damn scary! I think I'm responsible though. I've always been able to manage my time wisely. Even my mom agrees with that. IT'S ONLY BEEN 3 MINUTES. or 4 maybe. I really like this guy I met. like really. it's just something about him. and it's so disenchanting that he's playing hard to get with me. I'm a very sensitive person with not a lot of dating experience, so games are not my idea of fun. I hope he's not looking over my shoulder right now. I'm really paranoid right now. I don't want him to see that I'm writing about him for this. god, if he saw this he would freak out. he probably thinks I'm stalking him anyway. I'm really not. I think I am inventing things in my head. I do that a lot. I can't believe I'm writing all this out for this assignment. oh well, this is probably not even going to be read by anyone. Well, hopefully not. I mean this is pretty boring stuff, teenager's brains. YIKES! so okay it's given that this will not be read. at least I am assuming that it is. So, with that in mind I really am open to write whatever the hell I want to write. This is for my benefit, in essence. Like a diary entry that you turn in for a grade. Not typical, but hey it happens. oh god! I really like that guy. I hope he shares something like that about me. he said he'll call me tomorrow. maybe. he did say maybe. then he said maybe Tuesday. Hell, I'm sick of waiting around for this guy. I always do this. I cling on so fast to people I'm interested in even after just meeting them. It's like I have a onetrack mind and it's all I can think about. That's pretty scary, huh? Wow I just scrolled up and I've written a lot. A lot of really boring stuff too. He probably won't call tomorrow. Who am I kidding? I can't keep doing this to myself. It's really unhealthy. I just want to cry after realizing this. It's such a horrible thing. I am putting this guy up on a pedestal  is that how you spell it?  and like if he messes up just a little bit, then I think that he hates me and I'm just this horrible person. God I say the stupidest things around him sometimes. I'm so concerned with trying to impress him that I just end up saying stupid things. that he won't even remember, but I am again blowing it out of proportion. Who am I kidding, I need to get my mind off this guy. but grrrrr! everyone now compared to him just doesn't seem to measure up. Like everyone I meet, I hold off on just for that rare chance that I might get to date this guy. I am a weird person. I am still paranoid about people looking over my shoulder. It feels like the whole world is scrutinizing me. Whoa that's scary. I love embellishing in my selfpity. it's so encouraging. NOT REALLY. wow the whole lab is completely silent except for my really loud typing. I feel like each letter I type is a clap of thunder booming and echoing into the distance. time is like momentarily slowed down and every thunder clasp is loudly emphasized. Wow, my 20 minutes are almost up. How did that go so fast? What did I write about? I can't even remember. I really don't want to look back at what I wrote either because I'm sure it's just the same thing over and over again. but I'm sure I will look back at it in just a second. well, if anyone is reading this, I envy your patience. until next time. That is all. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm not really sure exactly what to write. It seems very hard to me to just think naturally and turn those thoughts over to a piece of paper (or computer). What to write, what to write. I hope I don't get interrupted while I'm writing this paper. The computer makes a slightly weird humming noise. There are so many papers surrounding my computer. I wonder where the dark spots on the wall came from? It's hard to think of things to write, but I guess the purpose of this exercise is NOT to think what to write but to write what you think. That sounds very profound. I'm kind of proud of myself for thinking that last thought. Ouch. I wonder if this is going to feel like it took a long time. I need to work out, and I have to work tonight. I'm glad I'm quitting that job, and I hope the business starts to make money soon or I'm going to be broke. I don't really have many bills to pay, but I need to pay off my car. I wonder what Justin is going to get me. I don't think it will be jewelry. I hope he likes his present. I never get him as good of gifts as he gives me except for the VCR and Nintendo 64, but those still don't make up for everything he has bought. I guess it shouldn't matter because that's not a measure of our love, but it's nice to give and receive nice things. I wish my cold would go away. It would be nice to go to bed without having to take Nyquil first. I'm tired of being stuffed up, and I'd like to get back into working out since I'm feeling a little better. I'm just afraid that I won't feel better if I go work out while I'm sick. I haven't even done pushups in a week! I feel very fat, but it hasn't been that long since I've worked out. My muscle atrophies rather quickly. That's probably because I didn't row last year. I wish I could've done that, but the new coaches just sucked. I'm definitely going to get my own skull when I get older. I hope I will be very successful. I know I will be successful, but I want to make a lot of money! My wrist is beginning to hurt. I shouldn't be resting my wrists on the table in front of me. I learned that my freshmen year in high school in keyboarding class, but it's just easier. I guess I'm just being lazy. I feel like I'm forgetting something that I'm supposed to do tonight or tomorrow. I like this whole college thing. I don't have to worry so much because I have more time to do things. I just hope it's not going to be too hard. I don't know why I doubt myself. I've just heard so many times that the people who do well in high school struggle in college because they're used to high school, and high school is so much easier. I don't know! I like to fidget. I remember Mrs. Merkord telling us that people who fidget tend to lose weight more easily. I think that's possibly true. It's just hard for me to lose my legs because I inherited their shape and size from my mom. I wish they could just be thin. They aren't really fat, but they're muscular/big. That's just the way I feel because all of these Texas women have thin legs. They also have thick middles though, and I don't. That's horrible! I shouldn't be bad mouthing people even in my head. Not all Texas women are like that. It just seems to be a majority. My back hurts a little from walking around so much yesterday on campus with my purse and my book bag on my right shoulder. I'd switch, but it just feels awkward. I feel like I'm not thinking any specific thoughts right now. I'm just concentrating on writing. What was I just thinking? This exercise is kind of fun when you get going. I really was getting the hang of typing and thinking together just a little while ago. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I don't ever know what to talk about in these damned things, although I know that the point is just to write whatever comes to mind. Nothing ever seems worth committing to anything besides a fleeting second of short term memory. My eye itches. I wish Keith would stop singing that opera crap so I could concentrate on what I am doing. Oh, wait, this is what I am supposed to be doing. My head itches. What am I going to do about Elizabeth? On one hand, I want to be free to enjoy college life, having my own apartment, and the like, but at the same time, I wonder if pushing her away will be the biggest mistake I ever make in my life. Sometimes I kind of wish that someone else were making decisions for me, or at least the tough ones. My stomach hurts a lot, thinking about this all the time. I hope I don't get a ulcer. That really would suck. My head itches again. I wonder what Jeff is doing tonight; I should call him and see if he knows of any parties going on. I should probably take this keg shell back and get my deposit. Is Charlie here? He needs to call his mom. Oh crap, I was supposed to call my mom back. It will have to wait though. Damn homework. I wonder if I have anything else to do tonight besides this. Economics. no, Chemistry. no, Philosophy. no, cool no other homework. I wish I could type as fast as I think, that would be nice. I hope my mom isn't too mad that I'm not coming home this weekend. she'll get over it. I hope she understands though; I wouldn't want to hurt her feelings. She really is good to me; so is Dad though. I wonder if Dad is back from his trip yet; he sure is out of town a lot. Maybe he will retire soon, and live off mutual funds. He'll probably wait for Katie to move out though. I wonder if Dean will ever move out; maybe he's finally got his act together  I hope he does, anyway. I wish I could do something to help him out  if nothing else but to see where he could be, where his potential lies. I think even if I could find the words, he would not take the time to listen, or be willing to listen, one or the other. Is time up yet? No. Hmmm. what am I thinking now? All these question marks. makes me feel like the Riddler or something. I wonder if that means anything, that my ""stream of consciousness assignment is flooded with question marks. Apparently, there are still many questions in my life. Will they ever be answered? More question marks  great. So many questions, and not enough resources to answer them by. Not to mention the fact that no one can help because no one else is in the situation. I wish there were some way to link with someone  make them feel what you feel and know what you know  maybe get some reliable advice for a change. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I feel good about hanging out with different people throughout the day. I find that it gets so monotonous when I see the same person day in and day out. I don't like feeling trapped in a relationship, so I guess I am very wary of commitment, although I wouldn't mind starting a relationship with someone. I miss the physical contact of a relationship. Maybe I haven't been getting enough hugs lately. I haven't had one for about a week now. It does make a difference. You have to fend for yourself here at UT. No one is going to be your babysitter, and sometimes that's hard for me to accept. I have to take care of my own health, academic career, make my own friends and spend time with them, and also join organizations that I deem worthwhile. It seems like a lot of responsibility, but I am gradually learning how to handle it. I have never realized before how incredibly independent I am. I am in fact, lonely a lot more than I thought I was. At home I didn't feel it as much because I lived with four other people. But now, I notice that I get timid when I am alone. I didn't have a roommate for 2 weeks, and I thought I would like it because I would get privacy and free reign over the room. But I didn't realize how anxious being alone made me. I started eating a lot to fill the void. I never could figure out why I binged so much before, especially during high school. But now I think that I felt alone, and I was ashamed to ask someone to be my company. So I would eat to fill the lonely space and cover the shame. That's weird how I wanted to be even more alone when I felt isolated. Now I want to get involved with people as much as possible since I have recognized the problem. Liz and I will try to hang out more now, at least once a week. I want to have my meals with at least one other person. It sucks to be alone, but at least I know that now. I have ten minutes to write. Working out sure refreshes you and makes you feel more alive, but it sure does make you tired. It's also my blood sugarit's a tad low now and I will be eating something for lunch soon. I don't want to eat alone! Maybe Brooke will eat w/me. I wonder what Jason's up to now. He had an 8:00 class this morningI think? We spent some time with each other this weekend, which was a lot of fun. I like being around him because he is so patient and has some good things to say. He's also very open about himself, which is a new thing for me. I don't know if I would want to start something with him. It would be a fun thing and add some ""extra"" to the relationship, but sometimes it makes things weird and I would not want to lose his friendship. I will just keep on doing my thing, and improving myself and if it happens, it happens. I just want to be able to spend some time with him! I know I will though. There is that Navigator lake house bash this weekend that he told me about, and I think I should go. I don't want to know what I look like in my bathing suit right now. hard workouts this week should help. Will I feel pressured a lot about GodI just don't know if I'm on the right track. I read that the best way to get closer to God is to Spend time with Him. I so don't do that. I think about God about once or twice a day. I've also heard that the good things we do are reflections of God working in us, or something. I try to remember to do those little things: hold the door for people, smile, encourage people, be honest, but also don't try to be fake friendly, because it's not in anyone's good interest. I just want to be me. God I know that you know the best way for me, don't let me be so selfabsorbed. If I just let go a little, I can go a long way with YOU. But my gosh it's hard to let go. Let me see the ways I can let go. I'm going to go get something to eat for lunch. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I can't believe he just showed up like that and expected me to let him in of course I let him in anyway. What is this control he has over me? I can't make thoughts work clearly when he looks at me. All I see are blue eyes and red hair. Deep, deep blueness. There I get lost into submission. Is it me? Is it all just something I do to myself? Where are the lines I should be drawing. Why isn't easier to know what the right thing to do is? I wonder if he's sleeping right now? I know he's home. Maybe I should knock on his window until he wakes up and lets me sleep next to him? His room is so close just right down stairs. I know he look up at me every night through his window. He's sees everybody I let in. I'll have to remember in the future the consequences of sleeping with neighbors; but what if they have crazy red hair and perfect hands? It will be an interesting year. I wonder if he'll end up hating me? or me him? no. we can at least be friends. Although, it's hard sometimes. Especially with the angel downstairs. Ha! no pun intended. I just don't understand where all the anger inside him comes from. We're so different. I'm so full of love and he's so scared of love. Maybe he just fearful and that's why he becomes so overwhelmed with anger; or maybe he's just passionate. I think that might be part of it. I read his palms and his heart line was off the chart! He asked me when I met him if I thought we'd be dangerous together and I said, ""I'm not dangerous with anybody,"" but I'm begging to change my mind. I wish I could see inside him. Usually I can read strait through boys, but he is an enigma. I guess I'll just start looking harder. If I go down there right now I know he'll wake up and be happy to see me. I'm sure he thought about me all night after the afternoon we had together. Why is it that you can see someone who fits every requirement you have for the perfect mate, but if there's no chemistry there's no relationship  at least romantically. Then you might met someone who isn't your type at all, maybe you don't even really like the same music or have the same lifestyle, but if there's chemistry you can't resist each other. Who casts the spells on us? Who laughs at our bumbling confusion? Is it all a matter of having the ideal children? Are the people we have 'chemistry' with the people who have the perfect complementary set of genes to our own? If so, how does my body know? Do my electrons match up perfectly with the spin cycles of theirs? "
Tell me about yourself.,"I guess I have no started my 20 minutes of writing for the psychology class. As I'm writing I keep on looking at the clock to see what time it is to see when I'm supposed to finish typing. I think about what I was thinking in class when you talked to us about this HW and how I wanted to talk about certain things while I was doing. But actually I start thinking about what happened tonight. We all hung out with the fraternity and just bonded by going to dinner and then going to just talk and catch up on everything we did over the summer and afterwards we played capture the flag. I wish my roommate would listen to better music. After capture the flag we all decided to go swimming instead of capture the flag because we had all gotten tired. We put it to the vote and that's what we ended up doing. Afterwards our President asked us to make this a dry event. I support him 100% because one I don't drink, two I don't think that it is necessary to drink to have a good time, and three I think that all the points that he made were very strong. My roommates had a problem with it because we are all part of the executive board and we thought that before saying that he should have asked us all instead of doing it by himself. I think that they are wrong anyhow because as President I think that Ted did the right thing in telling us not to drink and I don't think that there was a need for him to consult us. It was an executive decision. I'm debating whether I should go outside to the pool with everyone else when I'm done with that. I was supposed to get together with a friend of mine tonight but we have been playing phone tag so it's not going to happen but I will see her on Monday so I'm still happy. This weekend I have lots of things to do. I'm running through my schedule for the weekend. Tomorrow I have to meet for lunch with a friend and afterwards we are going to the lake to just hang out. I keep on thinking about what else I'm going to write and how interesting this paper really is. I have never really sat down and typed everything I'm thinking but at the same time many of my teachers have always told me that I type just like I think; this causes my grades in grammar to be much lower. My leg really hurt because me and one of my roommates were messing around and we both deadlegged each other. But after the pain that we have both caused we have promised each other that we will never do that again. We'll see if we actually will keep it but I think we will. I'm the only one in the apartment right now cause everyone else is outside. I think about everything else I could have done tonight but in all honesty the last thing I really wanted to do was to go out and actually do something. I am very happy with the way that the evening turned out even though I would still have liked to see my friend tonight. I kind of like this girl but I'm not sure. She's cute and everything but we haven't really gotten to know each other well enough to where I can say that I like her but I do think that she's kind of interested. I also think about my friend who is coming up from Southwest next week to come see and how she's going to spend the night. We have been friends for a long time and we get along great. But the thing is that we both have really flirty personalities so I'm kind of wondering if anything is going to happen. I know that it can't be too much because I have a lot of selfcontrol but at the same time I don't want thing to get weird or to have a girlfriend right now. If anything happens it will just be maybe a little cuddling here and there or maybe a kiss. We will most likely end up sleeping in the same bed but we'll see. I have the full intention of not having sex. I never have and never will until the day I get married. I have thought about being a priest for a long time so I'm just waiting for God to give me my call and I will follow His will. I really hope that he hurries up though cause I don't have a lot of patience. I think that I have a lot of qualities but patience is not one of them. I can be patient for certain things but I just hate waiting for people to give me an answer. I know that God doesn't count in that but I try to hurry Him up. One of my friends told me this summer that if you ever wanted to make God laugh all you had to do was to tell Him your plans. I'm wondering whether this will mean anything to you guys. I guess that it all depends on whether you are Christian or Catholic or simply don't believe in God or have another religion. I realize that there are a lot of people here at UT that simply doesn't believe in God and I think that that is really sad because they are missing out on a great part of life. I keep on looking at the clock and seeing how much time is left. I wish that everyone would be able to believe in God and receive the Eucharist everyday. It is the most amazing gift that God gave us. It's sad how some people just ignore God or sometimeseven laugh in His face. This was what I originally wanted to talk about when I was thinking about what I was going to write in this paper. I thought that it would be great thing to think about because there is so much that I can write on but then I realized that I couldn't do that because it would have been planned. So I decided to kind of clear my mind and just speak my mind. For the most part I think that it worked because as I think back of all the things that I have written for the past 20 minutes I have gone through various different topics. Ranging from drinking, to girls, to God. I think this was a really cool experiment and that other people should do it because it is a great way to realize what is going on in your head but also to help you put what goes through your mind in words. I realize that the time is up and that I no longer need to be writing but I'm also going to stop because my hands are really hurting. I notice that I almost finished a complete page of writing. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am just not feeling too well today. I know I should not have gone out last night. I did anyway. I told myself that I could easily say ""no"" when asked to go out, but who was I kidding? I knew I would give in at some point. Anyway, I knew I would get sick because everyone else in my dorm has gotten sick. I knew my turn would have to come. I am very distressed right now. I have met so many people in the past ten days, and I cannot remember everyone's names. People tend to remember my name, though. It is easy to remember. Brewer. I would remember that too. That's my name, Brewer. Brewer Baker. Wow, I guess I do kind of like my name! I never can really decide if it's a good name or not, but I think it is ok. ""Ok,"" that's a very complex word; I just learned in my philosophy class about the term ""ok. "" I love my philosophy class; it's really interesting. I am about to go to my freshman seminar, which is entitled, ""Success With Less Stress. "" It's very interesting. I started reading the text yesterday, and it's awesome. It's seemed quite redundant at points, yet interesting overall. I love to write. I have been told that I am a very creative writer. I like that. I like being creative. I think it's interesting to be creative instead of always being precise and conservative. I forgot what I was about to say. I'm glad I can still type with a moderate speed. I would be screwed right now if I were a horrible typist. I am not all that great, but I am fairly quick. I love choosing words to write. I write differently than I speak, though. Sometimes I wish I were able to speak as creatively as I write. I have to admit, though, I do come up with some fun words. Fantabulous. I love that word. Absofuckinglutely. I love that one too. I only say that one on occasion, though. It sounds quite harsh coming from a girl. I try not to cuss a whole lot, but I can't help it sometimes. Like, when I'm around my girlfriends, I tend to cuss a whole lot more than when I'm around guys. I think girls sound trashy when they cuss constantly. I had NEVER said a cuss word in my whole life until I was about fourteen years old! Now, I've gotten a little too comfortable saying them. I even cuss when I'm around my mom, which doesn't make her too happy. She cusses on occasion around me too, though. Wow, I don't know what I'm doing. I met this guy named Cas, and, I think he's a real cutie, but I've also met so many other people in the past weeks, and I like some of them, too. It's weird, thoughI was out last night at this Figi Pledge Line bullshit, and I met some real hotties, but I still thought about Cas; and, I even called him from the party. Weird, huh. I don't think he is the hottest guy, but he has the most awesome personality. I can't stand to talk to a guy, no matter how hot he is, if he doesn't know what to say to me. Cas is right on. He makes me smile and laugh all of the time. I like that. And, he likes me too. That's weird. I mean, not to be braggy, but I do get hit on quite a lot, but some guys obviously just don't like me once they get to know me, which is standard in most cases, but, Cas knows me. I am completely myself around him, and he still likes me. He told me he likes me. I told him that I am mad at myself for liking him  it was funny. I am straight forward with him. It's nice to be that way sometimesyou know, not hide anything. Some things I believe we, as humans with feelings and emotions, should not say  there are things we should keep to ourselves. I believe that we, as humans with feelings and emotions, should share most things. I just clearly contradicted myself, yet it makes since. I know most people think the same way. I am getting tired of typing. I feel drowsy, and my fucking head and throat hurt. I am going to work out anyway, though. I am addicted to working out. I love it and hate it at the same time. I usually dread actually getting up and going, yet I love sweating and the high I get from actually doing it. Ok, I have been writing the standard amount of time now, and I have another class in ten minutes. Bye. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now I'm thinking about the situation I am going through with my two roommates. School has just started and it looks like we will soon be at each others' throats. I really hope we can find a way to not get on each others' nerves because we are such good friends. I'm also thinking about my life and the new frontiers I am beginning to encounter. I can't stop thinking about how the next four years of my life are going to turn out. I hope everything is as great as everyone says it is and has been. I also miss my mom very much. Even though I don't talk to her everyday on the phone, I can hear speaking to me with her heart. The same thing goes for me too. My classes and keeping a responsible daily routine are at the top of my priority list right now. I don't want anything to interfere with me doing an exceptional job in all of my courses. It really is a big change for me being here at a university. Back home school was a breeze. Now I can actually feel that I'm going to have to study, which will be a first for me. The good side to that is that I like challenges. One of my friends from back home, who is really close to me, is planning to move to Florida. There isn't anything wrong with that because he's ""in love"". I hope that he's making the right decision with the move and with her. I really care about him and I wouldn't want him to get hurt in any way. Although, I have a strange feeling that she might be the one for him. Either way he always has a lucky star just waiting to fall on him so that somewhat takes away a bit of my worriness. My other friends who are very close to me are still in my hometown going to school over there. I miss them all the time but I know that me being here is the best thing for me. For some reason I can't stop thinking about a girlfriend of mine who lives in San Antonio because she is attending St. Mary's University. There has always been an unspoken romance between us but we have never actually been together because we have never brought it up, but we know that something is there. "
Tell me about yourself.,"My mind is fried from the test that I just took. Did I do well? Did I screw up?. Did I get tickets to the football game. Jeff was supposed to have a friend draw. I hope our seats are good, because today has been a rough day. I hope Jeff likes me. This writing assignment makes me feel really funny because of all my sporadic thoughts. I wonder if this is one of the papers you decide to read, or if it is just going to end up in some data bank somewhere. I hope psychology is going to be a semi easy course because college at this point is a little overwhelming. My roommate just walked in, so I guess I should mention her. Allison or Ally, whatever I feel like calling her at the time. She fun, makes me laugh, I could use that right now. The test was easy but what if I just screwed up on it because it was my first test. I guess I will know by today what the event will be. The pressure to make good grades is getting to me. I want to have fun and do a little bit of everything, but I don't know how to fit it all in. I want to party with my friends, but I also want to do well. How far will that get me in life. What if I bust my butt and nothing happens. I'm beginning to notice a pattern in my thoughts; they are all questions. Does that mean I'm missing the answers, or does that mean I worry too much. Here I go with the questioning again. I'm trying not to be clichd and do the average, I wonder if so and so likes me, but it is ending up like that. All of my life is in a state of not knowing. For everything that I have learned, it seems like there is much more because everything that I know doesn't answer all of my questions. That's where I get my nosiness, I guess. I classify myself as an ambulance chaser. The time is flying a lot faster than I thought. Scooby Doo is on tv, that is Kaitlyn's favorite show. She's at home in Dallas. I miss her so much and that reminds me that Zach's surgery is going to be tomorrow. He's so little, will he be ok. More questions. They are driving me nuts (feel sorry for the reader). Here's the issue of time again. I'm running out of it, literally and figuratively. I guess its nap time, I don't even know if I want to do that for sure. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well today I feel really stressed since there are so many things to be done for my classes. Like today I had to do this writing assignment to get it out of the way and do my math homework. By the way, I have no idea how to do my math homework which adds on more stress to my life. Anyways this weekend was pretty fun since I went to a retreat for freshman and transfer students. I am a transfer student and I really miss Austin Community College (the college I went to last year). At ACC you get more individual attention and school work is a lot easier than here at the University of Texas. Today I have a class that is three hours long, and since this is the first Monday out of the semester it will be first time going to this class since it only meets on Mondays. Next week will be my first week to start work so I am really looking forward to it but also worried about how much rest I am going to get with school and work. It is my first job so I don't know how I am going to deal with it. Well this psychology class seems kind of scary because half of the time I don't know what the professor means by what he says and personally I am not a real psychology fan. I mean it isn't my favorite subject in the world and it is my first time taking a course dealing with how the mind works and why things are the way they are. I believe that God does everything for a reason so why question what God has done he knows everything. Don't get me wrong it is good to question things, but one is not going to understand everything in this world anyways. For example, if someone is brought up raising chickens in a farm and then goes to a city, that person is going to feel uncomfortable or out of place since he or she has been brought up in a farm. Well they are going to look at everything in a different point of view as if someone who has been living in a city all of their life. Also, people who lived in different countries with different customs and traditions, everyone is different in their own way so what good will it do to question everything since there are different answers for all of us. Another example is that I still don't know what correlation is we talked about it in the Discussion session and think it is some kind of relationship between two things and that is all I know. There are other terms that I am not to familiar with also and I hope I understand them better soon before the test. I really want to get good grades this semester so I don't have to be catching up in future semesters at the University Of Texas. I really don't know that many people here, but I have met a lot of new friends at my church and that has helped me to get used to University life and the moral aspect of what not to do and what is good for me. Well I think that is about all I have to say today, hopefully I will understand the psychology class better as the semester progresses. "
Tell me about yourself.,"4. 57 checking in don't know where to start. I do this a lot though kind of relieves stress like candles and music and flowers haha really girly, huh? oh well, I guess that's me more like a girl on the inside. outside is just comfortable. god, my hair is annoying. it's hot as hell, too thick curly hair doesn't go well with the texas heat I'm writing and all I'm thinking is that if you really do read this, how exactly am I being judged man, this could be an essay about me and my identity and how I interpret myself but that wouldn't let you decide for yourself. and I'm way into that. I want to decide. it can be good, bad, whatever haha it's funny when it's a bad decision, but always an experience my Japan far east competition in volleyball bad time to get caught volleyball captain, a lot of responsibilities damn, I miss volleyball but I don't know if I could survive it definitely something fun to do, but no. rotc takes way too much time hahaha only 24 hours. I remember Korea shoot I didn't even know what it was to sleep unless I was riding in a bus getting somewhere awww away trips those rocked memories. friends. love. trust. heartache. god, I miss Korea. I can't believe I talked to Keith and marry I miss them a lot this college thing is really cool, but dang, nothing compares to serious friendship. I miss my baby damn the fact that he's way younger. it doesn't' matter. I'm tired of everyone's ""idea"" of what is right for me. I loved him for that I can always be myself. whatever that is we'll see. I wonder if I'm going to ""find myself"" here haha this is the place for it, right? ~~bisexuality~~ I mean it's college and all I'm supposed to understand life and myself and who I am and what I'm like this seems more like an email I would send to phillip we were always like this like reading each other's diary in an email. I wonder what he's up to there are a lot of people like that some that I wouldn't mind forgetting about but why? they all touched me in some way haha that sounds sexual I can't believe I admitted to mars before tat or seo or anyone I didn't think I could talk to her like that it takes a lot of guts on both sides for us to have what we have I love her for that I know she feels guilty. we'll see hopefully this will be a lifelong friendship I'm so lucky for that and I thank god for it not like most people: only talk to him when they need something it's funny how religion works it's only prominent in people's lives when they are in need of something then again, I guess that's how a lot of things work I am learning, though not the innocent, little, trusting girl I used to be or at least, not as much haha Korea taught me that I owe my life to that place more the people than the actual place, I guess. more seo than anything I love him I should feel guilty I should actually be censoring my thoughts right about now but, I guess that wouldn't be the assignment. I love ben. I love seo and I would die if I didn't have both of them in my life selfish? I don't know isn't everybody in some way? I think as long as all the people involved accept and are comfortable and happy. happiness is so important. it's funny when people are happy. I don't have to be happy but I couldn't live with myself otherwise so many things play on happiness love. trust. comfort dang, I think I said that before this is something I would send to Mr. clausen I hope his father is okay I would know how hard it would be for him if he wasn't damn. CSM I hope you're watching over me and I know I do some pretty messed up things stuff you wouldn't expect from me but, it's the truth I guess that's a good thing knowing me for who I am maybe it's not all good ben would die if he knew the entire truth can I live with myself knowing I cheated him???? I don't know air force honor code ""I will not lie, steal or cheat or tolerate among us anyone who does"". do I absolutely have to live with that? isn't it, after all, my decision who will know, right? but, no. I couldn't do that the only thing is ben right now my only source of guilt then again, also my soul source of happiness and love and passion and pleasure I hope all that won't turn into regret and pain. god, after rod, I don't know if I can handle that I don't know I would become another American girl I am so not that or at least, I would argue that I'm not whatever. I don't even remember when I started I don't think I'm supposed to be thinking about that maybe this is all wrong. maybe I'm supposed to be doing this word association thing cloud. picnic. ben. love. good thing. sex. passion. seo. lifelong friend, lover, everything I want and need. kind of like my mom except not I don't know should it be words or sentences I think that I think in phrases it's actually harder writing one word at a time whatever. damn, I need a cigarette shit, but I promised 7 today I think I passed that a few hours ago damn smoker's alley. haha is that what it's called. hahaha I feel so unamerican. mars told me I would be hahaha. it's all good: the allAmerican blond ass Keith feels isolated. I'm still okay. it's a good thing. I don't know for how long I'm scared shitless that I'm going to get cancer or something not because I'm going to die shoot, I could care less. I'm happy. I can dies happy. I will die happy. it's just because my mom would die I remember telling her. you know she cried I've never seen her cry only when it somehow deals with me. damn, she loves me god, that is the greatest thing of all knowing that your heart is in the teeth of your creation wow sounds like a JEWEL song I should listen to her very inspiring kind of like talking to people who are passionate about what they do. damn, I love that maybe that's why I'm big into guys who sing and write poetry it's funny, because ben doesn't do either one, and I am so in love with this guy. shit, I don't even want kids, and I would have them for him he knows that I hope it'll last. I figure this is the hardest part. me in college him still in hS I really don't want to deny him a high school social life he's sweet about it I don't know I don't want him to think in years from now ""what if"". you know??? god, I hope not. but I make him happy and he makes me happy and we complete each other hahaa same thing with seo god, this is weird. james doesn't think it'll last. a triangle with me as the main point I don't know shoot, I'm special enough, right? who says I can't have it all that sounds conceited. but I'm not. not if you really got to know me anyway confident? I don't know. more uncertain and scared. reminds me of my identity poem: TYPICAL ECCENTRICITY. whoa it's 5. 20 "
Tell me about yourself.,"My mind is clustered with the nonstop clicking of my roommate's mouse on her computer. It just keeps going and going and going. Then comes the sound of my keyboard keys clicking away. and the sound of my next door neighbor's toilet flushing. I have the sudden urge to tell all the noises to just shut up. I hear the sound of my roommate coughing, and it reminds me of my grandfather, who passed away a few years ago. He died of pneumonia while in a coughing fit. Now I'm thinking about lunch. which I was supposed to have an hour ago. Yet, it is very upsetting because I have no food in the dorm in which I want to eat and the food at the dorms are not quite edible or appetizing. I'm thinking about my boyfriend, and how he'll come visit Austin from Houston this Friday. He'll be coming here to have dinner with me and my roommates at a fancy restaurant. That will be quite exciting considering that I haven't had any great food in a long time. I'm really excited to see him because he lives back at home, where I moved from. This weekend I'll be going to see my parents. When I think of my parents, I get a guilty feeling because I know I haven't been very truthful to them. But, there are just things that I can't tell them because of the generation gap and everything else that occurs between parents and their kids. It makes me feel even guiltier that they miss me and want me to come home, but yet, I don't really miss them yet because I feel restricted in their presence. The sound of water running is making me want to take a shower because it just reminds me of showers. Maybe because I just took a shower. My body feels warm and clean. I love that feeling. The sound of food is calling. but I need to type for another 15 minutes. For some reason. the little eraser shavings on my desk made me think of little insects and bugs. The thought isn't very pleasing considering the fact that I have an extreme hatred for insects. The thought of them makes me itch. Now my eyelids feel heavier and heavier. Writing continuously makes me tired. Speaking of sleepiness, I think of the experiment we did on Monday with the correlation between sleepiness and stress. I was one of the control group people who just sat there. Sitting there listening to all the number counting was like a lullaby. I fell asleep soon after that. Then I woke up to the sound of laughter, and realized that I left a big wet spot on my shirt sleeve because I had fell asleep with my wet hair on my sleeve. It wasn't a great picture because the people walking by might have thought that I drooled all over myself. Not a good image. Speaking of image, I went to rush for a business fraternity yesterday. It felt weird approaching everyone and trying to meet everyone. Usually I am a more inward person and not likely to just go up to people and ""mingle,"" but yesterday I needed to because it was a ""rush"" event. I am thinking that both this fraternity might make me feel more comfortable with meeting people and approaching them, but at the same time. it might not be something I really want to do because I'm not the extremely social type. However, as for now, I will keep on rushing to see how things go. It makes me nervous about joining this fraternity because I know my boyfriend back home will feel somewhat against me hanging around a group of people he doesn't know. It already makes him nervous enough to know that I'm up here at the populated University of Austin, and he's down there back home, in a known environment. So, there are many things to consider about joining these organizations. But like everyone's advice to me: Don't get held down by some longdistance relationship when you get to college. Maybe this is why they gave me the advice. Because every time I go to some party or meet new people, I feel guilty that my boyfriend is not part of it with me. I suppose I get this feeling because he has always been there with me to meet everyone back home. Now that we're in different environments, that is not possible anymore. However, I am still determined to make this relationship work. Now I am really in the mood to go home, and really in the mood to walk up to my refrigerator for some food. One more minute to go. I see Einstein on my computer screen. He makes me want to do well in school. I hope I will do well this year. I feel kind of nervous because there are so many more distractions here, but I suppose I'll learn to handle it. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am feeling anxious about my philosophy class that I have in 40 minutes. the class in which I have not attended yet due to a schedule change. I hope they haven't been assigned a large amount of work yet so that I won't have too much catching up to do. I hope that there isn't going to be an exam on one of the days I'm going to be out of town. I've already had to email professor pennebaker about missing an exam because I will be out of town for my sister's wedding. I wonder what it will be like for my sister after she is married. I hope everything works out for her. I wonder if the person I marry I already know, or if I have yet to meet them. I need to figure out where and how to pay for the classes I added/dropped, I need to do this soon. I hope that when I have to connect flights in st. louis it all goes well and is easy, since I've never had to connect before. it will be worth it though because I'll get to see my sister who I haven't seen in a very long time. I need to go to the rowing meeting tonight, but I'm afraid if I commit to it I won't have enough time to study. also, I'm going to miss 5 days of tryouts because I'll be out of town. it sure seems like going out of town is causing me to miss a lot of things, but my sister is important to me and being a part of her wedding will be very special. I need to go do some reading for my rhetoric class before I have to leave for philosophy. I hope I like this class, or else I switched out of sociology for nothing. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Wow. what an assignment. I think this has got to be one of the easiest grades I have ever made. I am feeling a bit like Doogie Howser (at the end of each episode, it is night and he normally sits at his computer and types his journals out and reflects upon the events that happened throughout the day). I am typing this in Microsoft word, because it was recommended by your little site and was repeated about 4 times. Although I have Physics tomorrow, which I have no clue what is going on in because my teacher is a bit confused himself. I am feeling relieved because I had this HUGE paper due in my freshman seminar class today and I worked my ass off for it and I feel good about it. I am not all that great of a writer but I think I will get a decent grade on it. Plus it was only a first draft, and we will have to go back and revise them and whatnot. By the time I am completely finished with the paper I am going to despise it but hey, that is how it goes, I suppose. I think it is good for a person to just sit and write or type every once and a while. I have a friend, Olga, who has gone through like 12 journals in the past 3 years. She tries to find time for it everyday. it is her relaxation and when she is really upset or depressed, once she gets everything out. she feels better. Which reminds me, I need to give her a call. I miss her. She goes to Southwest Texas. I am actually sitting on the phone with my boyfriend who is also in the class (Michael Linford). We are both typing this writing assignment at the same time. Well. I thought it was a bit humorous. I am actually in a really good mood, because my boyfriend and I actually live in the same city now. It is a really good feeling. We met last year, here in Austin at debate camp. He is from Colleyville (DallasFort Worth), so we spent just under a year living 4 hours apart from each other. All of my classes are going pretty good, although I still don't really have a clue what I want to major in just yet. I am in the college of Liberal Arts (woo hoo!) and I was thinking about a double major in psychology and government. I also want to go to law school. I seriously doubt I will get into UT's law school. It is way too competitive. * Sigh * who knows, I sure don't. I am living at Dobie right now, and let me tell youI am getting ripped off. It is $7000 a year and I have a little room and have to walked up stairs all the time because I live on the 2nd floor (the ""intensive study floor""), which I never signed up to be in. I guess it isn't all that bad though; at least I'm not at Jester. I don't have a car here because my parents are irrational. I have a car sitting in the garage at home but they didn't want me to bring it with me because they thought it would be some sort of a ""growing experience"" for me. Although I only live around an hour or so away from here (Schertz, TX. near San Antonio) I haven't been home since I have been here. I have no real desire to go home. I hated high school, well I hated it my senior year. All my friends graduated and my classes were a waste of time. I guess that is one of the reasons why I feel I can't compete with some of the people here at UT, my high school didn't have much to offer. I have a good friend of mine (Shala) that came and saw me the weekend before last. She is at UNT and she hates it there. Although I miss her, I think she misses me a whole hell of a lot more. She has resorted to hanging out with people from our high school that didn't give her the time of day for the last 6 years of her life. Jocks and whatnot. Supposedly there is this annoying kid (who I started to resent in high schoolScott Hall) that talks to her nonstop about me. Scott and I were buds back in 8th grade and once we got to high school, I no longer existed. That happened with a lot of my jr. high friends. Back to Shala, well she told me yesterday that she has ""found God. "" If only you knew Shala, you would know that is a load of shit. If she is happy, then hey I am all for it, but I don't think it is something she'll stick with. I am not an atheist or anything but I just don't know and don't care to find out. I am not saying I won't be open to opinions and respectful of one's commitment and dedication but it is something that annoys me. I guess that is because of my parents. They use to force me to go to church, and my dad wouldn't let me go out or do anything on Sundays unless I went (even though he would sit at home, watching football or somethinghypocrite!) Alright. I have far surpassed the 20minute limit and I'm out. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, I'm at UT now, and boy, is it a different life. Everything is different now; no more mom's home cooked meals and I have to do my laundry now. I'm going to go back every two weeks and take my laundry home. I will only need two weeks' worth of clothes and then I can take it all home and get them washed. One main thing I like about UT are women! Wow, there are some sexy women here. Then again, there are also the ugly girls. They will always be around, but at UT, the ratio of hot to ugly girls is much better than what I have seen before; at least that's what it seems like. I guess women are the motivation to stay here in school. I could never go to an allboys school. I would go crazy! There would be nothing to look forward to. Talking about women, I went back home last weekend and I met my very good friend, Stephanie. We have been friends for years, but only recently have we gotten really good friends. For example, she took me out for dinner and a movie before I had to leave for college, and she has been telling me how much she will miss me. I think ever since I broke up with my old girlfriend, Stephanie has gotten closer to me. I am definitely happy about it. She is the sweetest girl I know, and she looks great too. I've been emailing her quite often and I plan to visit her every time I go home. College relationships can be hard when the person you like lives far away. The main reason my relationship with my last girlfriend ended was because of college. She mainly did not want to go through a longdistance relationship, and I agree with her. However, I have known Stephanie for way too long, and there is no way that I can simply ignore her. Well, I'm not sure what to talk about now. I'm in my room and I really do not want to do this psychology assignment. My friend just called me and he asked me to play a computer game with him. I really want to play, but I still have to type what is on my mind. I am going to talk some more about Stephanie. I guess, she is the main thing that is on my mind. I cannot stop thinking about her. Her high school homecoming is coming up this October, and I think I will tell her that she can go with me if she has no one else in mind. After all, we went together last year. I am pretty sure that she knows that I have a crush on her. Especially since I gave her a kiss on the cheek two nights ago. I was surprised when she asked me to come over and watch a movie with her. She looked terrific that night; I'm pretty sure she wanted to look good for me. Either way, we had a good time and I made her laugh several times. I think it is really important to keep a girl happy in order to have a healthy relationship. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am the egg man whoo I am the egg man whoo i am the walrus coo coo cachoopp? and that girl with the intriguing eyes looked through my spectacles and I could sense her ability to discern my anxiety. she knew she was pretty, and my sudden glance away from her, told her exactly what I was thinking. just from one moment, a bug's seconds glance, I was ashamed. as if I had stumbled upon a lady, naked or something horrible that would define my clumsiness of timing. but its all the same if you don't mind dear reader. I'm just a bit antsy, anxious, looking for colors undiscovered of nature yet. I am positive God has a predestined pastel palette that he has not yet utilized. I mean who knows? with all the toxins in the air, it makes one wonder who is the greater painter of a sky or landscape, man or God? so my friend and I are walking in a park and I said, ""wow what pink skies, I am so amazed at the beauty that surrounds me at this moment, I mean its all celestial, you know all of it """"hey, want me to burst your bubble,?"" she says. ""I know I'm going to regret this, but yeah tell me why!,"" I said. ""its because of pollution. the gases in the air. "" and then everything drowned in the void of her gibberish, hogwash, drivel, and my subconscious began to speak for her almost. I wanted to believe that it was something supernatural. something that was not polluted or tainted by the industry of man's ambition and stuff. ""no"" I said. ""that's not true,"" I rebutted. ""because if you look at the painters of 18th century romanticism, you notice the Delacroix pinks and blues of paint in the skies. or Turner's exaggerated oranges and stuff ""she didn't know what I meant, and I don't think I was talking much sense either. but those faded or bleached greens never leave do they? the trees, like that of an oil painting. its all too much it seems for some, I guess even me. they, those greens, speak of nature's affinity with the species it serves, and the congruence of it all. I think that if she, my friend, would have told Vincent van Gogh that same monstrous factoid she had told me, I could probably imagine him in a self portrait without any ears at all. coo coo cachoop? that damn Beatles tune. "
Tell me about yourself.,"It is the first time that I have done this and I don't think it is at easy as it sounds. For though there are no mathematical equations to solve I do think it is pretty hard to keep on writing without stopping for such a great amount of time (20 minutes is a lot of time) I don't really know what to keep on writing, since right now I am just worried about the fact that this are going to be the longest 20 minutes of my life. I have just received and email of my cousin and I'm so glad because she is now working and it makes me think how great it would be for me to get a job, since today I went again, to speak to the person in charge in the cactus caf and no one was there, and the girl told be that there were no open jobs and specially not at the time that I need. I really want to work because I don't want to spend more money given to me by my parents since I'm fully aware that they need it for things far more important that what I am using the money for (clothes, food, personal expenses in general. When the eternal 20 minutes go by I shall reply to my cousins email and express to her the great gratitude I feel towards her email since at the present time she has been one of the only people in my family, which have supported us in this time of nee. This is really hard for me because I feel like I'm writing like a two year old since this isn't my native language. It would be so much more comfortable if I could write in my language, since when my mind is working it is usually processing information in English. Right now the phone is ringing and I guess this is Jorge since he said he was going to call. I really hope its not anyone from home for I would be really disappointed and sad if they called and me being here did not pick up the phone just because I am doing this stupid homework which at the time seems pretty irrelevant, to what I am feeling at the present time. I am just repeating myself and a set of common American expressions that come to my mind, this is pretty stressing because I want to look at the monitor and check out how much have I written and specially I want to check out the timer. for I have taken a cooking timer to control my minutes typing so that I wouldn't have to stop to watch the clock. While typing other thoughts go past my mind but they are probably in Spanish and I am probably just ignoring them so that I don't make typos, this makes me think of my stupid physics teacher, I'm so glad I don't have to take any more physics in my whole life. I don't really know what I want to study, each time I go to the introduction to psychology class my mind plays tricks on me and I start visualizing myself in various occupations and I'm not quite sure of which one truly fits me. I couldn't resist so I took a look at the timer and I just realized that only ten minutes have passed and they have passed so slowly, its like when you are up at night not being able to sleep and scared of the dark and listening to the clicking of the clock and time just passes so slowly. Well I would just like to get it over with since I am basically trashing 20 minutes in front of this computer not doing any real thinking or insight process but just mechanically typing and typing and typing and when I make a mistake I just press the backspace and keep on going. Well since I don't know what else to say I'll keep on exploring my thoughts related to my future and my career. I think a really important issue is due to me, going to this jerk astronomer who separated my life into two: before and after I went. I am really worried of what he said dealing with marriage and divorce, it has always been a fear I have had and that day he just said it to me as if nothing was the matter. And of course something is the matter because once they tell you something like that you won't be able to forget it ever. Also what he said about me having problems with my baby like miscarriages or stuff well I think he shouldn't have said that either. I wish I could have entered the business school since I would be having a respectable title of a carrier but since I didn't then I just en up having all these classes, which I really enjoy but which are making me feel more confused. I really like the university and the classes and the teachers, but I haven't made many friends and although I know it has nothing to do with my self worth I do feel a little upset because I have been hirer for over three weeks and still I don't feel like I have a lot of friends. I just took a look at the watch and I think this is finally it! "
Tell me about yourself.,"This is the first writing assignment I have had in college. I'm a little nervous. I don't know why I should be worried about this because at least this writing assignment is an interesting one. I've never written in a stream of consciousness. I just lost my train of thought. I tend to do that. Actually, I constantly go off on these tangents as I hold any conversation. It's quite annoying. But hey, it's me. It's about to rain outside. I was just telling a friend about how hilarious it was that everyone noticed that it was raining when one student left early during class yesterday. And Professor Pennebaker was totally right when he said noone was paying attention anymore to what he was saying because we were all thinking, ""How the hell am I going to get home now?"". I laughed for a long time after that, but I was still thinking about the rain. After I ran out of class I noticed a lot of people were prepared, and had their umbrellas with them. I also noticed that the people with these umbrellas who were walking with someone else without an umbrella, did not share their umbrella with the other person. Not one of them. I thought that was extremely odd. I have never used the word umbrella so many times in one sentence. I'm very sleepy now. The rain tends to have that effect on me. I love the rain, not just for that reason but it's also soothing. But I do hate when it rains right before, or when I am about to go out. It's a hassle that I haven't had to deal with for a long time. I'm thinking we are in the middle of a drought. I can't wait until winter either. That time of year makes me happy. I don't know why I keep referring to weather. I'm not one of those, ""It's lovely weather we are having today"", kind of person. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I have to my homework. I have to study for my chemistry and history. I have to go to Houston this Thursday, so I wont attend class. I have so much shit to do. my mind is going blank right now. oh yeah. I have to go home and clean the dishes, wash my clothes, wake up at 9:00am, get ready and because of my homework I will not be able to go to sleep until 12:00. Tomorrow first thing in the morning, I have to pay my tuition bill of 4 dollars, go to the bookstore and buy my precal book and psy. book. right after I type this I have to go to HEB and do some grocery shopping. since I have no food at home I will buy milk, cereal, junk food, chips, pizza, juice, Gatorade, water, bathroom, paper, tilex mildew stain remover. this is hurting my neck. it really hurts. I need to go home and go to sleep I will be so happy after I get this assignment done; I will be done with at least one of my homework for school. I feel so tired right now; I just want to go home and go to sleep. I cannot stand being here [library] any longer than I have to. "
Tell me about yourself.,Right now I am wondering how can I fit into college. I am wondering what is it that makes people think different than other people. Why is it that some people can do their homework right when they get it and other people procrastinate until the very last minute. Now my mind is totally blank. I am wondering why I cannot connect my thoughts to reach a conclusion. I am I going to be judged by how I write this. Does this accurately reflect my intelligence level. Again I am stopped by the nothingness that I am thinking. Its as if at one moment I am this intelligent individual and the next I am this ignorant fool that cannot manage to continuously write for twenty minutes. As I sit in my dorm writing this I am wondering whether or not I could be doing something else more fun. It is quite lonely in this room. For the most part I think what would solve a lot of my problems is a girlfriend. Someone to talk to that will fill this uncertainty of who I am. For the most part I have never been in love with a girl. What I want is exactly the opposite. I am ready for a relationship. Now instead of going on about this I am reflecting on what I just said. I am thinking is there something wrong with me because all the things seem so negative. But there are also very good things also. I think about how lucky I am to get such a great education from this university. I realize that not many people have this chance. I hope to really discover who I am in the next four years. I think that maybe the reason I have been writing all these negative things is because I am sick. I have a really bad cold and maybe it is effecting the way I think. Ok on to a different topic. I was just watching the road rules on MTV and they were talking about how your childhood effects you later in life. I think this is the perfect case with me. In my family we never really showed any emotions. Not once have I ever told my mom that I love her. Maybe that is the reason it is so hard for me to get into a good relationship. I feel that my relationship with my parents is exactly like my relationship with anybody else that I have been close to. I don't really open my self up to anybody. All my emotions are behind a wall of shyness. My mom always said that I was shy. Maybe she negatively reinforced why I am so shy. But enough about that. I was just thinking about an amazing experience that I had with my dad last week. I was in my parent's room playing guitar. My dad comes in and starts playing along with me. My dad and I don't really do many things together so this was one of the most emotional experiences in my life. I was happier than ever before. My dad took the time to show me some new tricks on the guitar as I played along with him. It was such an amazing experience. Well I think that I have run out of time. 
Tell me about yourself.,"My thoughts and feelings at the moment reflect several important aspects of my life. Perhaps, one of the most recurring thoughts has been my progress with my academic success. I am worried and concerned with maintaining an above average status as a student. One other concern of mine relates to my commitment toward studying and learning. I fear that I will not be able to put enough effort into accomplishing my tasks in school and at home. Thus, most of the time I reflect on future and find myself greatly concerned and worried. I feel in great anguish and perhaps, turmoil. I am also very concerned about the financial needs and requirements of college. Often, I feel that college has placed a great burden both financially and emotionally on my parents. This, in turn, causes much sadness for me. Although the social aspect of my life, at the moment, is not a significant matter, I still find myself looking back at the days in high school and at the friends that I left behind. I comprehend the fact that any transition in life accompanies great distress and agitation. However, I find myself more weary and temperamental than distressed or melancholy. At times, I feel as though I have not slept for days. I feel constantly fatigued. I have always realized that I worry to a great degree; and at times that my lifestyle has dramatically changed, this aspect of my personality has in turn worsened. I see myself literally concerned about every trivial matter in life. I worry a lot about my weight issues. Lately, I have noticed a dramatic change in my eating habits. Through the past year, I was able to lose a great amount of weight and maintain it. I was also able to control what I ate in addition to exercising a great deal. However, lately I have deviated from this habitual behavior. I have gained about 10 pounds. I feel greatly out of control. I do not even have the motivation to exercise. Often, I wake up in the morning and find myself critically loathing every aspect of my appearance. At school, I often compare myself with other females and feel greatly embarrassed. My parents and my acquaintances have at times mentioned that I look better now that I am not so underweight. However, I do not perceive or comprehend their point of view. As a result, I promise myself almost every day to lose all the unnecessary weight that I have gained. I even plan a strict diet for the next weeks. However, I never follow through the plan. Although this recurring thought is truly trivial in comparison with matters concerning my education, I still cannot rid myself of the compulsive need to restrict my diet and control my eating habit. I believe that there is great tension in my life at the moment. Perhaps, this is true for a lot of students that have began their first year of college experience. Regardless of my emotional well being at the time, I still seek hope and remedy in studying and experiencing all the knowledge that college has to offer. I am sure that if I put enough effort into my academic advancement I will easily succeed in future. Nevertheless, I truly wish that I could annihilate the worries that accompany me day and night. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am so stressed out right now with all these school stuff. Today I was so frustrated with my course schedule because I needed a fine arts credit. At the beginning, I signed up for art history, but I just found out that the class didn't work out for me. I didn't want something that hard to deal with since I am not even majoring in art. Therefore, I decided to try the music department. I called in, and the lady who worked at the office told me that the music appreciation class was still opened. She told me to go all the way to the building MRH just to fill out the green card in order to add the class. So, I decided to drop my art history class right away. In the afternoon, I rushed over there. By the time when I got there, one of the lady told me that I needed to talk to the professor first before I could fill out the green card. Plus, the time of the class she offered me interfered with my original schedule. I was so upset about this when I left the building because I really needed one more class in order to be fill up my hours. When I got back to my dorm, I immediately called my college of education for help. The guy told me to go to see the advisors in the next morning. He also told me not to worry too much today about it. I knew I shouldn't drop my art history class that quickly. I should have waited to see if I could be added to another class. Right now, I consider to take piano as my fine arts credit during the next semester because I have a little knowledge with piano but I am required to sign up on the waiting list first. The class can only fill up 15 students. Instead of taking the fine art class in this semester, I decided to take chinese instead. Besides, I need a foreign language credit. Tomorrow I will need to see that professor to see if I am allowed to be in that class. Hopefully, I can. I have been worried about this over the whole day. I wish everything can work out fine tomorrow. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now I am feeling good because today is Friday. So far I have really enjoyed my first week of school. I like all my classes so far, and I am embracing the whole college experience. I am also happy because I am going home to Houston today. It has only been a week since I left but I already miss my house and especially my parents. Right actually I do not have anything on my mind. I am pretty tired because I slept late last night and had a fairly early class. In fact, right now sleep would be really good. Well my stomach is also talking to me so I am also hungry. I have not eaten yet today. I am actually eating less in college since I seem to be always busy and always on the run. I like it though because maybe then I can lose some weight. Another thing in my mind is how complicated computers are. I never was really into computers in high school and now in college I have to constantly use it. I wish I was better with computers because I really think it is useful and is part of everybody's daily lives. I think the reason why I do not care for the computer much is because due to my impatience. I cannot really tolerate having to go in circles to find what I really want. For example this assignment would already have been done last night but for some reason I could not get into the website. However, I am glad I am finally able to finish my work after several tries late last night. I think it is quite interesting how a lot can be said about a person through their writing because right now it seems that I am rambling and to be honest I do not think that there's anything logical in my head right now. I am not really thinking about anything but what to write for this assignment, if that made any sense. My brain is just telling me to think of something to write. Actually I am also anticipating for the time to be up. Twenty minutes can be long when you do not have much to say. Speaking of waiting for the time to pass by, it has been twenty minutes. I am finally done. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, I'm not really sure what to write here, but here goes. So, I'm in a new state, in a new place, with no one here that I knew before I arrived. Sounds kind of scary, but I'm dealing. I came to texas from Nashville, TN. And it really seems that I am one of the few that are from out of state. Everyone is from Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, or Austin. And it has been rough, because most people came here with all of their best friends and here I am, this outsider who knows no one. But I was excited anyway, because I loved the school and all the school spirit. I came here early, because I was going to go through rush. Unfortunately about a month before I left for school, I was diagnosed with mono. I had been feeling okay, but started feeling bad right before I left for school. I had to skip the open house round of rush because I felt so bad. I participated in the rest and actually pledged the one that I wanted, but it was one of the hardest experiences. I had to be perky and cute when it was 100 degrees outside and when I felt horrible. I got through it and now I feel much better, but I will always remember that! Now that I am in the sororityI definitely like it but it is still hard. All the girls live in a different dorm than I do, and 26 out of 60 of them are all from the same high school in Houston! It's crazy. They are all really nice, but it is hard to make friends with people who already have all of their best friends here. I, so far, like the older girls better than my pledge class. We have our retreat next weekend, so hopefully I will get to know them better after the retreat. Classes are going well, but I'm struggling with the huge ones, because they are bigger than my entire high school! I only graduated with 80 people, so it is very different here. It is hard to know everything that goes on on campus, because everyone else already knows what and where everything is and I have no idea! Anyway, all this sounds like I am not having fun and that is absolutely not true! I LOVE school, but it has been so hard to force myself to stay home to get rid of the mono when all I want to do is go out, meet new people, and have fun! I do miss home a lot. I have always been very close to my family, especially my little sister and my mom (and my little dog Missy) So I miss them all a whole lot, but I am dealing. I have made some great friends in my dorm and I like all my professors and the people in my classes. I am looking forward to going home for Thanksgiving to see all my friends, but I am also looking forward to a lot of fun before then. Okay, I think it has been about 20 minutes, so I am going to leave now. So long, professor, even though you aren't reading this! :) Bye "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well another night of staying up late. I don't know why I don't really want to go to bed. I guess I just don't feel like it or I feel like I have to do something before I go to bed, but then something else pops up. I think I got used to not sleeping during my time in the Army. Kind of fun back then. The Army usually pops in my head late at night when I'm on the computer because that's what I did in the Army. I can tune everything out and just have the humming of the computer and only the light from the screen providing light for the room. Reminds me of sitting in the track at 3 or 4am shooting missions. I wonder where I would be if I would have stayed in. I bet I would have gone to Korea for a year then back to Fort Sill. I wish I would have gone to Korea as soon as I got out of AIT. Those guys came back better trained than the guys who stayed in the States. I probably could have used that year being away from everybody. I hope it doesn't rain tomorrow. Man I hate the rain. I remember in Virginia I missed all the rainy days at school. I guess I got lucky it only seemed to rain on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I miss Virginia. The leaves, the snow, the mountains and the lake right behind the apartment. Man, everyday there was football weather. I can't believe they lost to BYU last week. Man I hate BYU. "
Tell me about yourself.,"You know I always wonder if I'm ever doing the right thing in life by coming to this university and not going somewhere else. I had opportunities to go to other universities but I chose to stay close to home. My parents always want it there way! They basically chose my major for me and when I wanted to change it, they became upset and really didn't want to see my face which made me upset. I want to do what my parents tell me to do but if it does not interest me and I know I'm going to stress over it, why should I bother to listen and I went with what I felt was best for me and I made the change. I always wonder how some people are so intelligent and others try so much but can't reach the level of that intelligent person based on academics. I see people trying so hard to make that A in that one class where the intelligent person doesn't take one ounce of effort to even study and this person would make a higher grade on the exam then the person who tried so hard to learn the material and study so hard on the exam. One thing which confuses me is how girls think. They're like in their own world sometimes. You try to be so nice to them sometimes and they look at you like you're the biggest IDIOT! I wish they would open up more around guys and not just talk with their girlfriends all the time. They should be able to tell their guy friends anything they tell their girlfriends. Why do the Astros suck so bad this year? They had a perfect baseball team and they're playing like a bunch of high school boys. They were recognized as favorites this season and they're ranked last in the division. They're is no excuse for being so mad especially a team so talented like the Astros. I mean if you had Bagwell, Biggio, Alou, Caminitti and other stars, wouldn't you expect your team to be good?? The rockets need to do better next year also. I can't believe they didn't pick up any free agents this summer. They could have really improved this year with all the talented free agents and they made the mistake of not picking up anyone. If they want to be really good again, they're going to have to pick up some talented free agents or they're not going anywhere and even in danger of not making the playoffs. I don't know why some teachers just don't tell us what will be on the exam. It would be so much easier to study the material but NO, they make us study everything even the non important information which really pisses of students, especially me. One thing I really love in the University are the girls. They are so damn hot! Only if I could have one of them would I show them what kind of man I really am! Its ok, one day, I will find the right one. "

"
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm sitting all stressed out. For the first time since if got to UT I've had to study and do homework for a large period of time. I guess for the first time since I've gotten here I'm starting to realize how much work its going to take. The fraternity stage is getting old. They don't tell you that you are going to be busy about everyday of the week doing sometimes pointless stuff. I'm new to the fraternity scene and already I'm feeling somewhat burned out. And paying a lot of money to clean the frat bathrooms isn't my idea of fun anyway. Even drinking is getting old. Its almost to the point that you can expect to get messed up every night and that takes the fun out of the whole thing. I don't like admitting this to myself but it would be nice to see someone from the family right now. I'm not homesick just kind of feel like I'm missing out on everything that's going on in my brothers and parents life. It's hard to deal with the fact that the family life is never going to be the same again which is somewhat of a relief but also a little scary. At least I am enjoying living with my roommates. They were my friends before I came here but I am a bit surprised to how good we are getting along. With my friend dying last week I found myself today thinking I saw him in other people. The reality of death has hardly set in on me. His picture of him alive is hanging right in front of me, but its hard to comprehend there is no more life in him. I almost feel like all my experiences with him were pointless because he is dead. Even seeing him in an open casket I failed to connect him laying there to his death. I attribute this to the fact that this is the first person in my life that I was close to that has died. It's weird but it will help me in the future to deal with the harshness of death. More than ever I think along the lines of life after death. I'm firm in my beliefs regarding the subject but I somewhat question what its really like. I guess you never take death seriously until it effects you on the personal level. I hear of people dying everyday but it has never registered to me how important everyone's life his to someone else out there. And above all I guess the possibility of death seems more likely. I feel less likely to put myself in situations where my life is on the line. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Ah, this is frustrating. Seems like I have lost the touch. After all, college is nothing like high school. I'm a mess; I can't pick the beat. Somehow, I've fallen behind in my life. Pretty much I got to do everything on my own, whereas it used to be people telling me what to do and when to do anything. There was always someone, could be the teacher or mom, constantly laying out the path I should take. Now, it's all up to me now. No one can really help. It's my life. Is this how adulthood feels like? Perhaps, that's just simply a childish question, silly. I can't see what's in front of me, just a big blur, a bit gray. Once again, I want to stay as a kid. Couple of years ago, our English teacher asked us to write a little journal, ""What age would you stay at, if you get to choose?"" Back then, I thought, ""Hey, I am going to go through every phase. That's the experience of life; that's the fun. "" Now, it doesn't feel so fun. Aw, sitting alone in a class of 500 people doesn't seem fun to me. It's funny that I don't have much people to talk to in real life, but there are people online wanting to chat with me, all those high school friends. Somehow they managed to stay 24 hours and 7 days online without much difficulty. I talked to one of them last night, just to keep me awake while I tried to figure my calculus homework. He is quite sociable; I suppose. That reminds me my close friend once called me an antisocialist. Not that I don't want to interact with people. It's just that they weren't the exact right people I want to share my inner self with. And again, I've only found one person I share almost all my thoughts with. I remember in elementary school, I used to walk home with my best friend. We wouldn't feel awkward or funny even if we didn't talk or make some noise on the way home. It felt secured. But ever since we moved to US, everything changed. No one here holds the same principle I do; I couldn't outpour what I think inside to those people who think my thinking is so odd, and supposedly weird. I still talked to everyone who wanted to chat with me; I just tell them what I really think inside. I made general comments about whatever they said. This close friend who called me an antisocialist actually talked to me on the phone for almost every night for a couple of years. Even he called me that. I suppose he never reached inside of me; my best friend thinks I talk too much. Funny how both talk to me the equal amount, but they hold the opposite views of me. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Where do I start? It's funny how when you are actually telling yourself that you need to think of something that things like pink bunny rabbits come to mind. Why? Right now, I'm trying to reorganize my mp3 collection. I thought that if I added a few new categories like 80s, 90s, country, comedy, etc. , that it would be easier to find what I'm looking for when there is something particular I want to hear. I'm usually in an upbeat mood, especially when I have something to do (like school), so I like to listen to upbeat music. But there are times when only slow music like U2's ""Achtung Baby"" album, or other slower music from the 80s. When I like to listen to these slow songs, it's not like I'm in a depressed mood or anything, it's just that I'm thinking about something intensely personal, I guess. I know that when I was breaking up with my last girlfriend, I listened to this music a great deal. It also helps me to be creative. I have a tendency to write things like poems or short stories when I'm in that mood. So, question. Do I have to have a thoughtful demeanor in order to listen to the slow songs, or does listening to that particular kind of music put my mind into a creative thinking mode? Grin and Bear It. I'm a little intimidated by the amount of students I've come into contact with at this university. 50,000 people crammed into a fairly confined land space can make one feel claustrophobic. I like it, though, because everyone here is my age. There is an endless supply of new friends, new faces, new experiences, new situations. I could say that it's advantage of being so big is also a disadvantage. I've been to my Psychology and English classes a couple of times and have yet to see the same face twice in each. I don't know anyone in this city, so it makes adjustment a little hard. My family has moved around quite a bit, so it's not that I'm not used to being new to something, I just wished I had my best friend here to share it with. Andy. Big guy. Sings. Just like me. Likes the same music. Likes the same movies. Likes the same people I do, except when it comes to women. He disapproves of a great deal of my girlfriends. The few that he does like, I seem to like more, too. Strange, though, how those are the ones that move away or want to see other people. I'm hot. My air conditioner hasn't been working these past few days and the apartment people say that they're ""on it. "" Whatever. Some tenants left a note on the manager's office door (the manager has conveniently not been in, either), saying some pretty mean stuff. I think it's funny, but at the same time I try to put myself in the shoes of the manager. She has many things to think about, I'm sure, but still. 110 on the thermometer is no laughing matter, especially for someone who's not from around here. Not used to the heat. My bike needs to be adjusted. It doesn't shift gears the way it should. Up shifting seems to work fine, but when I down shift, the chain doesn't move crisply. I need to find a new seat, too. Maybe one with a little more padding. I hope the interview with Compaq goes well. Not only is it a big company that would give me lots of opportunities, but George Lucas. I want to work for George Lucas. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Last Saturday, my parents sold the house that I have lived in my entire life. Even though it has been on the market for over a year, I was very upset. It seems to me as though my family is falling apart. I have three siblings, and we are all located in different cities and have our own homes in these cities. And since the place that my parents are moving to doesn't have rooms for us, where I am right now is my home now. Where my brothers and sister live is their home now, and it doesn't feel like we are a family anymore. Because the definition of a family is someone who lives together basically. Even if we wanted to stay in the same place in my hometown, Amarillo, we couldn't. There are six of us in my family, and my parents only have one extra bedroom. My sister only has one extra bedroom, so half of us are going to have to stay at her house and half at my parent's when we are in Amarillo. It's so weird. I don't even know what I'm going to do when I drive past the house. I'll probably pull into the driveway not thinking. I do things like that all the time. Without thinking, one day, I drove to my best friend's house because I was thinking of her, and she wasn't even in town. I just have to look on the positive side of this move and remember that it is what my parents want. They are so excited about simplifying their lives, but it is just hard to know that we will never be that family again under one roof. My family is the most important thing in my life, and I don't want that to change. I guess my biggest fear is having the relationships that my parents have with their siblings. They were close friends with their siblings, and now they barely talk to each other. Now that my siblings and I are beginning to make families of our own, I don't want to lose any part of the relationship that we have now. I've gone through life making friends and growing apart, and it has been really hard on me, but my family has always been there. Without that solid relationship, I don't know how life is going to be. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Start. the question is how can I make a good grade in this class? most people are smarter than me so I have to try harder to make a better grade. I know nothing, that is all I know. I don't know what to say when I see a stranger so I do not speak. frustrated. confused. tired. lucky. healthy. homesick. lonely. but its all good ill be alright tomorrow right? fuck you big country you bitch. there are so many new people here its overwhelming. I am mute. I want to make friends but I do nothing. stupid. harmless. harmful. nice. relaxed. worked out. bored. nothing really to say to mom and dad just what I did today. can't talk about some of the other things because there is no need for them to be burdened by my troubles. but they would like to hear it anyways. maybe I will try talking to them. am I crazy? I hope so. its so much more fun to be crazy. like in catch22, which I just finished reading. its really interesting to mess with people the way yosarrian did. I miss paris. I love it and hate it but love it more than hate. everyone is connected to everything else. especially in paris. I don't know anything right? because I am from paris? I'm so sick and tired of people from Houston, Dallas, Austin, san Antonio trying to make me feel inferior and they know everything so much better than I do. but I come from a small town and know I know nothing. who is smarter now? I love the country. there is nothing like it. big city people are pop people. they are so one way and not another. all the cheerleaders dress like brittney, all the guys dress like Backstreet boys or some rapper from the east coast they wish they could be like. in the country its all different. anything goes believe it or not. everyone listens to everything. everyone can dress however the hell they want to on any day and no one think differently. that's another thing that confuses me. I'm from the country and I listen to all kinds of music. everyone I meet is pretty much into one thing and thinks the other stuff is lesser quality until I put some stuff on and they say oh I like that now. but they know more than me. jester is like Westgate. drugs are everywhere and easily obtained. you just got to know who to ask. I'm glad I ain't into that. I stick with some beer myself. its funny how beer is harder to get than drugs here and everywhere I've been. the government has their focus on the wrong areas. I don't know much about government because it was so boring to me in high school. I may not even vote in this election because I don't see a real point in it. someone else has narrowed down my options so evidently they got that far they can do the rest. I miss brother sid. it hurt me when I found out he had passed on but I didn't cry. I really liked listening to him speak in church. he had a real way with words and was very emotional. our new preacher is a lot different as was to be accepted but its still not the same. he tries to make things to complicated and show his intelligence when everyone knows you are suppose to preach on a 3rd grade level. but why is that? that's like saying hey you wont get very far in your spiritual education if you never get higher that the third grade. third grade was when I broke my ankle outside running and some black girls started laughing at me. I stayed in school the rest of the day and was tough you know, trying to act tough. I didn't cry the next year either when I really messed it up jumping on a trampoline. I cried when I couldn't play baseball though. that was when I was good at baseball. before I wanted to quit so bad and cried while I was playing. of course I had a lot of shit going on in my life then. adolescence can be a bitch. but I was lucky enough to make it through it and once I got out of my depression I haven't really been in one since. I get sad a lot and have notorious mood swings but nothing major. rosanne is a huge influence in my life. i've never heard anyone else say that. she's has a totally different approach to life. laugh at yourself in the mirror every morning. make fun of yourself before others do so they know it doesn't really bother you and they wont make fun of you for whatever. water. drink. wet. still thirsty after every drink. don't know why that is. can't get the taste of chips out of my mouth right now. taste always makes me hungry. but i've already ate so there is no need to now that I am full and don't need to eat. I wonder what lindsey is doing right now? I think I have figured her out. she likes to tell people what she thinks will sound good and never lives up to anything she tells me. but she's my friend still. my friends in paris have all moved away. I wonder what andrew is doing in Arkansas right now. he just moved the other day I think cause of crazy ass aliece. she gets weirder and weirder everyday. like stevens roommate russell. that boy is strange. he thinks he is Mr. badass and knows everything. I wonder if he knows he's a spaz. he said my car system sounded like shit. he's listened to good systems and mine is shit. first time anyone has ever told me that before. maybe its true but still I don't even know they guy that well and he's only heard one time but he knows. I'm stupid. my arms hurt. they need to be stretched. I wonder how long i've written for. my roommate likes to play videogames and turn the sound up loud. have some respect man. I don't do stuff like that to him. I'm glad everyone isn't like me. then id feel different. have you ever thought of life as a cartoon or wished you could do stuff in cartoons? it makes it much more interesting. it also makes me more creative I think. or crazier. but I like doing it anyways. I haven't had a square in 4 days now. haven't had a beer since i've been here. maybe I will but I don't really miss it. they were wrong when they said I couldn't have fun without beer. what were they thinking? what was I thinking. I wish I would meet a girl that meshed with me. but if only get my treated badly again. oh well I'm not going to change cause I know one day it'll get me the girl i've been looking for. FINISH "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, hello Mr. Paper. I am so happy to be here writing about what is on my mind. Where should I start. ""Start"", isn't that a funny word. About as funny as the guy next door because he is singing to some girly song. Well, this might be pretty long because I type pretty fast. My eyes are so tired. Sometimes I think my mind purposely pushes my eyelids down, hinting at me that I need to keep them shut for more than a few hours. Sometimes when I take deep breathes it hurts. ""Why?"" you ask. Well it is a long story. It doesn't hurt, but it puts a sharp pain in my left shoulder due to my car accident ( I won't get into it). So, I am a college student now. What does that exactly mean? I think it means I can finally be myself. I don't have to worry about what my parents will think. There is only one restriction still holding my true self down. My girlfriend that I still have, even though she doesn't even go to school here. She lives all the way over in Galveston, and I can't stand the way things are. I say that I am in love with her, but is that true when I am so happy to be away from her? Anyways, I say ""restriction"" because that is what she is right now. I literally have to check in with her, and she has to know everything I do. So I guess in a way I didn't get away from my parents. She took their place. So, I figure that as long as she is in Galveston, and completely attached to me, I have to have my fun here and then lie to her. I know it sounds bad, but if I were to tell her what I actually do here, I would have to spend endless amounts of hours on the phone with her because she would be so upset. OK, I am sick of talking about this. The women at this University are the most amazing I have ever seen. And I guess that is why I am having such a hard time with my girlfriend. I have never seen so many good looking women. I feel like I am in a candy store. And it helps that I am a good looking guy, because I get their attention. That sounds conceited, but I am an honest man. I know that some women are attracted to me, and I am attracted to many women. Also, I am highly flirtatious, so my girlfriend gets real scared with me being here. I just tell here all the girls are ugly. I brought a camera to school. I have some incriminating photos on that thing. I need to get those developed and locked away. Nothing too bad, but bad enough to get me in trouble with my girlfriend. You see, why does everything come back to her. I hate it. I don't want to have to worry about a relationship right now! But what do I do? I respect and love her too much to hurt her. So, I spend a lot of time trying to figure out what to do. Yet another thing I should be having to do. I just want to be here at college, go to class, study, meet people, have fun, and NOT worry about a relationship. Seriously, I have to get off this. Let's change the subject. I want to talk about cheese. Cheese is really weird. It comes from a cow, but how does it get to be cheese. I know there is an answer, but it is still a mystery in my mind. And then where do the holes come from? Are they bubbles of air, or did they just appear there, or did some kind of bug eat the cheese away? Swiss is my favorite. American is horrible. It just shouldn't be allowed. to be made. Cheddar is enjoyable. There are no other cheeses as far as I am concerned. They go great on hamburgers. With lettuce and mayo and ketchup, I can have myself a meal. Well, it is late and those little demons keep pushing my eye lids down, so I will end it here. It was wonderful to type on this lovely screen! "
Tell me about yourself.,"As I start my third semester at UT, I feel both excited and a little overwhelmed at once. First of all, I'm excited because this is probably the first semester that I feel truly comfortable with my life here. I am living with my sister which is so good for me. We get along really well and I really enjoy spending as much time with her as I can. Also, my exboyfriend is at UT with me now. He is now one of my best friends and it means so much to me that we are able to spend so much time together now. But fortunately the time that we did not spend together last year (because he was still in high school) was good for me as well. It enabled me to find out who I was before and become a more independent person before he came to join me here at UT. Because of our time apart, I made lots of new friends and was able to have a lot of fun even without him. So, this year, I not only have him with me, but I also have all the friends that I made last year so that I don't depend only on him. My best friend, unfortunately is not in such a good situation. Her boyfriend came to UT this year as well, but because he was away from her last year, she spent very little time at UT meeting new people and getting to know the campus and the city. She spent most of her time in Houston visiting him. As a result, this year, she spends all of her time with her boyfriend and associates with very few other people. Although, I know that she's really happy right now that her boyfriend is here with her, I realize that if something happens to her relationship with him, she will be left with very few friends to turn to. Since she made such little effort last semester to develop such friendships, I fear that she will feel really isolated if she is left without him. She barely even talks to me much anymore because she is so involved with him. But I try to hold this against her because I know that she is not trying to ignore me, but she just really enjoys spending time with her boyfriend. But other than that, I'm really happy with my social situation right now. It is a really good thing that I have this support of all my friends at this time, because I realize that this is probably going to be one of the hardest semesters of my college career. I am taking 4 architecture classes in addition to this psychology class. Three of these classes involves building models, drawing orthographics, and designing. Two of them involve large amounts of reading and writing papers. In the first week, I already am swamped. Although I know myself well enough to know that I will definitely finish all my projects, somehow I still stress out about them a bit, just thinking of all the work that they will involve and worrying about how many latenighters I will have to pull (especially when I think of the fact that I have 8:00 classes every day of the week!). And I would love to work this semester to earn some money to pay for all the projects that I will have to build because I know how expensive they get. But, I realize that with the huge load I have so far, working is almost impossible for me. If I could have my way though, I would work at a restaurant in town. I worked at Pappasito's over the summer and I really loved waiting tables. I met so many great friends and it was fun meeting new guests and serving them. I think the reason I loved it so much was definitely because of all the people I met. There were mostly guys that I worked with and they were all so friendly to me. We would always talk during the shifts and then go out for drinks after work. I got to know lots of them very well and even dated one for sure. It was really great meeting people that in many ways were very different than me. It gave me new perspectives and taught me new things about myself. "
Tell me about yourself.,"3:34 twenty minutes to write what I am thinking Well, I am writing this at a time when I should be in class, but at least I am doing my homework. Between reading the book and doing the writing assignments, I think I have this class covered. I must admit I hate missing class because there are so many hotties in the class. When ever I get bored listening to the discussion that is merely a repetition of info in the book, I can stare around at the hundreds of fine chicks in the class. Don't get me wrong the class is interesting, but that's my thought. The guy that is sitting next to me smells bad. I know him, and has just said hello, The only reason I know him is because he is in many of my music classes, and his girlfriend is Hot. Holy shit, she just came in here to talk to him. This is really fucked up. I am trying to evesdrop as I write this. He is telling her what to do. oh wait they are noticing me, she left. Why does she date hIM? He's so nasty. I'm hungry, I ate not to long ago, maybe I want a cigarette. Busy busy busy, have a trombone lesson at five, still have to get my instrument from the instrument NAZI. He was on the sick out we all hate him. Some dude I don't know came up to the guy next to me and pretended to be him girlfriend by rubbing his shoulders, It was funny, I am really starting to get tired of this, but hey anything for a good grade. I am thinking to much abbot what to write. what to think. I am hungry, I wonder what happened in class today I'll just read the next chapter of the book, I like the book it is interesting. Lots of people in the lab today, feel kind of weird writing, can't wait tell Friday, actually every day is good when I am not in class and don't have anything to do. The dude next to me started talking to me, I hate him, I don't even know what he said. Hey 3:54 see you bye "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right at this very moment I am feeling very anxious and very stirred up. I am thinking about everything that is due this week and I am very nervous. Not the good kind of nervous that keeps you on your toes, but the kind that makes you want to vomit. I am sitting here typing this paper and not really knowing what I am going to write next. I am kind of stuck right now on what to type, but the assignment calls for us to write exactly what pops into my head while typing, and I guess this is it. I am thinking that I should be someplace right now I think that I may have missed something important all of a sudden. That is really scary. I hate that feeling. I am really tired right now and could really use a nap. I tossed and turned all last night and couldn't fall asleep. I woke up about every hour wondering where I was and if I had overslept and missed my class. Man I need some sleep. I really want to go home now, I am tired of this school already and I haven't even been here a week. I keep telling myself it will get better, it just has to, but I am really not sure of anything at this time. My life has been turned upside down, I have left the comforts of my house to come down here, and apparently I am supposed to be educated. I really don't think that I am going to be too much more educated than I already am. I think that college is just more of a matter of survival than skill. And I am paying plenty of my hard earned money to go here and be tortured like this. Man I wish my parents had enormous amounts of money so I could just come down here like some people and just play and have a good old time, but no I am here and I can't flunk out, because I am not able to drop any courses, or else I will not be considered a full time student. If that isn't stress I don't know what is. Anyways that seems to be my thoughts about the grand University of Texas right now. I have a feeling it might change within the next couple of weeks. It had better, or else I may not make it here. I considered just up and walking out and never coming back. It kind of seems like a bad idea. I am thinking also that I should not be having to write this paper if nobody is going to be grading it. I think it is a waste of my time. But apparently it isn't if it will help my grade. It seems really pointless to me that I have to write this paper for nobody. These walls are really green and who puts green and white carpet to cover walls. Walls are not supposed to be carpeted. I am the only person that is writing a paper right now and I think that I am being really loud. Nobody is saying anything but I know that they are looking over here watching and looking to see what I am doing making all that click click of the keys on the keyboard. Spanish is really going to kick my butt! I do not really comprehend anything and how I don't want to go to that class after I write this paper. I have about four minutes of writing left. What joy it brings me knowing that I am almost done with this assignment. What if I have done the assignment wrong? What if this is one of the papers the graders actually read and they think that it is bad and they give me a big fat F for my grade. ARGGGG! I think I am going to give myself an ulcer by the end of this semester! It seem like all I have on the brain is School school, school. I get to go to the Football game this weekend. Matt is going to come home and I get to see him. I guess that will be some fun. I am glad that I don't live in Stephenville. I need to call him either tonight or tomorrow and see where I am supposed to pick him up at on Friday. There is a picture of a paper clip with a light bulb over its head and it is winking at me. That is really irritating. They really need to take that off of the computer program. Who ever comes up with some of this stuff? I wish I could just sit in an office all day and come up with ideas about different things. I think that would be fun. I really need to spell check this document now. The weekend is almost here. What fun. The paper clip is asking me what I want to do now. A talking paperclip, who would have ever thought. "
Tell me about yourself.,"why am I being forced to submit my consciousness to the ut psychology department? the entire situation is abhorrent. it is wrong that there is no reward for completing this assignment it is not part of the grade, it is only taken away from the grade if one does not do it. the current state of the field called psychology frightens and disgusts me of course, if my writing assignment is one the few that actually gets selected or enough words pop up on the screening, then this will probably unfavorably affect my standing. insulting one's life work is no good, but this is how I feel and know it to be. because I have a dangerous weapon called reason and psychologists can try to convince me that I am mistaken, but I do not doubt myself. the problem with natural selection is that has been warped, mutated almost like a cell becomes cancerous if it is tinkered with enough. we have tinkered with natural selection, tried to control it, and now it is selecting out the strong and protecting the weak. this I know. what to do about it? I don't. these negative things come to mind whenever I am faced with dealing with this psychology class and its insidiousness. it is a perfect example of hundreds of kids who should not be in college, do not want to be in college for the sake of learning  having all of these dangerous misconceptions being dumped into their limp, willing brains. I have noticed how even a gap of two years can make all the difference. maybe it's not even a timerelation thing. again, it is that weak and deathloving portion of society that is being protected from this new, malignant form of ""natural"" selection. if this sounds disturbing, well it is. I don't appreciated being forced to submit and I emphasize that word, my consciousness to be at the disposal of the ut psychology department. this has nothing to do with my benefit. I could and do this often on my own time. but I am submitting this to them under the threat of punishment, and for what? I don't exactly know, and that makes it worse. I have few things of value in this world, but I do have my mind and my intellectual property. I do not appreciate being forced against my will to give it up to any random person who obtains a PhD. but that should further go to exemplify the way this newly dominant breed works. does this sound radical? very well, it sounds radical. it is radical. just as a ""serious"" presidential candidate playing with subliminal messages in advertising is radical and frightening, so is this. and the ridiculous thing about all that is bush jr or the experts he has hired to think for him are trying to subliminally affect a group of people that don't even have the power to elect him. a more productive way to sleaze into the white house would be to simply bribe the electoral college. how did we come to this state of affairs? by people refusing to think, I suppose. not being willing to think because of the discomfort involved. these are the people who should be selected out, yet are not. how did this come to be? I don't know. maybe television is performing some sort of mind control we don't even know about, as conspiracy theorist as that sounds. track my thoughts and feelings as they occur. what if I don't think in language? what if I think in images, sounds, smells, etc? how are you to know how I think? stream of consciousness is not writing. it is babbling onward and forward as a three year old would do. if animals could talk or write, stream of consciousness is what they would do. thank god, my time is almost up. I suppose I should say that I've never met a psych major that I liked or respected, since that is what just popped into my head. in submitting this, I suppose I am allowing whoever is analyzing this to do whatever they please, plagiarize, or otherwise. it is no longer my property, I have been forced to give up a part of my mind. so it can be categorized and used as someone's research and study. I will fit into the category of bitter, paranoid lesbian female from small town outside of texas, nonfreshman, English major. I have seen my life summed up by such words before, also by such people as yourselves. I suppose I should save this as the computer and website seems to be messing up right now. no way in hell I want to do this all over again. oh look  time is up. I guess you won't be privy to my thoughts any longer. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Yesterday in class we talked about what different parts of the brain are in control with. One interesting part to me is the Occipital Lobe. Three years ago I was in a car accident, which I have fully recovered from, expect I have blurred vision in my right eye. Within a few months after the accident I went to many doctors to see what the problem was. One doctor concluded that my optic nerve had been jarred which can cause loss of eyesight. He said that after a year if my nerve turned white then that meant that this is what happened. He also said that I would never regain my eyesight in that eye. Now that it's three years later, there is still no sign that my optic nerve was injured and my eyesight has gradually come back but it is a very slow process. Another doctor could not reach a conclusion but he figured that it might have something to do with my brain. He told me that you could never tell if the brain can overcome such a catastrophe but the brain can do miraculous things. Sometimes during the semester I may come in a see what you think it could be because no one else seems to come to a conclusion matching another professional's opinion. I do not know if such a thing could happen to the occipital lobe so I would like to come in and see if just part of your eyesight can be affected if this lobe has damage done to it. "
Tell me about yourself.,"How should I start this? Writing about my thoughts and feelings is kind of difficult when asked to put them down into words. I mean, I think about things all the time especially when I am walking to class or trying to go to sleep. Right now I am at my friend Desiree's house and I am doing this assignment because I have not done any homework tonight, and I feel like I need to do something before I go to sleep. Desiree is so great! She is my best friend up here in Austin. When I think about how we met(we met in Chicago at a Youth Leadership Forum the summer after our Junior year of High School) and that we both came to U. T. , it astonishes me how fate works. I am a firm believer in fate. My mom always worries about me getting killed in a car accident or getting attacked or something, but I always tell her that a meteor could come through my ceiling at ten o'clock at night and kill me if God wants me dead. There is no stopping fate. But then again, maybe I put too much trust into fate. I always think that things happen for a reason and that if something is meant to be, it will happen. I think that is a good thing to believe. It gives you a positive outlook on life. When something bad happens, I always remind myself that it happened for a reason. This sort of thinking really helps me get over stuff. I bet that everyone who does this assignment ends up talking about love. I think that love and relationships are always on people's minds. I know that I think about it often. Wondering what my future husband is doing right now at this very minute or thinking about some guy that I like. I don't have a boyfriend in Austin right now, but in some ways I'm glad that I don't. I find that when I like a guy I end up thinking about him in class instead of paying attention to the class. That can really get me into trouble. Who knows? I really need to do well this semester. I am shooting for a 4. 0! I think that getting a 4. 0 would be awesome, and I am going to do it! I want to do it at least once before I graduate from college. That is one of my goals. That may sound kind of sad, but I really want to just to show everyone that I am here and I got a 4. 0. Even if it is only once, I want to do it. Well, my twenty minutes is up and I really need to get some sleep so I can work on getting that 4. 0 GPA. It was nice talking to ya whoever you are. "
Tell me about yourself.,"For the past couple of weeks, I have been wondering about one question: Why am I here? As I go from class to class I look around at all the other students just like me standing around like they are waiting for something. What are they waiting for? Should I be waiting for something? A lot of changes have happened to me in the past 3 weeks. As these changes take place, I wonder, ""I guess this is what everyone is supposed to do. Everyone gets caught up in doing what is expected from everyone else. If I were to ask someone as I walk by, ""Why are you here at UT?"" an overwhelming majority would probably reply by saying, ""I don't know"" or ""That's a good question. "" So with that said, I ask myself, ""Why am I here?"" I guess the reason for everyone to go to college is to make a higher salary than someone who doesn't go. If that is true then why is it that some of the richest people in the world did not go to college? Michael Dell is a prime example. He is not your everyday college dropout. He is making more money than probably 97 percent of college graduates. So is college a way of evening everyone out? Someone could have had big dreams of starting their own business and carrying out the American Dream; whereas someone else could be forced to go to college by their parents, end up graduating in the middle of the class, but still hold the same kind of job as the person who wanted the American Dream, but got it spoiled by being ""brainwashed"" in college. So what exactly does ""brainwashed"" mean? Everywhere I have been in college, there are professors talking about, ""When you graduate, you can get a job at a big important firm and then you'll be set for life. "" NONSENSE. I don't want to work for someone. Nevertheless, everyone starts to agree with these statements and go to a business, get an ok  paying job, settle with where they are, and never look back to see where they took the wrong turn. I don't want to have to ""use"" my degree when I ""get a job. "" I want to hire other people to use their degree. On second thought, I'm glad professors tell college students to find a job with a big company when they graduate. That big company is going to be me. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Wow, that psychology chapter is really long. I am so mad at myself for letting myself get so far behind already. Hello, it's only my third week of school and I am already more behind than I ever want to be. I wonder if typing on my computer bothers Gina as much as it bothers me when she does it. Do I have enough selfdiscipline to make myself catch up on all this stuff or am I just going to keep procrastinating until I absolutely have to get it done, like the night before a test. I really hope I can make myself catch up because then I can go out and have fun and not have to worry about what I have to do when I get home. I don't know why I let that bother me so much. Last night, I wasn't really having any fun at all and they all said it was the funnest party of the year. I wonder if it's because I didn't get completely wasted or if it's because I don't like their idea of fun, or if I was just in a bad mood. And why would they think there's something going on between me and Gerardo. EWW! I mean he's nice, but come on. I thought this wasn't going to be like high school. Shouldn't I be able to be friends with a guy without everyone thinking there's something going on between us? Eww! Oh, well. I hope I have more fun with them soon. I would hate to have just joined this organization that they all seen to be totally into and me just not like it at all. I want to be able to gush about how much I love it to all of my friends and family back home and the ones here. What if it turns out I hate Longhorn Singers? That would really be a shame. What if I can't find any organizations I can really get into here? Like the whole dance thing. I looked at UT Dance Team and they looked like a drill team trying to dance with really bad choreography. And the Roustabouts just seems a little too provocative for me even though I think jazz is so fun. Why does it have to be all about sex (as Bryanne says) I really want to take some kind of jazz class because I need to expand my horizons so I can move to New York or Los Angeles and be a dancer on Broadway or a backup dancer for some music artist or in someone's music video. Would it be great if I could just dance and sing and get paid enough money for it that I could live comfortably? If that was guaranteed, I'd be there in a heartbeat. I wonder if this is what I'm really passionate about. All the advisors and professors here keep telling us to find something that we really love to do. I mean I have so much fun when I dance and perform in front of people and to just learn new dances and watch myself in the mirror all day would be paradise to me. It would just be fun a job of pure fun. But, come on, who really gets to do what they really want to do. Who really wants to be a lawyer or a garbage man? People do what they do to make money and I think that's so sad, but I'm one of those people, too. Money is important to me. It doesn't rule my life but it is definitely a factor. I don't want to work my butt off at something and not get paid what I deserve or what I've earned for it. And our society is just completely out of whack. Why do basketball players get paid millions of dollars and still miss free throws? Why are teachers so underpaid? They should be some of the highest paid people in the world, I think. Because of them, we are able to learn. We would be nowhere without our teachers. That's such a shame. It pitiful that our society is that out of touch with reality. Just look at Hollywood. What a mixed up place that is, yet it looks like so much fin to me. I would love to be famous. To have everyone in the world or at least in the country know who you are and idolize you and you be a role model to them. That would be a blast. All you would do is socialize all day and make the occasional movie here and there or pose for a few magazines. Go to awards shows, and travel. I want to travel so bad and learn all different foreign languages. But I don't want to learn them part way. I want to be fluent in the way that I don't use words in the wrong context so that people in that country think I'm stupid like we do when someone can't speak our language correctly. I wonder what that would be like to change cultures. No one would know anything about you or your past. Like Ludwig. You could be a total loser/reject in our society and be a heartthrob/most popular kid in school in another country. And you're kind of mysterious because no one knows any thing about you. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I had to wait until today to do this assignment because every time I wanted to do it or remembered to do it, my boyfriend Michael was in the room. I didn't feel like I could do a true stream of consciousness assignment if I knew that he was going to look over my shoulder at any second. I guess I knew that my mind was on other things besides him at the time; stuff that I didn't want him to know about. He would kill me. Not in the literal sense of course but in any case, he would be destroyed. If I told him what I was thinking it would be the end. I don't want it to be the end. I'm not saying I don't want it to (I've got mail, and I really want to check it, but I'm going to keep typing) go on forever, but I love him enormously and if I told him that while he was gone for an evening I slept in another guy's bed and we ended up fooling around. that would obviously not be exactly great for my relationship with Michael. I've always been big on honesty, but why can't I bring myself to tell him the truth about what happened between Damian and I? Maybe because he'd ask why and I'd say that I'm not even really sure why. That's a big problem with our conversations. If he asks me why or what's wrong (he says ""what?"" a LOT) I can't ever give him a straight answer because if there is something wrong then I usually can't pinpoint it enough to describe it and if I attempt to describe it, then it usually comes out sounding wrong and then he'll bring it up later because he's like an elephant. he never forgets. So I'm still trying to figure out why? Maybe I needed something exciting. I've known Michael for years and we've been dating for over 8 months. I was never really physically attracted to him, but only later I was because I loved him. The first time I met Damian I almost stopped in my tracks. I don't know why. maybe it was because the first time I saw him was when I walked into a friend of a friend's apartment (he's my friend's friend's roommate) he had his shirt off and was working on his laptop. After that night I couldn't stop thinking about him and I heard (dang it, why didn't I put an away message for my instant messenger. That friend of mine that I was just talking about IMed me but I told her I had 10 minutes left so I'll talk to her later. probably about this assignment and because we've been discussing this Damian issue) through the grapevine that he was attracted to me too. The next time I went over there I didn't really talk to him much. but the third time I was sitting on a couch watching movies with them and he sat next to me and we could tell that the chemistry was definitely there. After that we started emailing each (okay taking the towel off of my head. or maybe not, my hair's not quite dry yet. I'll just unwrap it) other. Then the night two weeks ago that Michael went to a concert, I went to Damian's apartment with my friend and we all hung out. Nothing too spectacular. I didn't intend on staying over but I developed a paralyzing headache and by the end of the night I was so sick that I couldn't move, much less drive. The guys offered to let me stay at the apartment so I wouldn't have to drive home and the rest is history. I felt so guilty lying in bed with him though. He had asked me if he could get in bed with me and I said yes. I said yes. I didn't move away when he put his arm around me or when he started rubbing my back. I didn't look at him when he started pulling me closer to him but I didn't pull away either. I was very still when he kissed my forehead, but I didn't tell him to stop there. Why didn't I? Because I wanted it. But I have a loyal, devoted, loving, honest, wonderful boyfriend already. Why did I want this, or think I needed it? It was thrilling. Even though Damian was a bad kisser. It was like kissing a large mouth bass. Eventually I gave in and snuggled next to him with our bodies nicely intertwined. It wasn't really sexual. For the most part. This is making me sound horrible. I probably am horrible. Yeah, I am. This was cheating. And by not telling him and by still communicating with Damian via phone now and still email, I continue to be deceptive. Damian doesn't even want an attachment because he travels a lot for his job and may even be moving to London at the end of the year. And I don't love him. I don't really know him. I've hardly been around him except for three or four times. We've had two meaningful conversations. The whole concept of a relationship with him is silly. Yet I haven't been able to stop thinking about him since I met him and wondering about him, etc, etc. I just had to fix my towels because they were falling off of me (just got out of the shower before I started this). My palms are kind of damp, not good for a laptop probably. Okay, it's been more than 20 minutes so I'll stop now. I wonder why I wrote a confession of sorts. And I wonder if anyone will actually stop to read this. I'd better not save this, just in case Michael finds it. I'm terrible. "
Tell me about yourself.,"As I write my first writing assignment, I can't help but notice the time: 5:55pm. As usual, my radio is on. It only takes away the silence in my apartment. Blank. My head is blank. Empty. With nothing to say or write about. This has never been a problem before. In high school, there was never silence. Maybe I was always too busy to hear the silence. Now, it's a part of my life. At certain times last year, I could hear it. Weird, seeing how it was my freshman year in college. This year is my second year and I seem to hear nothing but silence. I am still involved in the same activities as last year. Perhaps, it's a sign that I'm finally growing up. Another weird concept. I am thinking that I like silence. Deep down, I do believe that I am a loner. In high school, who would have thought? A loner should be lonely, right? But I am not lonely nor am I ever bored. I like to do things by myself. I think that's it. I don't need anyone. I don't need companionship nor do I need to be felt needed. Awww. to much of the word, ""need"". No more. I am happy. I am content. I am selfassured. I told my mom once that I was a loner, but I can't remember what she said. I don't think she even responded to me. Funny thing though. I know I want to be married someday. Now, how would a loner accomplish something like that? I socialize very little these days. My mind is always on school and my studies. I just want that medical acceptance letter in my hands. That is all that counts. Well, not all. My family counts too. They mean more to me than anything. My little brother is here at UT. (he's no longer little anymore) I'm hoping he enjoys his first year. I know I did. So many memories to reminisce. Time: 6:11pm. My goal this semester is: 4. 0 GPA. I really need to bring up my GPA from first year. And my goal next semester is: 4. 0 GPA. My uncle always says, hard work will always be paid off in the end. Consistency + Confidence = Success. 4. 0, 4. 0, 4. 0, 4. 0, 4. 0, 4. 0, 4. 0, 4. 0, 4. 0, 4. 0, 4. 0, 4. 0, 4. 0, 4. 0, 4. 0, 4. 0, 4. 0, 4. 0, 4. 0, 4. 0, 4. 0, 4. 0, 4. 0, 4. 0. I hope I can do it. I hope I can do it. I hope I can do it. I know I can do it. I hope I won't be behind in my classes. Especially in that chem. Class. It seems like a really hard class. I can feel those late nighters already. Time: 6:15pm. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am so mad right now. I have tried so many times to go to the Internet site for this class, and it says error. The URL. I am upset. This thing is due Friday. So now I'm in word, waiting for the stupid site to be fixed. I just got off the phone and the conversation made no sense. There was a party in the town I am from, and some guy got stabbed and died. He was 35 and from San Antonio. The weird thing is that no one knows who stabbed him. Now to me this makes no sense. They were at a PARTY. There are usually people everywhere. Oh well. I have a lot of stuff to do. Me and Allison are going apartment hunting tomorrow. It's weird, I've only known her since I moved here in August, and already we are good friends and plan on living together next year. We want to live at Orange Tree because it's cute. I looked on the Internet for some info on it, and there is none. I think it is stupid that we have to go apartment shopping in September for a place we won't move into for almost a year. Oh well, we are doing it now so we don't get screwed. I was just talking to Corey, my cute boyfriend, and I was telling him about the pleasure center in mice and how different it was from humans. I always tell him what I've learned in class because it helps me remember it. I feel sorry for him, I wouldn't want to hear it if I were him. He's so nice like that. I ordered cookies last night from Tiffany's Treats, they deliver freshly cooked cookies to your door. Anyway, I was in a friend's room at Hardin Housewhich I hate and we were talking about boyfriends and stuff. I told them I want to get married on November 19, 2005 to Corey. They laughed and asked why, so I told them. We've actually talked about marriage, and we both love each other that much, so it's cool. We want to live together in a couple of years. Actually he is going to live near us at Orange Tree if at all possible. He has a brother who is a year younger, Codey, who is a pothead. He has a girlfriend Amy, who I don't like. She's only a freshman in high school, but she doesn't belong with him. Corey and Codey are total opposites. I have a lot of work to do. Tonight I have to do calculus, read for my freshman seminar, and do my Italian work. I got a quiz back today from that class, and I got a 75. I was so upset. I'm used to A's. Italian is not a required course for my major, so I was wondering if I could take it pass/fail. That would be good, then it couldn't bring down my GPA. I need to ask some one about that. I hate my roommate and suitemate. They are so damn loud. Caroline, the suitemate has people over now who are very loud. I like it quite, but that doesn't happen here at Hardin House. I went through rush this year and got a bid from A Chi O, but I decided not to pledge. I am glad I didn't because they are out all of the time, and I'm taking 16 hours this and every other semester. I want to finish in three years, so I have to take 16 hours every semester, and 6 in each summer session. That's cool with me though, since I don't feel really comfortable here. My dad is an accountant for the Floresville ISD, in Floresville, TX. We don't have the major bucks, which is totally opposite from the girls that live here. We aren't poor by any means. I have a 2000 Eclipse which my dad got me for my birthday last year. My brother is premed here at UT. Actually, he's supposed to graduate in December. He took an extra semester to take some business courses. He's really smart, but he likes to party. He was a Fiji, and that is just a synonym for partier. I don't like to party much at all. If I didn't have Corey, I'd probably party, but I'm just not compelled to get drunk on Friday and Saturday and spend Sunday recuperating. That is not my idea of a good time. It used to be though. My sophomore year, I was the party queen. I have never done drugs in my life. No pot, coke, or anything. I did drink a lot, but I don't anymore. The last time I got drunk was a ""Roundup"" in April. I threw up on my own shoe. Needless to say, I don't do that anymore. Corey has never been drunk before. He's so innocent to meet, but only I know the ""real"" him. I think that's cool. I just got an email from my exboyfriend. We dated for almost a year and a half, but I had to break up with him because I liked Corey more. Me and Corey will have been together for 10 months on 092000. He's so wonderful. I'm obsessed with him, which is okay by me. I'd do anything for him. My birthday is the day of the Houston game. My family is coming down and so is Corey (he's only a senior). We are planning on going to Hudson's on the Bend, which is one of my absolute favorite places ever. We ate at the Oasis on Friday. We got lost, but it was still fun. I was so scared when we got to my brother's house. He lives on the east side of 35 which is really scary. We were trying to unlock the door, and a car parked across the street and watched up get in. "
Tell me about yourself.,"From what I gather, I'm supposed to sit here and track what I think as I think it. At this moment, all I can seem to think about is how I missed BA101 earlier today. I went to Calculus, which ended at 2:00 pm, and I was supposed to go to BA101 at 5:00pm. In between this three hour period, I went to sit with a friend while he ate lunch, followed by going up to his room to get a copy of a virus scanner and a game. In doing so, I completely forgot that I even had another class. I ended up watching and playing a video game. I came back, feeling just fine, when my roommate asked, ""Did you go to class?"" I actually had to stop and think, ""Did I have a class to go to?"" Of course, as I've said, the answer was ""yes. "" Now, I can't escape this panicked, empty feeling in my chest. If there's one thing I generally take pride in, it's my academic ""excellence. "" Part of our grade in the class is based (Of course, I had to miss one of my whopping two classes that actually take attendance!) on participation in discussions, etc. One can easily infer that you might actually need to be there in order to take any part. I already participated one event for the five we can have for extra credit, but I don't know if that will cover the points I'm sure to have lost for not going to class today. Incidentally, the way we are awarded points in that particular class seems asinine. Some of the time, we're in small discussion groups, and other times we're in a large auditorium for lectures. Anyway, while we're in our discussion groups, we're awarded ""x"" amount of points per period based on whether or not the TA feels, at that moment in time, that you've contributed something useful to the group. This is silly because sometimes people just plain don't have either an opinion or much of any knowledge on the topics they may present. Also, if there is something that can be said, it may be declared by someone else before the opportunity to speak presents itself. The grading for our larger project seems to lack sense as well, but we haven't actually started it, so I don't know all that it entails. Now that I've gotten that out, I feel a little bit more relaxes about my predicament because I seem to recall that the amount of points one can receive per class is minute in comparison to the project that is yet to begin. Plus, there is that extra credit. I'll have to be sure to get all the extra credit I can. From what I've been told by those who've actually taken the class, it's supposed to be an easy ""A. "" Even still, I'm not starting off on the right foot. This was only our third class day. It's a onehour course that meets, for me at least, only on Thursdays. That's a good thing and a bad thing. It's good because there's plenty of time in between class days to get all the goals accomplished (if you make it to class and actually know what those goals are. ). It's bad because now I have a whole week to think about today's ""event. "" I must stop now. I set an alarm, and my twenty minutes are up. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Sitting here in front of my large window, I notice the rays of sun filtering into my dorm room. Everything feels fresh and clean, except for that pile of clothes laying next to my bed. I love warmth any form of it actually. Sometimes I wonder why my hands and feet get so cold. Does my heart not pump hard or fast enough? My old special boyfriend used to tell me, ""cold hands, warm heart. "" That was something his mother used to say. I guess she had cold hands too. Right now, I am wondering about my present faith and how that should impact or change my actions and choices. I am no way questioning my faith in God, but instead, how such faith should be transforming me throughout this transition period that I am experiencing. For instance, ever since going through rush and pledging, I have been put into many situations that I am not normally used to. Basically, my biggest concern is partying and or drinking. For me personally, I feel that alcohol is something that I really don't need to have fun. Then, why did I go against my believe and have a drink anyway? After confronting myself in front of my god of such temptation and hypocrisy, I have done much better. Going to the parties, I merely say, ""No thanks, I'm fine"" when offered the drink. I am so blessed to have the friendship of Jeff. It's funny how close or connected you can feel to somebody when you've only known them for a couple of months. Some of my friendships that have lasted for years are not nearly as close as the companionship that I am experiencing with Jeff right now. The only problem is that I feel myself really starting to like him. Actually, in reality, deep down I have what they call a ""crush"" for him ever since we met at the Christian camp that we worked at together. I'm not sure what he thinks he is so incredibly complimentary to me, so I have the suspicion that he may reciprocate some of my feelings. All of our discussions circle around God and Jesus. I have never known anybody so passionate for their believes. Overall, it makes me feel like I should be moving in a different direction, a higher one with my relationship with Christ. This takes me back to the partying scene  What I see there is not glorifying God or His name. Yet, if I can, in some way, glorify His name while I am there, then my actions will coincide with my believes, right? In a way, the only thing I can count on is prayer and patience. It makes me think of Moses and his life in Egypt. By faith and trust in God, Moses and his people passed through the Red Sea. I have faith in my Lord that He will provide me with direction and strength, like he promised to Moses in the Bible. This leads me to think about my education. Sometimes I wonder what my future will be like  What am I going to major in? How many years of college will I attend? Will I have a good job? Will I be married? Will I have children?  the questions are endless and sometimes it can even be entertaining to imagine how things will be. I've noticed that when I think about things like this, I always see the fairy tale side of the story. I see myself with a wonderful education, a highpaying and fun job, an incredible husband, and three cute and perfect kids. This fairytale imagination of mine can lead to bad things or to a lost in the grasp of reality. I remember going into high school coming from a small, private middle school and thinking that I would be playing varsity everything, would have tons of new friends, and I even thought that I would be dating a cuter, older guy. Well, this was not the case. Things happened very differently. I ended up, by the end of my high school career having all of these things, but in a different way. I had six very close girl friends (not tons), I had a special guy in my life (actually a month younger than myself), and I made varsity softball (after two years of working really hard). Yet, looking back, I am so incredibly pleased as to how my life has traveled so far. So, looking ahead, I really must understand that as much as I want to pave the way for myself, that sometimes things happen differently than planned. Yet, there is a reason and there is a plan. Even when negative things occur, there is some kind of positive outcome, whether it's realized the next day or ten years down the road. Bad things are going to happen  it's inevitable, but it's essential to try to look at things in a different light, a "
Tell me about yourself.,"I have never considered myself a good student. I never studied in high school, and did not expect anything to change once I got to college. Now I find myself in my dorm doing my homework in advance. I wonder to myself, why? I am not the type of person to do things in advance, but now I am. I think the overwhelming challenge of college has presented itself to me. I used to be the person that would drop anything to go party, but now I'm in Austin, were there are many parties, but I am in my room typing a paper that isn't due until Friday, and it's only Sunday. I think that college has changed my way of thinking and acting, and I want to know why? I find myself wanting to learn, instead of having to learn. The thought that all of this studying will make me a smarter person, instead of just help me pass the test is actually a refreshing one. I still wonder to myself, why is this change happening now? Is it the transition from high school to college what is driving me to be a smarter person? I think that the challenge of studying and making good grades is actually helping me to become a better person. Or am I becoming a better person? Because of so much studying, and the quest for knowledge, I have less time for the people that I love. So is this good for me, or bad for me? Why do I study better when I am back home in Temple, TX? Is it because there are less distractions? In one hand there is Austin, where there is so many distractions, like Sixth Street and parties. In the other hand there is Temple, where all my friends are and all of the hometown parties. I have no idea why I study better when I am at home. I hope these are questions that I can answer after taking this course. I have never wanted any thing as bad as I want a 4. 0 this semester and I don't know why. This is good for me, but why the sudden change. For some weird reason I can not quit asking the question, why do I want to study so much? The key word is want. I do not feel that I have to study, but instead I feel that I want to study. This is such a leap from where I was only a few months ago. Have I done myself harm by changing so rapidly? Will this wear off after I get accustomed to being in college? I hope that it does not, because I like the fact that I want to study and do well in school. Why did I not find this way of thinking in high school? If I had would it have made a difference? I am not sure what made me such a different person in high school, but I would love to know, what was the catalyst behind this tremendous change in my attitude. Is there anyway that I could have caused this change if I had wanted to? I do not think so. The jump from high school to college is what has caused me to be a better student. Why do we as humans look back at things that we have done in the past and wish we could change them? After all it was us that did them. How can we now look back at a situation and make a different decision? I tend to look back and wish to change things, but then I think to myself, that I was the one that made the decision in the first place. I don't know what causes me to look back so often, but I think that I reflect more often then others. Is it because I was happier at the time that I am reflecting? I feel the same know as I always have, but I am a more serious person. I am a happy and easygoing person, by nature, but when I am going to school, I feel more uptight than usual now. I used to look at school as a time to hang out with friends and goof off, but know there is none of that, I am only here for one reason, to do a good job. Hopefully this will carry over to when I get a job and am supporting a family. I think that this attitude will help me to be a very hard worker. I find it relieving to write as I just have for 20 minutes. Actually I went over the time because it was so interesting that I was thinking in this way. I did not know that I had so many questions about myself, until I sat down and wrote about them. I found it easy to ask myself questions without giving answers. Maybe after taking the Psychology class I will be able to answer some of my own questions. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm thinking this is a different assignment and that it is going to be hard to just let thoughts come in naturally, since I am used to having a specific reason for writing. I always shake my leg. Yes, I do it all the time, like it is a nervous reaction. I think I am tense to often, always worrying about what I need to be doing or what I should be doing. I am trying to relax right now so that I am not tense. Stress keeps being the topic of discussions in my classes, Health Promotions, (eeh. my leg is shaking again!) Nutrition and Psychology. These classes seem to be overlapping each other a lot during subject matter. I don't know why I kept avoiding this assignment. I have been putting it off. I think I feel incompetent when it comes to writing. It's not something I would consider myself skilled at. Yes, writing intimidates me. I shouldn't think that I am so inferior. I bet ya'll don't even read these. hmm I wonder if you will read that sentence. Maybe, maybe not. Should I be using proper grammar and punctuation because I really like to go like this yeah I do it all the time when I am conversing over the Internet. The Internet. I'm suspicious of the Internet. It can't be all that good. I spend way too much time online. Just another distraction in this world that leads people away from the important things in life. I cannot possibly write all that I am thinking about, because random thoughts float in and out of my head and I can't type them all. And I forget them by the time I finished what I was typing. Ok. six minutes. I'm suppose to be natural. I don't think I am. I wonder if I should stay on subjects longer, because I really want to. I don't like all this jumping around. I think the main thing is that it has to be continuous. Well, that is easy. I'm always thinking. I think too much sometimes, if that's possible. You know what's been on my mind? I just got back from this scholarship dinner. I have no idea how I got that scholarship. I think they mixed up my name with someone else. I just seemed way under qualified compared to all the other recipients. WOW! There are some amazing people here. Some incredible smart and talented people, and I need to stop feeling inferior to them, because I have my good points also, and I am a very happy person. I'm content with my life. I wonder how many people really are struggling here. Everyone seems like they are just fine and dandy, but you know some people are really sad. People can hide their emotions easily. I doubt thought that a third of the people in my psychology class are depressed. If that is true, than that is very sad. I will admit it; I am cynical of depression. Yeah, sure everything is biological and you can trace it back to that and call it a disease, but really, your mind. that's where you control it. I keep hearing how our mind can heal us and how we think has an enormous impact. Do we not have control over our mind? That should be the one thing we do have control over, and that is where the power is. Is it really incorrect to say that depression is all in your mind? I think not. I guess that I'm not being fair to the depressed people because my life is good. close enough to perfect for me. I am lucky to not have to deal with all the garbage many people have to deal with. I had a good child hood, good parents. No worries really. But, it is not like I've never been depressed. I spent most of my freshman year in high school depressed, but now I look back and understand why I felt that way and how silly it was, and I don't plan on doing that again. I guess, you just have to live and learn. I mean it's ok to do what's wrong just as long as you eventually figure out it's wrong and fix it. Ok. what was that all about? I ramble so much. It's hard for me to have conversations with people because my mind always feels like it's in 10 places at once. I'm tired. I really am. I always feel a little tired. I had a terrible encounter with mono my freshman year in high school. It was horrible, and ever since then I get tired easily. Maybe it's all in my head and I can convince myself that I'm not tired. I should try this. It could be very beneficial. I am already starting to procrastinate. Why? Why is procrastination and epidemic among youth? Hey, I think time is up. I could go on for hours, but I really should get to my other homework. or not. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Okay, I am starting to write for this assignment. I don't really know what I'm supposed to write, but I guess it's sort of like a journal and I'm supposed to write whatever I am thinking. I am kind of overwhelmed by school right now. It is so big here, and it's kind scary. I'm used to knowing everyone around, but here I don't know anyone. Friends is on right now. It's pretty funny. I miss being in Houston where everything is normal. I'm not used to the times shows come on here. This sounds really stupid, like I am just rambling on about nothing. Friends is funny. Am I doing this right? I don't know if this is what y'all are asking me to do. I miss John, the guy I am dating from Houston. I don't really want anything serious with him, but I like him a lot so I am kind of confused on what I should do. Should I have my fun and not date someone I really like a lot, or should I date him and maybe miss out on opportunities to have fun at school. I don't know I am not sure. And then there is my exboyfriend Ricky. I don't want to be with him, but sometimes I miss him. I think it is only when I think back on high school I think about the good times we had and I miss that. I also don't like it that maybe I made the wrong choice in not wanting him and moving on. What if I totally regret it in the future, and I want him back, but he doesn't want me. That would be horrible. I don't know. I'm just pretty confused right now. I don't know what I want about anything. It's hard getting used to everything around here. I miss the show 90210. I was just thinking about it for some weird reason. That used to be my favorite show, but it got cancelled. I'm supposed to go to a frat party tonight but I don't know if I'm going to go or not. My roommate doesn't want to go cause she needs to do work. She's the same major as me. She's a pretty good influence on me. She gets me to go to meetings and stuff that I probably wouldn't go to if it weren't for her dragging me to them. I am filming the volley ball game on Saturday for a live broadcast. I'm glad I am getting involved somehow. I tried to get tickets to the OU game, but I couldn't they were already sold out when I was supposed to get them. I'm pretty bored right now. I probably have lots of grammar mistakes in here, but since I'm free writing, I don't think it really matters. At least I hope it doesn't matter. I'm a little scared about grades. I hope tests and stuff are not too hard. I'm not really thinking about anything right now, so I have nothing to right except that I have nothing in my head. This is a little hard; to right only what you are thinking and not thinking of something to write. I'm glad it rained today, it was nice. I love the rain. Ever since I was a life guard I have loved the rain, cause we got to close the pool and sit around getting paid for doing nothing a miss those days, back in the summer of my freshmen year. Everything was so easy back then, it kind of makes me sad thinking about it, but oh well, I guess I'll make new memories, and have a different kind if fun. Okay, well my time is up. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now I feel like there must be something more important that I could be doing. That's not to say that what I'm doing right now is unimportant, but I feel that there is something more imperative looming. I feel like I need to clean my room because all of my clutter is getting annoying to look at. I feel like I brought to many things with me to college in order to ensure my comfort, but all these things are only making me more uncomfortable by their presence. Tomorrow I have a test in chemistry that I think is going to be really easy. Hopefully it turns out as easy as I think it will. I don't really need any surprises right now. I wonder if the medication I'm taking for my earache is giving me all these rashes or if it's just the less than par level of cleanliness in the mighty Jester East. I heard that it's dirtier than Jester West but I'm beyond caring. Rat dander and roach feces don't bother me until I see them. The only thing that really nags me about my dorm room is the bed. Who knows what nasty things that old mattress harbors? If I was really anal retentive I wouldn't be able to sleep on it because of the thought of all the stuff that it has probably accumulated over the years, but instead I succumb to fatigue, grimace in disgust, and lay my head down once again. Speaking of which, my head itches. Rat dander, I tell you. In addition to my concern over the probable existence of rat dander is my concern over the obvious existence of dust. I have never seen quite so much dust. They told us that the air conditioning system wasn't working properly and that they were working on it. It appears to work just fine in regards to spewing dust all over my precious things that annoy me so much. I guess I'll just have to buy some eye drops to go along with the calamine lotion for all these rashes I've been getting. I got the last bottle at Jester store. It was sitting there sort of lonely like it didn't belong at all so I just grabbed it up. I scoff at the poor soul who doesn't develop rashes until a few days from now for he will be forced to go elsewhere for calamine. I think my leg rash might be flaring up again. That sucks. I wish I had absolutely nothing that I needed to do right now because then I could just sit in front of the tv watching a movie and scratching my leg. Now that's the life. Too bad I'm bogged down with college and all of this success waiting to happen to sit around and do nothing. And so ends my stream of consciousness as I am much too absorbed in my itchy leg to think any longer. Plus my 20 minutes is up. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am thinking about the fact that since I have gone to college I have absolutely no free time. I am so extremely tired, and I know that I can't go to sleep because I have so much homework to do. It is 12:40 in the morning and I just got home, from things that I had to do today. I am scared that everyone is mad that they never get to see me. My girlfriend probably thinks that I am trying to avoid her, but really I have no free time at all. The whole fraternity thing is fun, but I never have any time to do anything. I have met so many awesome people, and I am excited that I have only been here for 3 weeks and I have met people that I will be friends with for the rest of my life. My school work is also quite time consuming. What I do know is that I hope that I make my grades this semester. Tonight was a rough night, I think that I have done more work than I ever have in my whole life. My dorm room seems secondary to other places that I have to be during the day. The only time I am ever here, is when I am sleeping. My life has changed drastically, but I know it will all turn out great. I am sad for some of my friends from high school. Most of my best friends came to school down here, and the ones who did not seem scared. I still talk to my best friend, who I dated last year. Her birthday is this weekend, and she is not even going to spend it with her best friends. If I could be there for her I would, but I am extremely busy this weekend. I bought tickets to the Dave Matthews concert in Dallas this weekend, but I am not going to be able to go. My whole plan was to surprise my best friend with tickets, and myself in Dallas but of course it fell through. There are so many things that I want to do, but I feel swamped. I wonder what it is like for my parents, they are empty nesters this year for the first time in 30 years. 30 years they have had a child in the house, and suddenly nobody. I did not receive a good wrist band for the Texas OU draw, and I couldn't get tickets to the game. That makes me mad that I sat in line for three hours to get tickets, but I received none. Well I guess that is just another one of life's great blunders, standing in line. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well I type kind of slow so I might not get as much in this box as everyone else. Anyway, right now I'm thinking that I have way to many classes and am worried that I might not be able to handle all of them in the same semester. I would have been ok but now I have an SI section for each class and it has filled all my free spaces. On top of that I still have to come back here and study for my lectures every night. I don't have very much free time to do other things. I'm not getting the time I hoped to have when I came to have a good time while I got an education. I don't have any free time to join any organizations or even go out and have a good time. I'm a long way from home so I don't get to see any of my friends or my family very often but I'm trying to make the best of things. I think that I will eventually be ok when I get use to this drastic change in my life. I just kind of wish that I didn't have to start over at this point in my life because I liked the way everything was going for the past few years. Well my twenty minutes are up so I guess that's it. "
Tell me about yourself.,today is good I do not have many classes I just have to get up to be in class by 930 and that really sucks I want to be with tiffany but I don't know if I can trust her I think about her all the time and although I am half to blame I don't know if the break up is all because of me I triggered it but I don't know if she wanted to break up or me break up more my Andrew is working out okay he is in class it was good that he only a friend no anything greater I mean like a best friend I can only imagine living with a best friend wanting to chop his head we would just argue about stupid stuff tiffany is so wrong I don't understand anything when it comes to her I know nothing was fair yet I wanted to believe it was what is wrong with me it is funny how things that are so important matter to no one else and although someone can have empathy they still don't understand everything is different I want to know what to do I know that is not possible it bothers me I need to do good in school I want to be someone who be comfortable I guess relying on money is what I have for now I just feel that I would be proud to support a family the way I want them to be supported but will that affect the way they are going to be brought up I want to be a good father I want to do so much but I would do nothing if I could just have some answers if I could be certain for once man I miss the old days but at the same time I do look towards the future I do think about how things will be different how I don't know what the future holds and who knows it could be good or bad I learn either way I feel I am learning a lot and changing that is what I love I want to change to a better person I guess better can only be what I hold as better not society so I guess what I am saying is that I want to be secure of myself I want to be sure I know I can figure something out I know nothing is going to be easy about it and I don't expect immediate results I just want to make something of myself but I want to have answers and I want to have love all these things confuse me and make me feel alone I have to work on them it seems everything else is so trivial so pointless I don't know though I have yet to figure out what I want my future foundations to be I am trying to be picky because it is me I think society has some things wrong of course I mean it is democracy majority wins I don't think the majority is always right although they do count for some things this topic just blows me away I mean why do people do drugs and alcohol people have many different reasons I think if everyone can be responsible and do it to enjoy themselves if it possible I think it is okay I don't know though I don't really know anyone who can but I haven't thought much of the subject I mean I particularly think that alcohol is worse then marijuana I know both are not good for your body I wonder if it therapeutic in any way though how they allow that temporary escape I know you should deal with your problems and not run and it is harmful to be trapped by hiding in substance abuse but sometimes you things take time and maybe substance abuse can be used as therapeutic I don't know maybe I am full of it sometimes I feel I know what I can handle I know there are limits to be set and I feel I can exceed some I feel everyone has there own limits and I feel those people who cannot respect there limits are the reason for the universal set of limits makes me kind of mad but that is okay of course it would happen but I wish the limits I wish I could push sometimes could be understandable although I know they can't I know what they are and if I don't that is how I find out so maybe it isn't so bad to push the limit you find out where you go overboard and you can build from that and help others then again sometimes you are only one chance and sometimes it is only luck keeping you from screwing everything up when test limits I mean everyone test limits I just feel more respect for people who know there limits I would listen to someone more I feel so clueless the universe is too much for me 
Tell me about yourself.,ok I am starting writhing. I really don't know hat to right about but I will give it my best shot. I am going home today pretty excited about that. but in some ways I am not because I don't want to put up with my family. I am feeling a little bit guilty now for saying that because they are only trying to help me out. I like the way the sun shines through my window in my room. I am really happy to be here at university of texas. it is hard to write for a long period of time about nothing. I feel like I am writing in a journal or something. it is really quite today on my floor usually it would be extra loud because it is Friday. I am really excited to be in the longhorn band. it has been a really good experience so far and I hope it continues. I have meet some really great people and I hope that this friendship will continue for a lifetime. I saw one of my best friends sisters today and I was really surprised. for one I wouldn't think that she would talk to me but she did. I hope to see her again soon. I really need to get packed up to go home. I need to go get fitted for my uniform in band too. I took the pretesting this morning I never would have thought it would have taken so long. and it repeated the same questions over and over. it was really annoying 
Tell me about yourself.,"It's way too cold in this room to be doing anything that requires the use of my fingers alone. It's like an icebox, but that's good since I'm so hot natured. I bet that the people who type faster write more in twenty minutes than do those who are slow typists. That's almost not fair. We don't get as much of what their mind is thinking simply because their fingers can't go as quickly as their minds. Mine don't either though. I can type pretty fast, but that's because I do it so much. I'm going to get carpel tunnel syndrome some day. I've played the piano for almost 11 years now, play the flute, and type constantly. Yikes. But, back to the original point: this isn't exactly fair since it's, well, not the same. That's obvious. I guess nothing in science can be exactly precise. Exactly precise? That's wrong. I wonder if we're supposed to fix grammatical errors AND spelling errors when we're done. I should have set a timer. It's too much trouble for me to keep checking on the little clock at in the system tray. Oh well. We're too lazy these days anyway. Everything's being sacrificed for our own comfort and peace of mind. For example, I have a feeling that technology is a HUGE part of the growing number of cancer patients. A woman I know died last night. She had three children, the oldest a freshman in high school. What a tragedy. It makes you wonder if it's all worth it. Is better living, happier living? Is it even better in the first place? I think it's going to rain. It needs to. Someone said the other day that we're in our fourth year of drought now. I wonder if the drought is due to global warming, due to the depletion of the ozone layer, due to all these ""advances. "" There it is again. We think we're making improvements when in fact we're slowly killing ourselves, or our grandchildren. My Spanish teacher told us that the icebergs are melting, and someone next to me said that they are in fact melting at a rate of one foot per 15 hours (or 15 days?). That's very frightening. I don't know how thick icebergs are, but they won't be around much longer at that rate. My hands hurt now. I complain too much. I whine. :) It's a personality trait. And are these traits inherited biologically or learned? Heh. All this psychology is definitely getting to me. Mr. Pennebaker (or Dr. ?) said that we'd begin to see things from different perspectives; I didn't think it would be quite so soon. I do like the class though. I like the book. Mr. Myers isn't such a boring guy. He put excellent philosophic quotes and questions in with the technical aspects of what we're learning, or, rather, what he's trying to get across. I find it sad that so many people don't care about learning anything. For some, it's all about the grades. We joke in our dorm (that we so lovingly have nicknamed the Virgin Vault since boys aren't allowed on our FLOOR except on weekends) that we're just here for, not our PhD's, but our MRS's. I don't know who came up with that, but it's pretty cute. It's always scared me quite a bit  the idea of living my life for someone else. That's a bit of a clash with my lifestyle though, considering I was the president of our church youth group for two years, but I just couldn't do it for a man here on earth. I don't mean to say that getting married is giving up yourself, but the way some girls talk (about getting their MRS's), that's all they want to do with their life. That IS, to me, giving it up. What about their dreams and goals? Do they have any? Do I? Darn phone. I can hear everything around here. It's getting on my nerves. I lived in Hickville, USA (ok Canton, TX, but it's no different), where there were no people. I lived in the country, where there was no noise. It got so dark, and so quiet, in my room at night, that I could hear the bugs and the dog walk by, that my eyes never adjusted and were able to see. I haven' adjusted to things here yet. I wake up at 3 in the morning for no reason at all, doze back off, and wake up again at four. It's starting to become rather annoying. Normally I have no trouble sleeping. My mom and I are like that. She can sleep through anything, except her kids coming in. I thought it was neat how our class related that to our reticular formation and how it ""learns and remembers"" certain things. I don't think my reticular formation has anything to do with my waking up at odd hours. Well obviously is does since it's function is to control arousal, but it doesn't ""remember"" anything that happens at the wee hours of the morning. Hopefully. If so, it needs to get a touch of amnesia. Just a touch. That's my time limit! ttfn "
Tell me about yourself.,"My mind is pretty tired right now, but I can't get it off of having a good dark cup of coffee. I have gotten all of my work for this week done already so I'm at ease about that. Whenever I type I have to look at the keyboard so it kind of pisses me off. Now I'll let my mind wonder, I sometimes think of home and all of my trashed out friends there. Have you ever wished you could help a person you care about a lot, and they just won't listen to you? Well my friends back home have been doing drugs heavily for a while and I cannot do anything about it. In a time where controversy and sex sell the theme, it's hard to decide which is the winning team. There are just some things in life we can't understand, like why in the hell we can fight over land. I think we all need a helping hand, so we can rise together and make a stand. At a time perfectly linked to your transition can you even tell me your position? No because 90% of us don't even listen and make the right choice for our provisions. I see a new generation with many faces. Bringing together people from many different places. I think discrimination is in our past, but I do not know how long that thought will last. It is a society we ourselves cast, and sometimes it seems like a supernatural blast. To think of all our generations drugs, hell I myself have been associated with thugs. But still we have a consensual love, and I don't even think it comes from above. My thoughts and feelings always rhyme so prepare yourself because it's my time. Fuck all of the bullshit and fabrication, for we are the ones who'll shape this great nation. So I do have a proclamation What do we do without an education and occupation? In a time when money and power mean everything, how in the hell do the bells of freedom ring? Sometimes I wonder about our future in store, and if we'll still neglect the poor. We have so many people locked in cells, it's almost as if we're under a spell. Cast by our so called forefathers, and I seem to be the only one it bothers. For evolution will always take its toll, look back at how we burned the totem pole. Who will burn us and how will we know? Until we're allowed to run our own show. Everyone is so quick to judge, and even quicker to hold a grudge. Just because we all have different views, doesn't mean we cannot find a use. So even though this shit won't sell, when will we wake up and demolish this hell? Our constitution is all of our rights, but it is changed everyday in the supreme court lights. Who are they to decide the meaning? I think we all see to which side it's leaning. Leaning towards more control over us, I think about it sometimes so much I want to bust. So when I say this I will not blush, Why are we in such a big fucking rush? "
Tell me about yourself.,"I remember when asked to do this assignment, I was wondering if someone would actually really want to know my thoughts. I find it kind of hard to just type out all of my thoughts, considering that there are hundreds of random thoughts every minute(or it seems). Phones ringing. cell phones. yuck. Interruptions. I knew that would happen. I don't think I'm capable of having twenty minutes of silence to type something. All I know is that I am really really hot which will probably affect my thinking. I'm naturally a ""hot natured"" person, and my sister's room is really hot. So hot I'm sitting here sweating and I'm barely moving my body. My room is just as hot though. I'm just hot all the time. I wonder what affects it really does have on me. I know it makes me grumpy sometimes. Especially if I'm hungry at the same time. That's just a bad position to be in hot, sweaty, and hungry. No matter how low I turn are air conditioner, I'm still burning hot. Not to mention our electricity bill that makes me just as hot! But I guess I don't have any room to complain. I couldn't ask for anything more in my life. I have everything I've ever wanted and more! I accidentally meet my boyfriend and he just makes everything even better than it was. He makes me see things that I would have never seen before. He really has made a difference in my life. Thank you, thank you, thank you God. I wonder how my mom is feeling? Her surgery was last week, so I'm sure she doesn't feel as bad as she did. Since she was at work a couple days later, I guess she must not have felt too bad. But she is a strong woman the strongest woman I've ever known. I'm proud to say that. Very proud. I guess you kind of' start missing your parents when you leave for college and you're far from home. But I am lucky to have an older sister(who I live with) and I've always gotten to follow behind her, making her do everything first. That's made my life a heck of a lot easier. I do miss my bed and my dogs. Not to mention my home. But I'll be going home soon, so I'm ready to go. I'm ready to introduce my boyfriend to my parents and grandmother too. That should be fun! I know it will go well though. I also wonder if my sister's car will be out of the shop, because I wanted to leave earlier than my sister. She won't get out of class until 4pm and I was wanting to leave around noon. It just takes so long to get there. Grant wanted to ride with my dad when he goes on duty too. I guess I'll leave around noon anyway and not go into work. Ohwell. I'm broke as it is. Why not add to that?!? A couple hours of missed work won't hurt to badly. I do need the money though. I'm going to be eating well that weekend anyway. I'll have 2 meals a day! That's more than I can say now and the food I'll get there is a million times better then what I would have here. You really start to miss the little things about life sometimes it just takes leaving your home for a couple months to do that to you. Years. it's going to' be hard to be away for that long. But I guess it kind of grows on you after a while and you just don't realize or notice it. Hmm I wonder how long I've been typing. I have a lot to read. "
Tell me about yourself.,"its hard to think what comes in your head naturally when you're told to do it. I wonder what my pledge brothers are doing now. I was having fun. I should've gone to these classes more so I would know this was coming up. I guess skipping class for the band makes it worth it though. when is Chris going to move up here? I hope they don't make me depledge for the band, that's just dumb. its all michael's fault anyway. he's just pissed that he didn't pledge and now he's left out of everything. well that's not my fault. I hope catherine doesn't think I'm weird. I just figured I could ask her to the party cause most girls want dates. maybe she did want to go but who knows now? ill ask cat pat. whatever. i've fallen in love like 30 times a day since I moved in here anyway. I want to play my guitar. college is cool except classes get in the way. if I could just play my guitar all day, id be a happy man. besides, the only way we can consider ourselves growing in intelligence and intellect is when we realize more and more how ignorant we are. animals may not speak to each other in words, but they also don't kill each other for reasons other than food and defense. we do. that's a good thought. I need to put that into a song. we only get smarter when we realize how ignorant we truly are. maybe this paper will be worth a damn. ah well, I wonder if people are going to know I write all the lyrics to our songs? I bet they wont since Michael sings them all. its like the motley crue deal where no one knew that six wrote the words and Vince just sang em. he sucks at singing anyway. I hope he doesn't read this one, I should watch my language. whatever. man is bekker going to call or what? she gets all pissy that I haven't talked to her and now the first chance I get i've called and she hasn't called back. that's probably what she wants though, me to start thinking about her. oh well, she's hot. I which there was a way to write out these blank spots in my train of thought where I don't even know what I'm thinking about. I bet I do but the memory isn't there so I don't know by the time I'm about to type it. I guess I just put those blank spots into words though. good job matt. wow, only half way done. I wonder how my high school football team is doing. I can't believe I made it through that. adolf as my coach for three years?! that's amazing. I'm proud of myself, no one expected someone like me to stick with it. now all the older frat guys respect me cause I played against half of em and I never stayed down. hell, one of them walked on at UT. I wonder if I'm going to be spending the rest of my life challenging myself or if ill one day be secure in how I am. I wonder if I need to be using punctuation and capital letters. I bet his computer thingy is going to mark my paper as something to check cause it wont make sense with the punctuation and capital letters missing. whatever, hell read it and think I think I'm cool since I rambled on for 10 minutes about high school football. I enjoyed that class last time, I need to start going to class every day. damn matt, you're going to screw up college and you're smart as hell. this is why you're stuck home tonight with a twenty minute paper and an astronomy test both tomorrow. I bet I have something in Spanish but forgot. I've been to that class every time though. if every class took roll, I don't think id survive. weird that I never once skipped a class in high school. no detentions, aep, nothing. I was good as hell. I guess my mom working there influenced me at first and then it was just a habit once I realized I owned my mom so I never had any desire to skip. I guess now that the band has a chance to do something good cause were not stuck in Houston anymore I can skip. I see it more like this band is like another person having an internship at a law firm. they want to be a lawyer but their parents made them major in cooking or something. would they skip the internship for cooking? hell no, neither would I. I'm going to skip cooking. or class in general. I'm going to be happy dammit and I'm not happy unless I'm playing in the band. just hope my parents don't find out. maybe if I do well this semester then they wont watch as much next so I can put even more focus on music. who buys a ball of rubber bands? why is this ball here? why am I not on my own computer? why can't they just make it and ship it? this sucks man, johns going to start getting annoyed that I'm on so much. oh well, at least he's not here now. I can't believe he knocked my guitar over this morning. I can't believe I slept through my alarm this morning. I want to sleep. whatever I'm done with this. I'm going to study astronomy now. yet another class that's been avoided. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I just got back from your class, so I decided that I should start to type this paper. I am very happy with my classes, even though I feel like they are going to be rather difficult this year, especially my Calculus class. I have a hard time understanding what my professor is saying. I end up have to go home and teach myself most of the information. Well that's enough about school. I just thought about my exgirlfriend. I have very strong emotions about her. I know that she was my first love. But I also am so mad at sometimes. We had talked about me going off to college and we knew that it probably would work about, so we decided that we would date other people. From my experience this really does work out. The first girl that I dated after her was a girl from my waiting job in New Braunfels. I decided that I should tell my exgirlfriend, whose name is Genie, about the girl. This was a very big mistake. Genie came to the restaurant where I worked and caused a big scene. But this isn't the only thing that makes me mad. Things are totally different now that we decided to see other people. We don't get along and we can't talk to each other. I think women need to just make up their mind. They all act like want this perfect gentlemen that does everything for them, but when the actually get that they don't know how to treat it. Usually the go to far and try to take advantage of it and then the guy starts to despise the girl. I don't really wish that things were back the way they were, I just wish that we could still get along. I really miss talking to her. She was a person that I could tell everything to and still feel comfortable about doing so. I am lucky though, because I have a sister that I am very close to. She also goes to UT and she has been a very big help with getting me settled in here in Austin. She only lives a couple of blocks away from me and she is there for me whenever I need anything, as I am for her. This is my freshman year and I am already dreaming that college would be over. It isn't that I don't enjoy Austin or College, it is just that I am tired of school. I wish that there could be a step in your life that you could just skip, but that is impossible. I would love to just be able to be settled in to a good paying job, but since that will never happen I am prepared to work now to enjoy the benefits later. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Today I had my third day of classes at UT. It is still scary to walk around with so many faces that I have never seen before. I see all the older students and they are so confident in what they do and I keep thinking that one day, I will know lots of people on campus and not feel as intimidated as I still do. My parents still intimidate me even though I don't live under the same roof as them anymore. I have all these responsibilities and they are still checking up on me all the time and I feel like I must make them proud of me. I guess I will always feel that way. My mom once told me that she still feels like she has to do what her mother thinks is right, but she has learned to not feel guilty for a decision she feels is the best one. My boyfriend thinks I try to please to many people and I need to start doing what I want. I guess he doesn't know that I try to please him the most. He thinks he is not one of the people that makes me unhappy. He is older and he thinks he knows more than I do, but went to A&M so there is no way that is true. Most of my friends stayed in Austin, but some of by best friends went to far away places and I already miss them a lot. I live with three of my best friends from high school. My room roommate and I get along great and have been friends since we were five, and the other two I have known since we were eleven. So far everything is going well in our new apartment, but one girl has decided it is not her job to clean anything, and we are going to have to talk to her about that. Three people can take care of an apartment, but we would all rather not. She is just taking advantage of the rest of us doing it. She doesn't even offer to do dishes or cook, or go to the store, but she complains when she doesn't like what we have to eat around the house. She is eighteen years old and she is getting married in ten months and really feels like she is ready to make that kind of commitment. I know things worked out for my parents, but it seems like people were different back then. She is really spoiled and I think we need to put her in her place. She is a sweetheart, but I can't figure out why she won't wait until after college to get married. That is just going to be an extra load, and more obstacles. They won't have enough money for all the things they want and will fight because they aren't happy. When we try to tell her these things of course she doesn't listen. She is sure what she is doing is right. Maybe for her it is, what am I to say. I could never get married at this age right now. My boyfriend and I have been together for three years and have mentioned the possibility of it way down the line, but there is definitely not a seven thousanddollar ring on my hand. I also don't think I want to get married because I want to make sure that this is really the guy for me. My roommate has never even dated another guy and the first relationship she gets into she thinks she wants to marry the guy. I think one of my roommates feels left out because she is the only one of us without a boyfriend. She is the sweetest girl, but not all guys like her. She never complains about it, but I think maybe she is bothered a little. I know she will find someone at this school, though, it is very big and there are lots of fish in the sea. "
Tell me about yourself.,"A writing assignment that lasts twenty minutes doesn't seem like a difficult task, but as I sit here I can remember all the papers that I have written. I usually sit and stare at my computer or take breaks to read what I have written before I continue. I can imagine that this paper will ramble and go into amazingly different subjects. Right now I'm thinking about where I need to go to get on the bus to go to my boyfriend's apartment. I wanted him to come pick me up, but he didn't want to. I looked up the campus loop bus schedule and the metro bus schedule and my mind is just going over and over the maps, trying to figure the best routes to take. Today is in fact my second day of school at the University of Texas. I was initially excited to begin classes and leave home and not be in high school. Now, I'm more worried that I won't be able to succeed like I did in high school. Maybe I'm not so worried that I won't do well; I'm worried that it will be very hard and that I won't be able to pass the finals, which appear to be the biggest part of most grades. Today my chemistry professor said that any chemistry majors should not be in the class. Well, I'm not a chemistry major, but I am a biochemistry major, so now I'm worried that I'm in the wrong class. I've consulted the course schedule several times already to make sure I'm eligible for the class, and it appears that I am. Maybe I just shouldn't worry. I also worry that my professors will yell at me or tell me to leave the room. I'm basically a good student, and I usually don't disrupt the class. Sometimes, though, its hard to sit still and be quiet when you are sitting miles away from a professor and you are surrounded by other people that you are friends with. I guess its not really a big deal, but I don't like getting in trouble. I'm one of those people who likes to do things I'm not allowed to do, like drink, but once I suspect that someone might find out, I'll try to get everyone else to stop. I know it is kind of hypocritical, but I just don't like to get in trouble. The words I dreaded most growing up were ""Lisa, we need to talk. "" Whenever my mother said that to me, I just knew I had to be in trouble. I would spend my time raking my brain, trying to figure out what I did that she found out about that she doesn't approve of. Usually, it turned out to be nothing. I guess sometimes I worry about things that once left alone will turn out all right. About a month before going to college, I spent a day stressed and crying because all these things needed to be done. I guess I wasn't getting enough sleep and that made me more anxious or nervous, but I was crying about everything. It even made me upset that I didn't have my computer yet, and I wasn't leaving for college for another month. I just wanted to get my computer and make sure that everything worked and looked how I wanted it to. Plus I had a lot of things to do in August, and I didn't want to run out of time. It did work out, but I still became upset about it. I moved from worrying about my computer, which works fine, to worrying about my career. For the past couple of years, I've told everyone that I want to be a doctor. Now I'm thinking about how much school, and how much money that will cost. I can't even begin to imagine the debt that I will incur by trying to become a doctor. That made me want to look into other careers, but I don't like a lot of other things. Maybe I can wait until I graduate to worry about that, but that wouldn't suit my personality very well. I like to worry about everything. What I really like to do though, is to make lists. I love buying planners because I always write down my assignments. And I write what I have to do on Thursday and if I don't finish that day, I write it again on Friday to make sure I do it. I'm not that concerned if I don't complete my tasks, but I just want to make a list. My roommate just walked in and was mentioning how we haven't seen much of each other. I have been spending a lot of time at my boyfriend's apartment, but don't most people enjoy some time to their selves? Plus, my roommate likes to have complete silence when she studies, and I want to have music playing. It wouldn't be so bad, but she studies all the time. I understand about being a good student, but this course is so familiar to her she could have placed out. I guess I'm just used to studying if I need to in order to do well. I just can't understand people that have or want to study all the time. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I like this writing assignment. It seems easy. I know I'm doing this pretty early, but it's okay. I don't want to go to class tomorrow. My roommate is playing his music pretty loudly but I don't care because I do the same thing. I wonder if I set my alarm clock. 8:30 is way too early for me. I sure do type slowly. I can still hear my roommate's music. I need to pee, but I can't. I have to wait 20 minutes. This is getting boring. I'm not very thoughtful today. Maybe it's because I am tired. I may go to sleep early today, but I know I won't. I am so glad that I only have two classes tomorrow. My roommate is talking on the phone again. I'm very delighted that I got a cool roommate. Man, only seven minutes passed. I'm getting so tired and bored. My roommate just left. He sure does go out a lot. I hope he doesn't wake me up tomorrow morning. Home. I miss my house, my turtles, my mom, my dad, and my friends. I sure do have lots of electronics in my dorm. I wonder why dogs howl at the moon. Man that was sure random. My keyboard is pretty cool. I still need to pee. Gosh only ten more minutes to go. I am halfway there. My shoulder is starting to hurt. I wonder how many words I can type a minute. Gosh, I'm glad that I am using Word. I cannot spell today. I still need to get my course packet. I'll probably go tomorrow. This is weird. I feel like I am talking to myself, but it is kind of cool. I wonder how people just came up with computers. I am sure glad that I am living in a society with AC. I would so be sweating everyday. It's so hot here, but not as humid as Houston, that is a plus. I wonder if I am supposed to be writing sentences or not. Oh well, I only have five more minutes to go. I don't watch television as much as I used to. I need to start watching the news. I never know what's going on in the world. I don't even know the names of the presidential candidates' running mates. Gosh, I wonder how many words I have typed so far. This page is filling up. There are only three more minutes to go. Then I get to send this in. I wonder if you are going to read this. I need to stop my online slang for writing. My chair sounds like a fart when I move it. Oh oh, two more minutes, and then I'm done. That pretesting sure took a long time to fill out. One more minute left. Man, I lost my thought. I wonder how many seconds are left. My stomach is starting to make noises. There sure are a lot of underlinings in this paper. Woohoo, all done. "
Tell me about yourself.,"My thoughts I have never tried to write about my thoughts before, so here goes: I'm sitting in my dorm room just where it is quite hot for some reason even though the air conditioning is set for the coldest setting, oh well, I guess Dobie isn't perfect. My suitemate sure isn't any good. I hadn't seen him for the last two weeks, but as soon as I put a TV in the living room, he shows up. Lousy moocher. Now I have to listen to my headphones because he is watching some stupid movie. These things make my head hurt, and I don't like the music I'm listening to, stupid Backstreet Boys. My girlfriend loves them, I sure do miss her. She lives in Houston and goes to HBU, she is so nice. She isn't anything like the other girls I know, she never complains, and always does whatever I want to. I'm lucky to have her. I'm afraid that this long distance relationship thing won't work out. That would suck, I don't know what I would do. My head just hurts thinking about it, or is it just these tight headphones. They aren't even mine, they are my roommate's. He is a great guy, one of my best friends from Houston. He just got back from his girlfriend's dorm room. She lives upstairs, and that isn't fair. He gets to see her all the time, I only get to see my girlfriend every two weeks or so. I guess that could be good too since I need to study a lot. I have some big shoes to fill, both my brother and sister went to UT and they were both in the business school, which I couldn't get into. Sometimes I feel stupid compared to the two of them. My parents really want me to do well, and I hope I can make them happy. If I try really hard, and get a little lucky, I might be able to transfer into the business school. That would be cool. I feel sorry for my mom, and I am scared. She needs a liver transplant, and it isn't fair for her. She wasn't a drinker or anything, she lived a very good life. She just happened to have a bad liver. That's why I hate Mickey Mantle. One day a friend of mine was talking about how we should give free health care to everybody, but I totally disagreed. I told him that we shouldn't help the drunks and druggies, and he thought I was crazy. That's when I get really pissed and started yelling about how stupid celebrities like Mickey Mantle get to skip people on the transplant list, get a new liver and then drink through it. After that they get to take another one, then he died anyway, that is the only thing that made me happy. They could have given that liver to my mom, rather than some stupid lush who just killed it. Someone told me that he had a disease that he couldn't stop drinking, I say BS. He could have paid someone to walk around with him to make sure he didn't drink any alcohol, but my mom can't do that. She just has bad blood, if we could pay someone a hundred thousand dollars a month to follow her around and keep her healthy, we would do it in a heartbeat. We don't have that option. Well that's twenty minutes, I don't know if that was exactly what you were looking for, but that is pretty much what I was thinking, and that was pretty fun! "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am really tired right now. Yesterday, Nick (my roommate) and I went at 10:30 at night to Gregory Gym to lift. I really have to use the restroom right now, so I will be right back. Sorry, I feel much better. My legs are so sore. I wonder what happens in a person's brain to tell his/her body that he/she needs to use the restroom. This TV next to me is really big, and I would like to turn it on right now, but I have more important things to do, namely writing this assignment. It would preoccupy me. I am really stressed out right now because I have so much going on. It gives me a headache. What causes headaches? Psychology is going to be a really fun course. I type really slowly, and I am trying not to look at the keys, but I am not doing a good job. My teachers are all great, and I lucked out with my math professor. He actually talks English. I wonder who ever thought of pencils and how they work. It is an amazing thing. Girls are wonderful  they make so happy. I have to maintain at least a 3. 5 to stay in the Business Honors Program, but I can do that if I really set my mind to it. Joining a fraternity would be so fun, but they are so expensive. My bed looks really comfortable. I always wonder if what we dream happens in reality later in life. Deja vu is a feeling that I cannot explain. I have always wondered what happens inside the brain when this feeling occurs. I think that I have a slight obsessivecompulsive disorder because I want everything to be so neat and clean. I wonder if other people have this same feeling. I am always scared to talk about it in front of other people because I don't want them to think that I am weird. Who would have ever come up with the idea of the computer out of nowhere? They must have been brilliant. I feel a little lightheaded right now because I put a dip of Skoal Wintergreen Long Cut in my lip. I hope that I can quit soon because I have been dipping since my freshman year in high school. My back is a little sore. I wish that I could go to sleep now, but I have to read some MIS 310 stuff. Psychology is a huge class. It has 540 people in it, and that is 50 more people than in my graduating class at Spring High School last May. Well, it has been 30 minutes. Bye!  "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am feeling a little nervous right now. I just tried to find my class but it was not in the same spot as usual. Normally I wouldn't really care, but today this class was my excuse for not being somewhere else. I walked around for thirty minutes to three different buildings trying to find the whereabouts of this class. I never found it. Hopefully the fact that I was not in class will go unnoticed. I had a very busy day, and every little thing I do every day I have to think about twice. I can not react on impulse here in college, because if I do I could get into trouble with people I would rather not be in trouble with. If I do get in trouble it is not that big of a deal. I got my OU wristband today. I had to get up very early in order to do this. I was tired out from last night as well. I have to get up early again on Thursday in order to get my actual ticket. The OU tickets are thirty five dollars. This is pretty expensive. From what I hear it is worth it though. A lot of people have told me that this is the best weekend of the entire year. We're going to take buses to Dallas and probably stay the night at some of my new friends houses. It sounds like a blast. One of my friends from high school moved to Dallas to go to SMU for college. It will be good to see him. One of my other friends went to West Point for college. I respect the guy with all my heart. I don't know how he does what he does. I got to see on Labor Day for the first time in like three months. That was really nice. He does not think that West Point is that great, but he is the only one of my friends with enough self control to live through all that stuff. The beginning of college has been fun so far. I've had some great times, and some nerve racking ones. I enjoy living on my own. I live with three other guys from Corpus Christi. They are all really cool. I enjoy private times sometimes too. It is kind of neat when they all go to their fraternity deals, and I get the whole place to myself. It's a lot more quiet, and that is really nice sometimes. They spend pretty much every hour of every day with each other. It would be fun but every one needs a little privacy sometimes. I just got my internet connected today, so this is a nice new feature. Well it has been about twenty five minutes now so I am going to check spelling and submit my work. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Oh. I don't even have a clue about the purpose of this assignment. Will Professor Pennebaker use this writing assignment as some kind of test? Interesting approach! Oh. wow. I have Psychology this Monday. I wonder what we're going to cover. I still have to read chapter two. Too much homework and so little time! I wonder when mom's going to get home. Is she going to the grocery store again? I have to ask Monica about this. I really want some gum. I really wish that mom would get me some. Oh. this cricket is really annoying. Stop making that sound please! Is it already the cricket season again? Last year, I've seen about a hundred crickets, some dead and some alive, in front of Eckerd. Now, we have crickets outside of my bedroom window. Great! Wow. Monica has been watching the TV for a long time now. I'll give her fifteen more minutes and then I'm going to go turn off the TV. She should read more. Oh. I have to read my Biology too. I don't exactly want to read it. It's not going to be fun. I really want to go do something exciting so I can kind of clear my head up a little bit. I can probably ask dad to take me to the lake tomorrow. We can probably bring some food and have a picnic there. I really hope dad doesn't already have a plan. I have to ask dad, right away, when he gets home. Anyway, I have to start thinking about my schoolwork. I wonder how people can make perfect 4. 0 gpas. The must be really smart. I should study harder. I need to have better study skills. Oh. this Monday I need to go meet my Biology teacher. She's a really good teacher. I need to tell her that. This woman can really explain stuff. I should go look for the red folder and check for her office hours. I wish her office hour were somewhere from twelve o'clock to two o'clock. Ah. the crickets. the noise. this is really annoying. If this keeps on going, how am I supposed to sleep tonight? I really need lots of sleep. I'm really tired today. Wow. I can't believe I actually vacuumed the whole house today. I never thought I could have done this for just one morning. Amazing! I really want mom to get home soon. I wonder what we're going to have for dinner tonight. I really want chicken noodle soup. I also want some salads. Please get home soon. I'm hungry. Oh. thirty more seconds then I'm done with this writing assignment. If Professor Pennebaker read this he'll probably think that I don't have a stable mind. Ah. time's up. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Just sitting down and actually listening to your thoughts has become a rare event for most adolescents. I think it would be wise if I put myself on a quiet place and just thought about things such as my life, beliefs, and future. Today I went to a meeting for KVR News and received tons of information about the station and what I needed to do if I wanted to be apart of it. The meeting was extremely informative, almost too informative. My head was spinning by the time I left the station. I learned so much and that was only the tip of the iceberg. I feel as though I am behind in life right now. I'm definitely already behind in my schoolwork, but in other things too. I still feel as though as I am at camp not in my new home. My other friends already feel comfortable here. It also seems like there are numerous assignments and activities that I can't fit into a twenty four hours! I miss my best friend named Dana. She went to Tulane. She is doing well which makes me happy. Speaking of happiness, certain things in my life these days are causing me to experience extreme happiness. This is impressive because a year ago I was debating whether or not anyone could obtain true happiness. Now I am a firm believer. You see, about three months ago I met a beautiful guy by the name of John. He is intelligent, funny, artistic, and the best boyfriend a girl could ask for. This has been the longest not to mention the only serious relationship I have ever been in. John makes me feel pretty. He looks out for me and he loves me. When I am with him I am completely happy. Another strong catalyst to my blissfulness is food and the Jester Cafeteria has been coming through. Of course, I have to focus in quantity not quality! Whenever I eat there I get lost in the selections. So much to eat so little space! Though I reach these peaking moments of happiness, every once in a while they disappear. When I was filling out my pretesting questionnaire I started to feel depressed. All the questions were bringing up topics and ideas that made me think about how I handled issues. I'm not good at issues. I tend to bottle things up. I'm not good at verbalizing my emotions. This combination is dangerous. Sometimes I wonder if I have made wise choices. I wonder if my parents miss me. I wonder if my friends long to see me too. My selfconfidence is like one crazy roller coaster. One minute I am a gorgeous intellectual woman who knows what she wants and the next I am an ugly confused little girl who can't figure anything out. It is a good thing for me to acknowledge these things and occurrences in my life. I am very thankful for what God has given me. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I have so much on my mind right now. It seems as if my world is changing in every way from every aspect. I have been told by someone close to me (my ex girlfriend) that I have changed. She will not tell me what she means or in what way I have changed. It bothers me more and more all the time. I can't see how I have changed. I have looked at every aspect of my life and personality and have yet to find any feeling different than that which I felt three months ago. I don't want her to be upset with me. I just wish she would tell me why. I feel like I am continuously trying to make everyone around me happy. I spend so much time being the listener of other people's problems. I just sit there and listen to them and when they want feedback I provide it to the best of my ability. The only problem is that sometimes I want to talk to someone. But people do not usually seem to have the same time for me. I usually find my own way of dealing with things such as bowling. Bowling is great stress relief. You challenge yourself only and get to throw heavy objects at other heavy objects to improve your score. I am not a violent person at all. but I do feel better after a few games of bowling. I enjoy talking to people about things and helping them with their problems. It just seems like there are a lot of problems out there for which I have no advice to give. It's as if I am letting them down. I am somewhat worried right now. Mainly about what will happen when I finish this thought process. I have to go to my fraternity house and help work on one of our pledge class's projects. I am tired and feel overwhelmed by what I have to do. I have schoolwork, friends, and fraternity. Any one of these could easily take all of my time. Yet here I am trying to budget all of it in. I realize that schoolwork comes first, but I do not want to give up my fun time. I enjoy fraternity but it is a lot of work and takes a lot of time. Right now if I had one wish it would be for me to never need sleep again. That would give me another 8 hours to get my daily tasks done. I guess maybe I should think of some good things too. Life can't be all bad. I have met so many new people since arriving at UT. I have made friends with people whom I can already tell have the potential to be lifelong friends. College has been like starting over. I have friends who also came to UT. But I rarely see them. And those who I did not get along with, I have yet to see thanks to the incredibly large campus. This is probably one of the most interesting assignments I have ever one. It has been a very long time since I simply sat down and wrote my feelings. In fact, this is the first time since I arrived at UT that I have had the opportunity to think about how I really feel. I actually feel better knowing where I stand on some of the most important aspects of my life. I will definitely make sure to read this again. maybe in a day or so. I might even do this assignment over again on my own in a week or so to see if and how my feelings have changed. I need new shoes. I stepped in a deep water puddle the other day and soaked them inside and out. It is time for a new pair of shoes anyway. I actually saw a student walking to class without shoes the other day. I can't imagine walking down the streets of campus without shoes. Why am I thinking about shoes? What time is it? Only one minute left. I have really enjoyed this assignment. I hope the upcoming writing assignments are as interesting as this one has been. Time is up. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well I figured since I want to go to bed at midnight I would write for 20 minutes now so I don't forget. I always tend to think at night. Stuff runs through my mind because I let it wander. I don't know if this is a bad thing or a good thing, but I do it anyway. I just finished studying for a chemistry test tomorrow. It is my first college test so I am a little nervous. I know that I have to do well in all my classes in order to get into medical school. I think I will do fine though. I have done all that stuff before in high school. So far the largest difference I have noticed between high school and college is that the professor expects you to know what he or she is talking about. They don't explain things as thoroughly as they do in high school. Oh well I guess I will become accustomed to it. I don't mind the reading I have to do so that isn't too bad. I have met a lot of new people here and I like the college a lot. One thing I do want though is a girlfriend. I like this one girl but she has a boyfriend back home so it is kind of hard. I seem to be able to pick out the ones that have boyfriends all ready. I was in the same situation almost with one of my good friends that just left for the Navy. I say almost because she liked me also, but had been going on with her boyfriend for a long time. We were friends back in seventh grade but then she moved and we kind of kept in touch through the years and then on day she called and I hadn't heard from her in over a year. I told her that we had to get together and do something. So I went over to her house for spring break and we spent the next two weeks together. I had so much fun. I felt as though we were meant for each other. It is kind of hard to explain the feeling I had when I was around her. Well I told her and she said that she liked me too but couldn't break up with her boyfriend and then go out with me. I asked her why not and she said that she couldn't be with me and then have to leave for the Navy. I talked to some of my friends and they said that it was because she knew that I would not let her leave and her current boyfriend would. I don't know if that is it or not, but regardless we went out a whole lot and spent a bunch of time together. I always had a wonderful time with her. Then I left and then she left. I came here and she is in Chicago for boot camp. I miss her a lot. Then I met this one girl from my high school, which I knew but not that well. In the last few weeks we have become real good friends. She reminds me of my friend in the Navy, and I can't figure out if that is one of the reasons that I like her or not. I think it might play a bit of a role in it, but I am not sure. Well she has a boyfriend also so I am in the same position as before only I am not sure how she feels towards me. I received a post card from my friend in the navy today. It felt good to hear from her. I have to write her back tomorrow. Well it is midnight so I think I am going to head to bed. I know that I will continue to think through the night. That is just what I do. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I met this guy Mark Thursday and today we had breakfast together. I really like him, but I don't know how to express myself around him. I get a selfconscience feeling, but he seems excited when we talk. I have a nervous tick in my stomach when I think of him, like now. I feel like calling or emailing him, but I can't find the guts to. At breakfast, it took my five minutes before I could stop shaking. No one noticed but I could feel my knees quiver. School is not exactly what I thought it would be. There is so much reading, and I don't know if I'm absorbing it all into my brain. So many fun things to do, I make myself sit and read. I try so hard to focus on the page and words, but my mind wanders. I try to read ahead to be prepared for the next class, but I suffer as much failure as I do success. I have a club meeting tonight and tomorrow night and I'm lucky if I get the times and meeting places correct. I guess that's why I bought a cool UT planner which I carry with me everywhere! My mom was the same way I am. She procrastinated more in college than I am and did very well. I don't want to fail. I think about failing and it makes my stomach hurt and I zone out, pushing the thoughts of failure to the back of my mind, but they always pop out again. I miss the familiar faces and places of Port Lavaca. I miss driving my the bay in the evening and the sounds of the cottonwood trees in the front yard. Tears come to my eyes. I haven't cried in a very long time, not even when I came back from the long Labor Day weekend. When I talk on the phone with my parents I swallow the lump in my throat and hold back the tears. I want to succeed here and I'm am doing a good job of breaking the university into a smaller, less overwhelming place. As a little girl, I came to many UT football games. My dream was to be a student here. Considering I was in the top ten percent of my graduating class the task was not a hard one. I love the university and I'm glad I choose UT over Southwest Texas. Southwest does have the best Speech Pathology program in the state, but I can not see myself anywhere, but here. When I think of that the sadness goes away, but I'm still left with an incredible amount of work that I am trying to accomplish. My dad works very hard. He only went to college for two years, and then to work for the family company. I can't tell if he likes work. He almost hates his sister's husband. I don't like him either. A total jerk and I feel sorry for my cousins, one of whom only calls home when my aunt is there. I think my dad is happy. He always coached mine and my brother's basketball league games. He loved it. He was an average student in high school, most likely had ADD or ADHD. We've always been close, but sometimes I feel like he disregards my feelings. We're both athletic, but I got the heavier build of my mother and my dad is slender, but muscular. Sometimes my dad gets mad at my brother and I, but our mother tells us that he always feels bad afterwards. I hope he knows I love him very much. "
Tell me about yourself.,"This is my writing I always feel like everything should have a title. Somebody told me I was anal last night. I don't think so though. I've always thought myself to be rather easygoing. Church always made us be nice to people. That's another thing, people always tell me that I'm ""like the nicest person I've ever met!"". I don't see it. I may be easygoing but I do not consider myself nice. I think I'm just not mean so people think I'm nice. I'm not. You should see how I treat the men in my life. The poor boys don't have a clue. Marques hopefully will never find out because I actually do love him a lot but I just can't seem to settle down for anything. That's got to be some kind of mental deficiency don't you think. Oh well, around this campus I think I am one of the only sane people around here. I'm saying that like I think I'm sane. I don't think I am. I like William a lot too. He's so strong and ""Mr. Cool"" like. I'm always attracted to the strong cute ones. I guess it's some kind of complex about my tiny stature that I always go after big men. I can't believe Marques got up to almost 300 pounds this summer. He is really making me mad though because he is not helping my constant state of confusion that I have been dealing with lately. I hate typing. I don't have anything to say anymore. I wish I had a twinkie and a juice box. I do need to go to the grocery store. Eckerds is just up the street though so I'll go up there if I can ever get caught up on all my work. I am going to try to make it to the Delta party tonight. I think everybody's going to be there. I hope William is there. He's such a cutie and he likes me a whole lot. He gave me these two massive hickies on the sides of my neck. They look really bad and they kind of hurt too. Oh well, at least I've found somebody that I like. I wish Marques was here so that I could take my mind off of all these cute men. My nursing class is cool. Are you sure that you wanted us to just type whatever comes to our minds. Well, I don't think you want to get inside my mind. There's a whole lot of stuff that should not be open to the public right now. I guess everybody thinks like this though. I can't call myself different because sometimes I know that I am different. I don't think like everybody else I know. I think I'm a little bit on the crazier side than they like to think I am. Okay, I have been typing for 12 minutes now. I told you that I don't have anything to say. It's not like I don't write in my journal every night. I know how my mind works and I don't particularly like it. I happen to think I'm a little nuts, but who isn't. This isn't all about me though. I'm not the teacher so I guess I just have to sit here and type until your hearts content. That's what I'm here for. My mom tries to make people happy too much. She had to go to a craziness doctor a few years ago because she almost had a nervous breakdown. I thought it was funny though so maybe that's mean of me but if you knew my mother you would think it was funny too. She's not a very nice lady and she bothers me way too much. I wish she would stop calling and acting like that good little mother that she always want to be. She's not. I love my daddy. He called while William was still in the bed this morning. Not good. He kept tickling me and my dad was kind of getting suspicious but William plays too much anyway. I need to go take a nap and it's been more that twenty minutes so I'll talk to you later. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am so glad that I got some emails today. I love when people write me, and tell me what is going on in their life. It also makes me feel good when they ask me to do things with them. I really have a lot to do today. My bulletin board is just so plain. I have to get some color back up there, to make the room appear pretty. I love Texas football, I need to put my poster back up of the football team and schedule. I love the picture my friend sent me in the mail, now I can look at it everyday on my magnetic board. I wonder if my roommate will come back after her class, so we can go eat lunch. I am really hungry. I wonder what they are having for lunch. I need to go check my mail, to see if I got a letter from the company I applied for work. I really hope I get that job, it would be so fun, and I would have some extra spending money. All of these wires on my desk are driving me up the wall. I need to see if I can hide them some way. I need to hook my printer up before I hide all of the wires. People come in and out of this dorm all day long. It is funny all the different schedules people have. I wonder if that screeching noise outside ended up in a wreck. Austin traffic really scares me. People just don't care when they are driving. I have to be the observant one, when I drive tonight. These pigeons outside my window are really getting on my nerves. I hate that purring noise they make. How do they even make that noise? They are such big and ugly birds. Somebody must be taking a shower, because the water is running in the bathroom. What could be making that squeaky noise I hear, it is about every minute. Dorms have all kind of noises. I really like my dorm now, I just need to finish decorating it, since I had to take it down for the sprinkler installation. I worked so hard getting my bulletin board perfect, then I had to rip it down. Now I have the task of putting it all back up, like I had it. I can't wait until I have it back like I had it because the room was just so bright and vibrant, with posters and fabric. I wonder if my theatre teacher will discuss that play we went to see last night. I can't believe he went to the same one. I think it was a little too different for me. I am not really into plays that much, so can I grasp the plot of this one, in order to write a critique? I bet he will say something about it today in class. I can not wait to hear what he has to say. I love that class, it is so much fun. He is so energetic, I look forward to it each day I get to go. I wonder if I will see Shelly today. I hope I get to talk to her, she is a nice person. I am getting kind of worried about my roommate, she is not back yet. I really want to go to lunch. I wish the sprinkler installation would be over, because I can't take much more of this drilling. I don't understand why it sounds so close, I thought they were finished with the rooms around us. Maybe these walls are just really thin. I like wearing a hat, I think I will do it more often. I didn't have to fix my hair, it was great. The bells are chiming, I love that sound. Look it is over time to stop. I wonder if I am supposed to end this in a specific way. Oh well, I don't know what to do. This was interesting. "
Tell me about yourself.,"The first thought that enters into my mind is my parents, whom I have been thinking about since I left Houston for college. It's so different here, but not necessarily bad. I have always been under the protection of my parents. But here, I don't have anyone telling me when to get up and when to go to bed, and what to do. I literally make all my choices, which I have to admit, I don't always make the best decisions. I don't study when I know I should. Sometimes having a boyfriend means spending less time doing the things that I know I should, and doing things like going out and having fun. I feel like I should be studying instead of procrastinating until the last minute. But back to my parents, I feel that the college experience is just as tough for them as for me, because I am the last kid to leave home. My mom has been crying constantly and I know that she is lonely because she doesn't have me bumming around the house and eating her food. Sometimes I even feel sad because I now realize all the things my parents have done for me. Even though I thought they were always against me. When I think about the things they have sacrificed for me, I get teary. Especially when I think about the car that my dad just bought me a day before I left for Austin. I got an Acura Integra, nothing I had ever expected. I was so ecstatic and I had never gotten such a great present in my whole life. I know that my Dad had to sacrifice by paying more money for it than I had expected. And now I'm trying not to abuse any things they had given to me and before that I had taken for granted. I really miss my parents and sometimes I have trouble dealing with it. It's tremendously difficult to do things all on my own. My values are seriously getting tested because I don't have them to give me advice anymore. All I keep thinking is how much I love them and how I can possibly show my gratitude for them. College is a tough thing. Even though I went to an enormous high school, it can't compare to college. My classes are huge, and sometimes very monotonous and boring. Surprisingly, the class I had thought was going to be tough and boring, became one of my favorites, economy. Mainly because my professor, Hamermesh, is a great teacher. He is lively and so humorous. The other classes, I really don't care for much. One thing I do hate about college life is the roommates. I live off campus on Enfield, in a really nice apartment/condo. My dad bought it with the intention that I have a nice place to live. It is two stories, and I have been trying to decorate it the best that I can. But the problem is that I have to have roommates. One is this white girl, Karmin, who I never met. My dad posted a bulletin in a church up here in Austin, looking for a roommate and she applied. The other is a Chinese girl, Laura, I have known since I was a child. I share a room with Laura, so Karmin has her own room, and she pays a little more. However, I still end up paying more because it's not fair to split a 1200 rent 3 ways. So Karmin pays 350 for her own room, which I consider a good deal. Laura is really messy, which bothers the heck out of me. But lately, I have been dealing with it pretty well. Karmin is the most annoying and a constant pain on my mind. She is older and she thinks that she is the ruler over the household. But she is messy, especially in public areas and I am the one who has to clean up after her. And the thing that bothers me the most is that she is very stingy. She has a big tv in her own room, and vcr and then on the other hand, comes and watches tv that Laura and I own. So we are not allowed to use it. I borrowed her vcr the other day, and she asked me, ""When are you going to buy your own vcr?"" Still, she isn't willing to share but doesn't mind using our things. Same with the food. I really feel the need to tell her off, because she sure is getting a good deal living over here, and she can't have the right to treat this place as her own, she needs to respect us. Not only that, she hammered nails all up in her room, knowing that she is only living her for a year and it's not fair to the other person who lives in that room next. That's my biggest problem and whenever I talk about it, I feel really agitated and stressed. Well, all I feel now is relief though, because my 20 minutes are up!  "
Tell me about yourself.,"It is 1:39pm and I have decided to use my break between classes to tackle this writing assignment. I am not even in my dorm because my we ordered my computer and it hasn't come in yet. I am typing this from my friend's computer. She lives two doors down from me at the Dobie Center. Life is a really funny thing because it is so unpredictable. For example, three weeks before school started I was in a really bad car wreck. In the accident I broke my patella from the impact of my knee crashing against the dash. I have been in a brace to immobilize my knee and crutches ever since. So now I have to crutch around campus. it's terrible. I am having a really hard time writing this paper because there are no rules or criteria. I absolutely hate having no outline, it drives me crazy. I am the kind of person that needs very specific and detailed guidelines. Otherwise I panic because I not sure if I am doing is exactly what is expected. My classes so far seem really fun. All of my professors are really interesting and down to earth. My one concern is on Monday because I have two classes back to back that are on opposite sides of campus. I can't believe that I am on my own. My parents have been such a major part of my life because of snow skiing injury. My freshman year of high school I hit a tree while skiing and broke my femur. The brake went through my growth plate so I had major complications. I was completely dependent on my parents for everything. I couldn't walk, carry things, or even sleep through the nights. I've had 8 surgeries on my leg and I have been homebound from school for half of a semester. When I was homebound I had so much time to think about anything and everything. The main thing that I concentrated on when I was home was learning how to roll with the punches. I am an extreme perfectionist, which makes me very uptight about every little detail. Most people would assume that it is a good quality to be a perfectionist, but I beg to differ. A perfectionist gets so overwhelmed by the tiny mistakes that he forgets to look at the big picture. As a perfectionist your job is never finished because there is always something that could be improved. It's a terrible quality, it really is. My roommate is not really a perfectionist, but she is a neat freak so that is good. I am so lucky that I got paired up with such an awesome roommate. Her name is Lorie, and I love her to death. Its almost like we are the same person. We hit it off right from the start. What I like about college is that you aren't penalized for being yourself. In high school I was often accused of being fake. Sorry that I am a really friendly girl and I try to get along with everybody. College is such a big step in life, I feel like I am starting a new life almost. My three fiends from home are going to school here and they have an apartment at Melrose. I feel like they are my family now. They are three really great guys that I graduated with. I make sure their house stays clean and their schoolwork is taken care of. In return they make sure I am taking care of my knee and that I don't get too stressed out. It is such a warm feeling to know that someone cares about you. I think it is so important to show someone that you love them everyday, and to know that you are loved everyday. I was raised in a very affectionate family so that is what I am used to and what I need to get me through each day. Well the timer just went off, twenty minutes is up. I look forward to a great semester with you. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well right now it's 10:50 and I am thinking I'll be out of here in about twenty minutes and then I'll get something to eat, I feel very hungry it is probably because I didn't eat much last night or this morning, anyway I just remembered I have to cut the grass today what a pain. by the time I get home I am going to be so tired that I would just want to go to bed but no I have to cut the grass I guess I should forget about going to the gym today even though I promised myself I will go to the gym every Tuesday and Thursday. but o well at least I don't have to work today thinking about work I remembered there is that boat party next weekend that should be a lot of fun I haven't been to the lake for couple of months now, we used to go every week. it seems like a long time but it has only been about 6 minutes that I have been writing. I wander if I should return my study guide for calculus. I don't know if I need it or not. I am sure it will come in handy when doing homework but it is not required to have and it costs. I don't know maybe 40 dollars. It makes the job easier but at the same time I have to learn and try instead of just copying off the study guide. that was pretty nice of that guy giving me his psychology book for free I don't even know him. I was willing to pay half how much he paid for it but o well I probably should give him a gift card of some sort. Maybe I'll get one from work like a 30 dollar gift certificate. I feel kind of dizzy. I went to sleep late and then I had to wake up at seven to catch the bus and get here for my 8:30 discussion class to find out that they just covered the problem that I had questions about. and now I have been here at the lab for couple of hours string at screen doing my assignments for my computer science class. My eyes are getting pretty tired and the screen is becoming harder to focus on. I don't think this is good on my eyes definitely not. Well so far sitting here doing this has been the most fun I have had so far today, but still I just can't wait to get out of here. But hey where am I going to go? go to the bookstore and return the book? Or go to library and study for my macroeconomics class? maybe go to the gym ? no I am hungry I probably should get something to eat I don't know if I should call Vivian see if she wants to go get something to eat but she is probably sleep. I could call Lisa, I have to call somebody because I hate eating by myself. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Okay. So I need to write what's on my mind. Right now all I can think of is that chemistry test I just took at 9:30am this morning. It was my first test in college I was scared as hell before I took it because I was scared I would run into problems I didn't know how to workout and I would not pass the test. Now I'm sitting in anxiety for the results. I keep going to the site to see if the results are posted yet. I have butterflies in my stomach. I'm trying almost anything I can think of to get the test off my mind, one of my choices being going ahead and doing this assignment, but it only makes me more anxious. Goodness I feel so behind in my classes and I don't know why I mean I have work to do, but they aren't due for a while and I got time to relax, but can't. Again that stupid test is on my mind. Why does it torture me so? I'm sitting here praying I will get an 'A' on it because I gave it the best shot I could have even if I had studied continuously the whole week, I wouldn't have been able to do better. I guess partially out of regret for waiting to study until the night before, but there wasn't much material to learn and there was nothing new on it for me. The entire thing was a review for me from chemistry II my junior year. My stomach is in huge knots and I feel scared for some odd reason now it's like some sort of intuition or warning signs are going off inside of me bad warning signs and I don't like it. Those warning signs usually mean I'm in trouble for something, but I don't know why yet why I could be in trouble. I hate not knowing things. It makes me feel so vulnerable and I hate being put on a spot like that. My gosh I hope I didn't fail the test, otherwise I'll be in so much trouble it's not even funny. I just relaxed my shoulders and they hurt now from being so tense. I wish I could relax right now. Maybe I'll go work out to release some of my stress as soon as I'm through typing this assignment I still have 9 more minutes according to the clock. Man, I really hope I run into Siddharth today again that boy is really cute! But one thing puzzles me does Alvin like me? He always notices me and waves, but last night, he was like with me for a long time and kept saying how everyone is going to think there is something going on between us BULL CRAP THEY WILL! I think he wants me to think that they already do and might as well go with the flow the way he was hinting it. Man! that test, but it's not that anymore I feel like I'm in trouble and I don't know why is everything okay at home? I sure do hope so. Why do I concern my self so much everything will be okay no? Hey! need to write my cousins I really don't feel like writing Sonu now, I'll write him over the weekend when I go home. Man I've gained so much weight it's not even funny. but anyways my 20 minutes are over I hope this assignment is long enough I don't want to get in trouble for quantity this assignment is so weird and it scares me you just write what's on your mind I've never done that I've always had to think what I write and it's terrifying because any minute I feel someone is going to jump and say its wrong and I'll get a zero. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now I have a serious feeling of relief. It is the night after my first day of college, and it feels nice to be home. My legs are tired. I miss my dog and my boyfriend. I wonder what he is doing right now. I hope I am doing this right. I guess there is no right or wrong when it comes to my thought process. I guess it just happens the way it wants to. I hope that I can get back into the whole school ""flow"" again. I hope that I can get into it enough that I can get into the business school. I can feel you laughing at me already. Everyone seems to think that I can't do it. I know I can. I will. My mind is blank. I am so worn out. I haven't walked so much in one day than I did this afternoon. I hope I am not sore tomorrow. I need to find out where I need to go in the morning. What time do I have to wake up? My class is at nine thirty. Great! Why hasn't my boyfriend called me? He was supposed to an hour ago. Wonderful! Oh, I have to call my mom. I wrote a check today that I have to tell her about. How much was that thing? That reminds me. I have to set up Telesys tomorrow. Just one more thing to add stress to my day. I should work on my typing. What is that noise? I need to take a shower. Maybe I will wait until morning. I should call all my friends back home to give them my new house number. I wonder how college life is going for them. UT started late this year. Thank God! I don't feel rested, still. What time is it? Five minutes to go. I feel like my mind is blank. Whenever I try to ""hear"" what I am thinking, the only thing I end up thinking about is trying to think. That made absolutely no sense. I'm hungry. I really need to be more open. I've gone all day without meeting anyone new. I need to work on that. Oh, time's up. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now I'm sitting here at the computer wondering what I'm going to type for the next 20 minutes. There is someone outside in the apartment complex fumbling with their keys, perhaps trying to open their door. My computer is making some noise, and the apartment is really quiet so it seems very loud. I keep on making typing errors which is getting very annoying! There is a lot of stuff on my desk, I need to clear it off. I also need to clean up the kitchen cause there are lots of dishes that were left there last night when a couple of my friends came over last night. I forgot to get batteries for my walkman at the store yesterday too. I need to study for chemistry because I have a quiz in there at 12:30. I tried to last night, but I kept on getting distracted. I don't feel like doing this right now. I want to go to sleep. I just got back from calculus, which was an 8:00 class, and all I want to do is sleep. By the time I get the chance to, it will be time to leave again. I can't think of anything to type. I want to light a candle. I have a lot of time left and I still need to write. I'm not sure what about though. This weekend I'm not sure what I'm going to do, but I guess I'll have fun. I did last weekend. I need to do some reading for my classes, and I can't wait until this day is over because my weekend can begin due to the fact that I don't have any classes on Friday. Right now I am thinking about different things we can plan for my best friend's surprise birthday in Houston. We plan to have a party here for her too, but the one in Houston will be a surprise because she has no idea that me and Dag are planning it. Next weekend I am going to the UT Houston game and then right after that I plan on going home because the 24th is my Dad's birthday and the 21st is my brother's birthday. That will be a busy weekend. The following one is my friend's birthday. My computer is still making some annoying noise. I can't think of anything to type. I have 10 minutes left of typing. Hopefully I can come up with something for these remaining 10 minutes. I'm glad my apartment is on the 2nd floor because I noticed that yesterday when it rained that one of the apartments on the floor below had a puddle of water right in front of the door. That would be very annoying to deal with, if I lived there! So I'm glad I don't. Yesterday there was a lot of traffic. Today I get out of school at 3:30 and I have a trig review class at 5:30. I wish I didn't have to go, but I get extra credit for my calculus class, which I figure I will need. I need to balance my checkbook. I think I'll do that when I finish typing this. I'm going to listen to some CD's when I finish this too. I don't feel like studying, and I guess I'll have to figure out what to have for lunch. I wonder if the water filter we got makes the water taste different, I'll have to check that out in a minute. My desk is really cluttered, I need to get some envelopes and stamps, and mail those thank you letters that I keep on forgetting about. Well, I have a lot more stuff to do than I thought! It's driving me crazy that I keep on making so many typos, I never have this problem. Wow, I've finally written enough to start scrolling on the page! That's kind a cool. I thought that a I would have written more in 20 minutes though. I guess not. Surprisingly the time went by very quickly, I didn't think that it would. I guess in a minute I will log on so that I can get on to the psychology website and send this in. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I would guess the only thoughts in my head right now are on weather or not I doing the things I should be. Is the sorority right for me? I really don't like my pledge class that much but I like most of the other girls in Alpha Phi. I don't know I'm just so afraid that I've totally missed God's plan for my life. It worries me. What if Pharmacy isn't where I'm supposed to be. I love listening to people's problems and just being there to help them but I don't know what to do with that. Where are my thoughts headed I'm not exactly sure I let my though wonder lots of times and they just kind of go in every direction. Sometimes the end up to will I ever find the guy I'm supposed to marry? I really do wonder that sometimes. He has to be out there somewhere but where? I don't know. I hate watching Emily and Justin. Its really kind of stupid but its not that its stupid its that I want that too. That guy has to be out there somewhere and I just haven't found him yet but I always want a boyfriends it just seems like lots of time I have bad luck finding one. And it seems that everyone here has one all the freaking time. Its annoying I want to find that Christian perfect guy out there for me. Maybe it is Chris but I doubt it. We're just way to different. I don't know. Its crazy being here at college things are so different. I don't know exactly where I'm supposed to be. Hopefully I'll find it soon. I like the things I'm doing but something's wrong. I have doubts anytime I'm not doing them if that what I'm supposed to be doing but then I'm with those people and I have a great time. It's really confusing. I just need to find that close best friends that I haven't quit found yet. And I really can't wait for next summer its going to be a blast. I think God is putting me there for a purpose but what it is I'm not sure. I just can't wait. I just hope by that time I'll know what it is I'm supposed to be doing here and be totally happy. Its like I feel sometimes I'm putting on a show. It's weird. I hate that I'm kind of in a group who went to high school together. It makes it really hard to fit in. I just need to find my group but hopefully I have now with joining Hyde Park. It'll be all good. Its weird I think that with all the moving I've done it changes things here because I'm used to being on my own and finding new people but it seems so far everyone does stuff with people they already knew or stuff. It's weird. I can't wait though to see some of my old friends. It'll be great fun I miss them lots but then I don't either. I just need to find my new group its what I've been waiting for for a while now and I know that group includes a boyfriend. I guess I'm more ready to find that guy than I wanted to admit. Its not like I'm ready to get married just to find him and start getting to know him better. I just want to find my best friend and that best friend will be the man of my dreams who I will marry and I guess I'm just being impatient to meet him. Very quickly. Because it'll be so neat to find him. I can't wait for tonight because I""LL BE going back to church and that's always fun its my favorite thing to do. It's a good thing. And I don't want to go home this weekend but I know I need to so I'm not to happy about that. Its really weird as I am wiring this I'm seeing more into me of feelings that I've tried to hide but I guess are there more than expected. Its funny I don't know what I'm looking for but I need to find it. I have God and I really want to deepen my relationship with him tremendously. I think I'm on the right path for that. I'll get there soon. I just don't know when. I'm so glad though that I found my church home that makes me feel lots better. Really it does. I just know I have a home now. And my Impulse group is great. I know that will be tons of fun. I just can't wait until Wed when we have it again. I think that will be something I'll look forward to each week because its so much fun. And I think I will get along with my group very well. I really miss my grandma lots. She was like my best friend last semester and I could tell her anything. It was nice and I still can except she doesn't write me long email back. I wish she would it would make it better. But that's ok she's still getting the hang of the Internet. Some day she'll learn how to use it and become a pro. I know she will. I hope there isn't anything really wrong with her leg. That wouldn't be good. I'm sure there's not but you never know and she loves to hide it form everybody which is bad because what if there is something really wrong. IT doesn't do any good to hide it from everybody. She didn't let my grandpa do it so why should we let her do it? Not fair and it won't happen. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I woke up this morning and my words from last night at 1am, ""Can I have a 6 piece chicken tender and small fries to go"" echoed in my ears. I felt guilty. Within five minutes of ordering I had scarfed down the whole thing. Although my body wasn't hungry, I was thinking about food and I started to have major cravings for something filling. I sent myself on a mission to quench my thoughts, not my stomach. Is it normal to eat when you think about food and your body isn't hungry? Does thinking about food imply that you really are hungry even though your stomach isn't growling? This also brings up the issue of will power. I usually have strong will power, but with food it is another story. My body feels weighted down by guilt today. I went to Tops the other day to look at pictures and I looked fat in all the pictures I saw of myself. I'm sure every freshman promises themselves that they won't gain the dreaded ""freshman fifteen. "" I refuse to believe that it is an inevitable event in my life right now. I know how to avoid gaining the weight; exercise, eat healthy food, and above all, don't have late night snacks. My will power crumbles late at night when I see food or if my belly doesn't have that full feeling. Getting out of bed I could feel the unused calories building up in my body. I didn't eat breakfast and went to the gym where I worked out for almost two hours today in hopes of burning off last night's calorie fest and hopefully today's too. When I returned to my room I was in a bad mood, felt very lonely and as I told my mom, ""I'm not feeling like myself. "" I was depressed. I only felt good about myself today when I was exercising. I wanted to go eat lunch, but I felt guilty about even thinking about eating. I love to eat. It brings me satisfaction, comfort, and pleasure. However, my body image tampers with my enjoyment. I am not over weight but I feel like it. As strong, smart, and confident as I am about myself and who I am, I have been sucked into the belief that I ought to be skinny. It is amazing how easily my mood depends on my eating habits. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, today is my second day as a freshmen at UT. My fist class was at 9:30 in the morning and it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I thought I wouldn't be able to understand the professor at all, but surprisingly I understood him very well and I understood what he was talking about. It was a review over stuff we were suppose to have learned already, and it was all so familiar to me. I guess I really did learn something last year in Calculus. I did have a really good teacher and I did well on the Calc AP exam. I have to remember to write a thank you note to my high school professor. He was the coolest. He was so passionate about what he was teaching and he really got me into what he was discussing. I understood it very well and actually enjoyed it too. I wish I had teachers like him in other subjects I took in HS. M economics teacher was not to good. It was an AP course too and I really felt that I didn't learn much. Now I'm going to take an economics class in college. I hope I get the same relaxed feeling as in my business Calculus class. The professor seems pretty cool. And maybe others in the class had not so good teachers too, so they are at the same disadvantage as me. Either way I'm going to study hard and stay on top of things in my class, so I can eventually do well. If there's one thing I learned in High School, it's to stick with it. Starting out in high school, all I wanted was the easy way out, because the experience was so overwhelming to me and it was too scary. But at the end I started to see the big picture that in the end it is all worth it. In the end I will get a good grade trough all the hard work I put forth and then I can have that satisfied feeling that I did good and all my work paid off, so I must continue it. So I got in the habit of working my hardest and hoping to see the good result that are so satisfying to see. I usually get to see those results I so desperately work for but if not I work even harder the next time so I can finally see the results I was looking for. My High School was extremely competitive and I managed to keep up and just make it in the top ten percent. I'm very proud of myself, and where I am today. Many hispanic females such as myself with the same background are not as fortunate as me. In fact, most of my girl friends are working or going to a community college where I just don't see as much as opportunity as that which will be revealed to me at the UT Business School. Already I've been hearing in some of my classes that students tried out for the business school but didn't get in. That makes me feel so proud and honored for the position I am in. Other students have told me how hard they are trying to get into the business school. Again, I realize how lucky I am. I can't see myself majoring in anything else besides Business, maybe psychology, but that would be it. Psychology was my second choice for a major. I was that close to being a psychology major. So, now I know it was meant to be. I've had an accounting internship already, and I 'v e been to numerous business programs, which I have enjoyed very much. It brings me so much joy to say that I just may have found my niche because I know that this major includes all things that I enjoy. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Today has been a pretty good day, I guess. It's Thurs. , so it's closer to the weekend, which always makes life feel better, for one reason or another. I've had a lot of homework, and I know that the fun is only just beginning. I hope that somehow I will be able to keep a healthy balance between social life and school life. So far, I honestly think I've been spending more time studying and reading for class than doing anything else. My dorm floor seems kind of rowdy at times. I just wonder how all these people can just go out and hang around and do all this stuff all the time. Don't they have homework, too? I wish that I was just really really really smart so that I wouldn't have to work so hard to understand things, especially things that seem relatively simple to many other people. I went to the SI group for Psychology today, and I really liked it, although we didn't cover much class material, considering it was our first SI meeting. However, I like the small atmosphere, and I like Anna. I think that if I have any questions, it will be easy to have them answered then. I'm starting to worry about not making new friends and stuff. I guess it will all work out in time and I'm just feeling insecure for no reason. I would like to have someone to go to the game with Sat. (today is Thurs. , Sept. 7), but my closest friend here has to work, and I haven't met anyone that I feel comfortable enough with to go together. Oh well, that will all work out, too, I suppose. I kind of like this writing thing, because it's like writing in a journal, and I think it's healthy to write about feelings and such. Sometimes I wonder what I'm supposed to be doing with my life in general. I'm undeclared in school, and I have no real idea of what I should do with my life in the future. Certainly one day I will recognize that I have a specific purpose to serve. I would like to figure that out, soon, though. Tonight I'm going to Starbucks with my roommate. We grew up together. I really like mocha and caramel frappacinos. It's really interesting to me how popular coffee drinks are now. We had a discussion about this in my sociology class. It's such a trend right now. I'm starting to get tired of writing, now. I have that irritable feeling where it's just almost miserable to sit here and do this. Well, it's really not that bad, actually, I just want to get this over with. check it off my list of things to do. My family misses me! They're very proud that I'm here, though. I hope that I can continue to make them proud. I guess that all depends on the tests. I don't even know what to expect. I just pray that I won't do that terribly bad. I'm definitely going to do my best. Okay, six more minutes. Do you know how long six minutes is when you're sleeping and about to get up? I cherish those last few minutes in bed, really I do. My mom called me this morning about forty minutes before my alarm went off. That was annoying, but luckily, I had no problem falling asleep again. I can't believe some people that have worked at the University get paid only $20,000 a year in some cases. That's incredible. I'm not sure a strike is appropriate, because students are paying money to be taught, but still I was shocked to hear that from Prof Pennebaker. Girls keep screaming down the hall and I feel like I'm nine years old at summer camp. That's weird. I've been thinking about the advantages and disadvantages of living on campus. I'm thinking that it would be easier to study if I lived off campus, but easier to get involved by living on. Maybe next year I'll try getting an apartment and see how that goes. Well, my time is almost up. Bye. "
Tell me about yourself.,"My life is an out of control freight train. I know not where I am going or how I am going to get there. Throw a match upon me and I could combust or possibly extinguish the flame, which you so eagerly tried to ignite. But for what reason do you do this? I hold the answer to so little, so it is to you that I pass the question. Why am I all of the sudden asking myself why? I know where I came from but does this mean I cannot know where I am going? On I travel into the world unknown, uncontrolled by arms of mythic proportions. This gyroscope of time has hurled many an uncertain soul into its path with unrelenting mercy. This is why I am grateful that I do not have to face the world alone. My life is full of love and hope. My hopes of myself are to touch some person the way I have been inspired by many a magnificent soul. This ring of stupidity, which we call life, is taking place in a common fashion and I can see through your blurry sight. And I can see through you! Your rules mean nothing to me and mine. I live a life of loyalty, true to myself and my own. I draw so much upon my music that I sometimes misinterpret fiction for fact. My life is one long song, sung by the most gifted beings. "
Tell me about yourself.,"That is what I feel I should do first, is give you my social security number to make sure I get the grade for this assignment. Good thing this assignment is based on completion because at the rate I type I do not type much in the time span of twenty minutes. I guess since just in my class alone there is on estimate 550 students in there all of which will be turning this assignment in this week sometime, it makes it practically impossible for you to read through everyone's writing even with the help of your teacher's assistance. You never really think about how many thinks and thoughts run through your mind in just the coarse of a few minutes. Your class schedule for that day, what assignments you need to get done, people you want to hangout with, and even the decision of if you want to do any of these things will cross your mind on a normal day of class with out you really even notice yourself thinking about these things. Baseball has been on my mind for the last few days especially. I have been trying to decide if I wish to play of the Longhorn Club Baseball teams. While on this Thursday I have a tryout for the University of Texas Baseball Team. I guess I figure that I will see how the tryouts go for me on Thursday and make my decision. I really want to play for the UT baseball team but if that does not workout then the Longhorn Club team will be the next best thing. I honestly have a good feeling about my talent and the way the coach sounded on having a good opportunity on making the team as a walkon. Right now just thinking about it gives me a adrenaline rush. Just think if I made it how exciting every game would be. It is a trill just watching a football game just think about it if all those people are in the stands and your apart of the team! Well my time is up so have a nice day. Travis Johnson "
Tell me about yourself.,"Today has been a pretty uneventful and boring day. I've been to two of my three classes today. I was starting to fall asleep in my stats class. It's my most boring class of the day. I still have to go to my Rhetoric class. It's pretty boring too. I'm not a very good writer at all. I don't much enjoy going to class. I don't apply myself to school near as much as I should. I say I'm going to study but then I put it off until the last second. I guess there are a lot of people that do too. I'm pretty bad though. I don't study hardly at all and make B's and C's. I don't fell stupid for making sub par grades but I do feel stupid for not studying and trying. Then I could get all A's and B's. I'm a pretty laid back guy. Things don't bother me very easily. but when they do, I can't get them off my mind until their resolved. I live with three other guys. They can be idiots sometimes, but for the most part they're pretty cool. I have a girlfriend that I've been with for a year and a half. We don't fight very much. She gets mad at me a lot more than I get mad at her. She never use to get mad at me. But then a few weeks before I moved down to Austin she started. I think it's because she had stay home and finish school and I got to come down to Austin and experience new things. I feel that I don't love her as much as I use to. My twenty minutes is up so I'm going to go to English. This wasn't as bad as I had thought it would be. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I guess I'm just supposed to write what I'm thinking right now. I love listening to music. I guess it releases some kind of hormone or something that can just totally change my mood. If I'm sad about something, which would most likely have to do with my boyfriend or my parents, I can listen to a song and it will totally relax me and make me feel so much better. It should a kind of therapy  I think that they have already made that up  musical therapy. One of my friends from high school that is going to University of North Texas is majoring in that I think. I really miss Michael. He's my best friend and my boyfriend all in one. I can't wait to talk to him today  I've already done all of my homework for today and I don't have any more classes today. Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays are my hard days. I had a rhetoric class that I was taking but I'm not anymore because the professor gave a really sour first impression  she didn't seem happy at all to be teaching. I think that that's sad when someone doesn't like their job. I want to be happy when I'm older  I want to be a child psychiatrist. But as of right now, the psych department isn't accepting any more psych majors so I'm going to have to wait on that one. I want to continue to medical school, but I don't know where I want to apply for that. I have a couple of years to think about it though more than a couple. Oh  My favorite song is on  one of those songs that you just want to turn up really loud. Okay I have ten more minutes. Okay, my shoes are too small! Have you ever had a pair of tennis shoes that are too small? It really is painful  I hope my feet aren't still growing because they are already a size 8 and a half and a 9 would make me look like I have clown feet. If you have size 9 feet I'm sure you don't look like you have clown feet so don't take it the wrong way. I'm just talking about me. I hate the people who walk around college like they are cooler than everyone else  you know they probably thought that they were so cool in high school. Maybe the star quarterback or the head cheerleader. But who even cares about that stuff now. Not me! But that's okay. I took an AP Psych course last year in high school and I loved it. It's what got me interested in Psychology in the first place. I was going to be a photojournalist. But after taking the psych class I decided that I really enjoyed that a lot more than photography. Photography is great as a hobby though, but not to make a living. I also was watching a show on TLC on a family vacation to Canada (dad's idea) and it was an ER show and I really thought that was interesting. I can be easily inspired. Okay my time is up. "
Tell me about yourself.,"What should I write for this assignment. If I write what I'm thinking at this moment a lot of people's feelings could be hurt and I really don't care to share these thoughts with a faculty that I know nothing about. My mother is approaching me, maybe she wants to talk with me. No, she stopped short at her purse. No, wait, she's coming over here. She asks me a question about my homework, something trivial. I don't think she can read my handwriting even though she's sitting right next to me and that's good because I wouldn't want here to read this piece of writing. Wait, she is reading it! I quickly lift up the pages to take them out of her line of sight. It's cold in this room, but it's only cold on one side. O course, it feels that way because I'm sitting beside a vent. It's so weird to sleep on the sofa, people can be replaced so easily! I've watched two people accomplish the task with much agility. Funny, I wish I could type fast enough to keep up with my thoughts, but they fly by too quickly. I wish this person in the room with me would ask me where I live, I think the answer would surprise her. What's the time, 10:40? I've gone over my time limit. How should I end this entry, would goodbye be appropriate? "
Tell me about yourself.,"ok its 1018. here I go I feel like I'm the bum in waiting for godot. just write continuously, ha I keep messing up I can't keep up wait her I go there are my typing skills or not I wonder how I should take over the world I keep building up my bases on alpha centauri but the drones keep rioting its always on the bases that were conquered why don't the other leaders realize that drones aren't as efficient as people. if any of the other leaders attacks me I'm going to have more trouble this time because my military is outdated, but hopefully it wont be to them my tech is still ahead but I don't know how far ahead. I guess Emily's leaving about now, she's naive sometimes what's it like at this mixer its where a bunch of frat guys hit on you what a match its when whichever one hit on you successfully tries to get you drunk and take advantage of you I can't believe there's a theme, I thought we grew out of it in high school. I don't like the idea of some of the things she wants to do I don't know if she's naive or if she's pretending I don't think it would be as big a deal if had pledged this semester in some ways I like it but in a lot of others I really don't it surprising to hear blake pledged, I don't know if he wants to be friends,,. ,. friends. I wish had some. I'm getting to know more people like in my study group but everyone here seems to have their own agenda. its harder making friends than I thought I thought more people would be looking to make friends. the guys next door are in a fight I bet its about that time when pot luck people decide if they're going to get along, I don't like my roommate, but at least I already found someone to switch with he's always on my computer when I get home, he jumps up like I wont know that just implies guilt or hell try and explain, its just annoying he's supposed to get one man. I'm not a very fast typist I better get better if I want that secretarial job. I wonder what everybody's doing tonight I wish I had more friends like me. I need to remember to get my shots tomorrow. I'm running out of things to think about all this thinking is making me tired, well there's the answer to your survey, thinking makes you tired and since stressed people get less sleep they're more tired so I must be more stressed right, wrong that's getting an explanation from correlation, you can't do that, see I get this stuff I don't want to have to relearn the brain, I already did that in bio in high school, o wait I ran over the time, I'm done "
Tell me about yourself.,"I feel a little behind in everything I am doing for school. I have a hard time reading for long periods of time. My eyes cannot stay focused for very long and words become blurry. It's a constant struggle to understand each sentence. I'm not sure if I have always had this problem. I can read novels fairly easy. I really hate being in class with a lot of people. I don't like to interact with them. They seem to be very clueless over the important parts of the material covered in each session. I'm tired of stupid Internet questions that waste class time. If I had a computer question, I wouldn't stop class to ask it and make myself look stupid like most computer illiterate students. Students in psychology seem to pretend that they are interested in what is taught, but they really are not fully in to the subject. There are so many students who claim they are psychology majors, when in fact, after they take Psy301, they'll change their minds to something over and over until they slide into the working class. I cannot understand many of my peers. Their conversations are pointless and insignificant to their life as a whole. They spend so much time conversing over issues that they usually don't care about. I dislike the general public in the college atmosphere. I thoroughly enjoy the professors, but I can't get any intelligent feedback from my peers. I realize I'm not perfect, by any means, but at least I attempt to improve my intellectual state, somewhat. There are way too many sheltered students. I assume that professors have a hard time, especially with freshman, in trying to relate cultural differences. It must be extremely difficult to maintain the patience required to teach any level of pupils. Students forget that they are the ones paying for the class and the professor. Even in college, they still act as thought they're being forced to attend each session and assigned a certain professor. Most of the time, students fail to research their professors before they sign up for their class. I suppose it takes all kinds to make a world. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, I've never really done a stream of consciousness writing, so hopefully this will be a good experience for me. Right now, I'm thinking about thinking about writing this, its kind of weird to just record everything that crosses your mind because you get weird recursive loops like that. Recursion is the idea that a certain function calls itself, or in layman's terms, an idea that is selfreferencing. I think Stephen was the one who taught me about the idea of a selfreferencing mathematical idea. I just found out today that the classes I plan on taking over the next 3 and a half years will earn me a BS in Computer science, and a BS in Mathematics. At first I just wanted to take a minor in mathematics, but when I was talking to Dr. Turner today he told me that I should check to see how much of the major I would be completing. I hope a double major will help me get into grad school. Right now I really want to go to Carnegie Mellon to do my grad work. They have a really great CS program there. That's assuming of course that I remain a CS major over the next few years. But I don't see my interests changing or anything. I really wonder how well shy people can perform stream of consciousness. We're really not good at expressing our thoughts, especially to other people. Luckily this is typed and not spoken. Well, that's both good and bad, typing runs much more slowly than speaking, but its easier to express my self through text than through words. I misspelled consciousness earlier, and it got underlined red. Its really bugging me, so I think I'll go fix it right now. I know that if I look around my room I'll see something that I want to talk about. Usually that subject will be computer related. Its really sad. (Sad but true dear reader) Why does that make me think of high school. Weird flashback I guess. Never really popular or anything, although the last two years were awesome because I had a great group of friends and together we were really outgoing and audacious. All extremely intelligent. I wish I could meet more intelligent people here. Most of the people I know are either average, or just plain dumb. I did meet some cool people in my CS 307 class. But its too early to tell if they're truly intelligent, or just book smart. That reminds me of the math problem I solved today. Professor Freed always gives out a few homemade math problems on his assignments. He encourages us to attempt them, but he says its ok if we don't actually finish them or anything. Well, so far I'm the only one I know who came up with a solution to his problem. The last part was awesome because it required the use of a computer. I wrote a dinky little program in C to compute all the data, and then I pasted it all into Excel to plot it. Right now I have another program like that running. Its been running for about 140 hours right now. Something like that. Its growing neural networks to survive in a certain situation. These aren't any old artificial neural networks though, they're growth modeled. (my idea). So I hope this new batch of data continues to support my hypothesis. The rhythmic clicking of the keys is kind of distracting. It reminds me of our last psych class, when the girl I sat by thought that if you could type faster than you could write, it was pretty fast. I really disagree. Writing free hand is an extremely slow process, typing goes much faster because the letters are formed instantly when you hit the key. You can't program as fast as you can type so it really doesn't matter for me except in word processing like this, where I need to be able to type as fast as I can or I can't remember what I was thinking. I wonder how long I've been typing. Probably at least 15 minutes. I really haven't been keeping time. Oh well, once this hits a page on size 12 times new roman, that's going to be a lot of text in a fixed point font (like its going to be when I paste it on the web). My DVD player comes in pretty soon. I've been waiting for at least a month because the first one I got didn't work, and then the company ran out of them. I need to buy some DVDs for it. Probably will get the Utena DVDs even though they don't cover the really good episodes at the end. I like anime. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I wonder if I can make it to the SZB building in 20 minutes. Also, do I need to look at the map again? Probably so. I can't remember what room it is in. I think I'll have time for a nap this afternoon. It is definitely much needed; I just hope I can squeeze it in. It's a good thing I only have one class today. I hope the TA doesn't ask as many questions as he did last week. I think all of our brains are a bit numb. Wow. It's only been 2 minutes. This is going to be a long paper. I'm pleased that my parents are being more considerate of the apartment situation. They have to stop procrastinating and realize that this is the best thing to do in this situation. The cost of living in Austin is absurd and so is the demand for living. Gosh. I just moved into SRD and I already have to look for next year. I just hope I don't flunk out or else there goes half of the money! Maybe Michelle's dad talked to her and settled whatever worries she and my dad had. If he was worried about me handling the details with the realtor, he could have talked to him, but he refused. Ugh, like life couldn't be more difficult. Who needs their parents telling them what to do once they have gotten to college. It's my time now and they need to respect that. It's just too hard, I guess. All they ask about is school, grades, sometimes health, and sleep. They have to realize college isn't easy in any aspect, including the financial one. Oh, well, I guess they'll learn. I'm wondering when my dad is going to decide to send my computer here. Oops, that's right. I shouldn't expect it anytime soon since he procrastinates on everything. I feel so bad for having to use Michelle's computer all the time. I wonder what's for lunch today. I bet it's good. It's always good. I love SRD food and the waiters. I'm so happy to be living with Michelle and Stephanie next year. I don't know Julianne too well, though. She seems nice, but I'm just saying that to be nice. I guess she's ok. She isn't the sort of person I would typically hang around with. She's also a neat freak and doesn't like cats. That's two hits against her. The funny thing is, the rest of us are messy, so I don't know who is going to share the room with her. I'm also very excited about the hamster. It will be so much fun to have a little apartment pet. I wonder what we'll name it. I hope my sister learns a lot at the convention this weekend. We all know she needs all the leadership skills she can handle! I wonder if Michelle is coming straight home from school. If so, she should be here pretty soon. I am so excited about Jeff's birthday present. I hope everything works out and Stephanie and I can go to Colleyville and use her RF something equipment. I love being creative and doing fun, meaningful things like that! Oh, my gosh, the 80's prom tonight is going to be so much fun! It'll be awesome to see everyone dressed up. That's a hard theme for guys to follow, though. I wouldn't know what to do if I was one of them. I hope Clay turns out to be cute. I heard he's really sweet. People usually say that if someone isn't that good looking. Oh, well, if I survived a night with Petro, I can definitely survive an 80's prom with Clay. I wonder which ATO knows me. Or, like Jeff said, he could've just been saying that. Either way it was very nice. I wonder what possessed Stephanie to set me up with this guy. I've never been on a blind date before and the suspense is wonderful. I hope all this nasty drainage stuff is just allergies. I think it is. Everyone's allergies seem to be killing them right now. Ha. That was so funny that we saw Brian Grigsby at Jack in the Box last night. It's deja vu. Wow that was neat how those little things popped up over the deja vu words. Wow, it did it again. I hope it is warm enough to go floating down the river this weekend. My mom said a cool front was supposed to move in. I hope not. Can't it wait another day? It'll be fun camping in tents. I've never really roughed it before. I better take my umbrella to school with me. It looks like it is about to rain. Oh, I also need to catch up on emails this afternoon. So much to do, so little time. Wahoo, my time is up. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I just started college last week. It's hard to believe I am finally here. I have been coming to Austin for football games as long as I can remember, but I always go home when they are over. This time I am staying and my family is going home. It's so hard for me to think I will be spending the next four years here. It's so big and full of so many people. The first day of class I didn't know what to think. I was so overwhelmed by it all. I decided to go through rush here at UT, and that was an experience all on it's own. It was a week full of stress, and aching feet. You are surrounded by a bunch of girls that are trying to out do the next and you can't really tell if people are being fake or themselves. I just hoped for the best and tried to have fun. Now that it is all over and I made my bid. I was relieved a little, but not enough. The day after rush ended classes begin. I had no time to relax or get things together. I was stressing out more than I had ever before. I didn't know where my classes were, I missed my friends and family, my roommate and I have been a little off, it seemed like nothing was going right. I really wanted to cry. It's so hard for me to think that I am not happy here because I can vividly recall not too long ago saying that I couldn't wait to get out of high school and get to college. I was so excited about moving to Austin. I didn't think I would miss my family too much because they would be coming down for all the home football games. Boy, was I wrong. I told everyone that I wouldn't think of going home my first weekend of college, but as I sat in my dorm room last Friday thinking about all my friends going home for the holiday I don't think I could have packed up my stuff any quicker. I was so excited about going home. I couldn't wait to get there. Even though I did homework and laid around most of the weekend it was very nice to just relax and not have to worry about anything. There are so many things to do in Austin and even when you say your not going out, someone is always trying to talk you into going somewhere. My past week of college has been fun, but scary. I am not use to being so unorganized. I need a schedule and a daily routine, so I won't feel so strung out and frazzled. So many things have been going through my head, about college and how I feel about it and I can't exactly put it all into words. When people ask me about school I don't know what to tell them. I wish I could say I love it and I am having a blast, but I would be lying. I have had fun, but I am kind of scared and homesick and I feel like I am in a maze and I can't find my way out. I don't think I am making any sense. My feelings are just all jumbled up and I can't seem to sort through them. I need direction. I am hoping every week will get better and I will gradually find my way and start to feel at home here. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am curious on why we need to do this assignment. Is it some sort of test? Or experiment? Well I guess I have to do it any way, so. I'm think that it is late and that damn pretesting takes to much time to just answer the same questions reworded ten times each. I hope my show in San Antonio goes well Wednesday I hope those assheads advertised this time but if not we still get paid. But that's still bad business. I really like the Common Sense album I think I'll burn a copy from sterling. I wonder what my roommates are up to? Probably just sleeping since they all have early class in the morning. My earliest class is Spanish and I dread going to that class. Man it takes up most of my schedule and if I don't do well it will bring my grade down big time, but crap like that happens. At least I can still be a frigging rockstar ha if all else fails. Which isn't looking so bad or hard by today's standards. One hit song will get you paid for life and all I hit songs needs is radio play. NO heart felt lyrics; no emotion, no good beat, and no moveable beat at all even just radio play. If you make it on TRL your set damn we played with Papa Roach and there were probably 700 people at the show the next week they were on TRL and now they could probably sell out a 10,000seat venue easy. I'm not putting them down they are a good band but that just goes to show you how the industry works. One of these days I'll be on top though no doubt. My band plays with a new band or a go to see a new band play ever week and half of them have no stage presence of any show what so ever. And if the crowd is not interested you can sell your total package to them. You can be a band that gets lots of radio play, but if you can get the crowd moving on tour your going to just sparkle and fade. My only fear is I'll be a 30yearold man with kids and still be hunting for this illusive dream and I really don't want to be in that boat. I assume I'll know when the ship has sailed and I'll just except it and move on not swim after it just to sink deeper. Only time will tell though, if nothing else I had my days in the spot light but if my 15 minutes of fame are already up I'm going to be one upset greedy bastard trying to get my hand on just a little more. I guess I've talked about my dream of being a musician enough so I'll move on to my goals at school, which as you can tell are of lesser importance right now. Not to say they are not important it just my dreams cloud my reality and sometimes it hard to see what I need to do rather what I want to do. SO my time is up and I'll see you in class Thursday. "
Tell me about yourself.,"This computer lab, Jester East, is rather warm. It's stuffy in here. That isn't however a bad thing, considering how sick I am. Actually, I'm feeling a whole lot better now, as opposed to this morning. I wonder if I missed out on anything important in Linguistics. I doubt I missed out on much. Oh well. I'm relieved about the calculator issue regarding chemistry. I'm glad I know someone who has a car (means of transportation other than the bus). If I keep shopping I may soon find myself in need of help from my parents, financially. Then again, I am buying necessities: food, soap, water, DayQuill, NightQuill, etc. My nose is cleared up. That's something to be happy about. Ah. I can't help but smile at the fact that he came over and simply spent time with me today. He basically just watched me sleep, sniffle, and cough. He's so sweet. I kind of don't want to go home this weekend because of him. He's gone out of town the last two weekends, and now I'm going out of town. Hmm. I don't leave until Friday night. I guess I should try to get a hold of my parents. They may be interested in my visit. Shoot! Only twelve minutes have passed. I feel like I've been typing for a much longer time period. Uhoh, my nose is causing me to sniffle. Ugh. it's so annoying. Good thing I brought Kleenex with me. My mouth is dry. And my tongue hurts from chewing gum. I'm not use to chewing gum, at least not as much as I have been lately. I'm self conscious about my breath, since I have a sore throat. As a result I'm constantly chewing on cinnamon flavored gum. In a way, this isn't exactly my train of thought, at least not the uninterrupted form. I find myself with the need to explain, or give a bit of background info to the reader, if there even is indeed a reader. Ah well. Just three more minutes to go. I can't wait to get back up to my cold room, pop open a can of ginger ale and chug. I've successfully made mouth feel even more dry. My throat is starting to hurt again, but only when I swallow. One more minute left. Perhaps I'll just type my abc's while I wait for that one minute to pass. Ooh. well aren't I little miss creative. Okay time's officially up!. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am sitting at my roommate's desk typing on a computer which does not belong to me in a room that I am still getting used to. ""Black Magic Woman"" is playing on the radio. I like this song. It reminds me of my mom because she has the record from when she was a Santana fan. The artwork on the cover of the album is really beautiful. There is a red winged creature on the cover and a lot of complex looking designs and a million different colors and stars and growing things. It looks like the night. Today in class I was about to fall asleep. I looked over at Aisha and she was practically dead. I don't think it was because the class wasn't interesting but because it was just the time of day when I feel really tired and I can't really think of anything. When I walk around I feel really relaxed, not at all anxious, and it's kind of pleasant. It reminds me of this boy that works nights, and he would hardly ever sleep and it was kind of nice to be around him because there wasn't a whole lot going on. we would just sit around listening to music or watching things. When he's not tired he talks a lot, and it kind of drives me crazy sometimes. He just talks about cars a lot and how things work and scientific stuff, and he's very passionate about those kind of things. I saw him on Monday and he told me he loved me, and it was so weird. I don't know where that is going. I've known him forever, and I think of him as a person that I can really trust and talk to things about. He reminds me of my father in some ways because my dad always talked a lot sometimes about things that didn't interest me very much but I liked him anyway. I liked how fat he was. It makes me laugh. He was a rather large man and he had really hairy arms like a bear. For some reason I think it's kind of funny to look back on this but maybe it's because I'm kind of tired although I shouldn't be because I've been getting plenty of sleep lately. I wake up in the mornings, and I have this feeling like I just can't wait to get out of the room and walk around, get some fresh air and get out of this little room which I have to share with another person and deal with all her stuff and everything. She's really nice though. I think I might have offended her yesterday because we were talking about Genesis, which we both have to read for our literature class, and I have a lot of questions about what it means and why it's so sacred and important and why God does all the weird stuff that he does in the book. I can't understand why he forbids people to eat the fruit or why he tells people to name their children certain things or why he appears and fights with Jacob. It's pretty messed up if you ask me. How am I supposed to believe in that stuff? It's nuts. I just want to be a good person like my mom. She always helps other people and thinks about others. When my dad was dying, she held everyone together and probably saved me along with everyone else. I don't think I would still be alive without my mom. She's really religious and perfect in most ways. I wish Nathanael were here. He makes me feel better about things most of the time even though he weird me out at times. I wish I could go driving out in the country or even for a walk. I grew up on a farm, and I love open fields and fish and cows and crap like that. It's unfortunate because I can't imagine living anywhere else but in the country even though it is lonely at times. It is so peaceful and beautiful at night. One night Nathanael and I stayed up all night and watched the sun rise. We were sitting on his truck. That was the night before I went to Germany for 3 weeks to visit my best friend who lives there now. I love her so much. She was one of the few people that I ever thought was really like me. She was an incredible artist, and she inspired me to take up drawing and painting. My dad was an artist too. I have one drawing of his on my room at home. He liked to do cartoons and make corny jokes. He was so wonderful with people, and everyone loved him. Sometimes I imagine what it would be like if he just walked into the room right now and how I would feel about seeing him after all this time. For I second I feel so excited, but then I realize that it could never happen. It is the most horrible feeling to know that you will never again see someone that you love so much, especially someone that you admired and tried to make yourself like them. "
Tell me about yourself.,"As I sit here, I wonder what I got myself into. I came from a school of 300 people. I graduated with a senior class of 76. The University is such a huge place, I wonder if I'm going to fit in, or should I say, make my self conscious of my surroundings. It's not that I don't like my classes that I have now, or that they are already becoming a problem, but I wonder what the future holds. My birthday is today, and I am finally 18. It seems like it took forever for me to get to this point. But now that I finally made it, it's no different. My mom called this morning to wish me a Happy Birthday, and she sounded kind of sad. Her little baby girl is now 18. She asked my why it went by so quickly, but looking back, it took forever. My grandparents also called this morning. They live across the street from my old house, and I was continuously over there visiting them. She told me that she still thinks that I'm going to come through that door and ask her what's for dinner. She says it's like I'm gone for the weekend, but I'll return soon. And my grandpa, well, he's my favorite. Every time I look at him, I see all of his hard work and strength that he has put into his life. Raising 8 kids is no easy job. The day after their 50th wedding anniversary, everybody attended mass, almost all 27 grandchildren, 16 sons and daughters, and a couple of greatgrandchildren. I was going to read for the mass. I went up to the podium and I looked out there at all of my family and then looked at my grandpa. I was so proud to be a part of that. I was thankful that God allowed me to be there and have that feeling. And now when I talk to him on the phone, I get that feeling all over again. I miss him dearly. Sometimes I think more than I miss my mom or my brother. Now, my step dad, I don't miss him at all. Sometimes I look back, and I don't know how I put up with him so long. He is so evil and cruel, at least he was or is to me. He married my mom when I was 6 years old. I didn't know him that well; my mom always made me go outside and play when he came over. He was just a total control freak. Nobody in my mom's family likes him because of all the pain he's caused me over the years. From getting in my face and just yelling at me for no apparent reason, to slapping me across the face because my mom and I had gotten into a name calling fight. He's a dick, that's all there is to it. I never brought friends over to spend the night; I never wanted any guys to come over to see me. My escape place was at my grandparent's house. I would tell my dad about all the shit he was putting me through, but there was nothing he could do about it. All he would tell me was that I could come up there and live with him any time I wanted to. On weekends I was hardly home, I was usually spending the night at Holly's house, she is my best friend. Now that I'm at college, I don't have to put up with him anymore. I don't plan on coming home anytime soon. My mom and brother can come up here if they want to see me. Talking about what comes to mind is difficult. I feel that I have burdened you with all of my family problems. Don't feel sorry for me, I don't. Life is just a difficult thing to deal with sometimes. "
Tell me about yourself.,"The cell phone just rang. It was my roommate's phone so I didn't pick it up. I had a great weekend. All I can think about is my exboyfriend. How stupid am I to be writing about something like my exboyfriend. He makes me feel so weak. He is my Achilles heal. He makes me feel like no other can. He manipulates me like no other. In a good way. He is all I can think about sometimes. I'm listening to Dave Matthews. I am wondering by the time I am done with this assignment whether or not I will selfdiagnose myself with ADD because I know I will jump from one thought to another. I will stop at 3:33PM. Right now it is 3:17. I ate breadsticks today with my good friend Ngozi. We have been friends for 7 years. Tomorrow I get to see Jets to Brazil at Emo's. I am extremely excited. Sometimes I draw blanks on what to type. Interesting. The blinking of the computer is bugging me. I am listening to Dave Matthews right now. He can be a little too jazzy for me. I am not a big fan of the saxophone. I don't like Kenny G. Even though he doesn't play the sax. I just called my best friend at OSU. She hates it there. The thing is, writing for a good twenty minutes is hard. I got all my thoughts out just a minute ago because I wrote in my journal. I have my own website where I have journal entries and pictures and various other interesting things. After this I will do the pretesting. I hear it is pretty long. That's never fun. I hate the food at Andrews. It tastes like a bunch of nothing. I also feel like keeling over after I eat the food, too. I am not using Microsoft Word for this. This is straight typing into the submit form. You think in a room of 540 kids there would be some boy to catch my eye. guess what? Not one. I still love my exboyfriend. Why do I jump back to him? I went to a frat party last Friday. It was fun, but I don't think I could date a frat guy. They are not really my type. I wish I could get over my exboyfriend. But would that be a good thing or bad? Who says I need to get over him? He was my first, possibly my last. I think he has very strong feelings about me too. I wonder though. Boys can be very ambiguous at times. Why can't we all be blunt? My Kirby Lane experience has been forever tainted. My food was cold and I saw a girl toss her cookies in the parking lot. People can be so irresponsible sometimes. They need to know their limit, or just take care of their business in the privacy of their own place not in front of Kirby Lane. My hands are crampy from all this typing. This is an interesting project. Anyway, I am going home this weekend. Back to Grand Prairie. I miss my niece. Her name is Ashley Rene Johnson. She is adorable. She just turned two and I wonder if she remembers me. I hope she is talking more. She is beginning to worry me. she barely talks. A homeless man hit on me today! In front of Bevo's! I was startled, but was I guess flattered. He had sunglasses on, so maybe he saw a distorted version of me. He called me beautiful. Hardly. It is getting cold. I am anxious to reread this writing assignment. It is 3:33. Thank you. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Ever since this assignment was introduced in class, I've been trying to think about what to write (which totally defeats the purpose of the assignment). It's just that when I sit down at the computer to type something, I usually have a plan or goal in mind, whether it is to write a report about something or type an email to a friend. Never have I just had to sit at a computer and type whatever comes to my mind. I guess that makes me a bit boring in a way because I find it so hard to express myself at times. The other day when you were talking about obsessivecompulsive people, my roommate turned to me and said, ""That's you!"" I guess I had never really thought about that label applying to me. But once you started listing examples, I had an epiphany. I guess I am obsessivecompulsive in some ways. I like everything neat, clean, and orderly. I can't stand having a dirty living space. I mean, how can you sleep and use the bathroom in a dirty environment? For me, it's just not possible. Plus, I think it's important to be neat and clean because that's the first thing people see when they walk into your room, and how you maintain your room really tells a lot about your personality. I like to make good first impressions and the way I maintain my room is a way of achieving that. I think I get a lot of this from my mother because she's really picky about the way she likes to do things. I remember one time I started doing the dinner dishes for her while she was outside in the backyard and when she came in, she pretty much kicked me out of the kitchen because I wasn't washing the dishes ""the right way. "" Of course I can't really complain because I do a lot of that too. I understand that everyone has their own way of doing things, but I just like to do things my way because I see the logic in it. A lot of my friends think I'm a freak for being so neat, clean, and organized, but if I wasn't, I can't even imagine what my life would be like. Being clean and organized is what brings stability into my life. It is something that will never change. I guess I shouldn't say that because every time I say I will never do something, I end up doing it later on. For example, when I was younger, I told my older sister I would never wear lipstick or any other makeup and now if you look in my purse, you will see powder, two shades of lipstick, and lipliner. So I guess that's why I should never say never. I have so much to do today. I probably should have done it yesterday instead of sleeping and watching television all day. Of course I had fun doing crossword puzzles and playing Jeopardy online with my boyfriend. I've always loved playing intellectual games. It makes me feel great when I can answer a question or figure out a word on a puzzle because people are really smarter than they think. Sometimes you think you don't remember anything from a class you took sophomore or junior year in high school, but then it pops up in a Jeopardy question and you know the answer to it. It amazes me the things I remember from some of my classes in high school. And sometimes, that information came from classes that I thought were totally useless at that time. Now, I realize that there's no such thing as useless information (except for maybe Calculus when you're studying to be a Communications major). "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now I am thinking about this writing assignment. I am assessing the amount of physical and metal effort I will have to put into it. It appears to be low effort on both fronts. I have two conflicting thoughts now. On one side the easies gives me more time to relax. It is night now and I am not really in the relaxing mood. I want to go out and do something but somehow I am more dependent on other people to be able to do something than I was living with my parents. My expectations of independence have not been meet yet. I am now thinking that other people would get angered or distraught about this fact but my reaction is unlike that. I tend to just formulate new expectations and throw the other ones out. Speaking of throwing things out, the trash is damn full. This assignment is already starting to bore me and I just started it. I wish I didn't have separate classes instead just one big project that consisted of elements taught in my classes that I could dedicate my time to. I find these big projects to be more worthwhile and challenging. When things aren't challenging, I must event a challenging task or at least a large one. Physical fitness a first was one of these challenges but it has changed. Now I workout for relaxation and for selfimage. Naturally I am shy. This bothers me because being shy involves things that don't make sense to me. I really have nothing to lose by going out on a limb to talk to someone or present an idea but if I don't remind myself of these things talking to someone isn't a natural reaction. I am pronature in many respects. I am against the taking of medicine to the point won't take aspirin. I am even against vitamins because nothing can replace natural foods. I am surprised I haven't mentioned any of my feelings but the thing I am more surprised at is that I have had none. And now that I think about it I haven't had any for a long time. I used to get yelled at and grounded a lot as a kid and at some point it didn't matter any more. I got tired of being mad at my parents or vengeful toward them or feeling depressed. I was like 6 when this happened and though my parents have changed I haven't. I don't let anything affect me anymore. I have been away from my mom, dad, brother, sister, and dog and I don't really miss them. Talking about the past too long also bores me. I like looking towards the future because it gives me a slight sense of excitement. It gives me excitement because I look forward to bigger and better things. Right now I can't define things. Things used to be money, wife, good friends, and children. I dream more often now and my dreams have made things unclear. Bigger and better things like heaven sometimes come to mind. I have had a spiritual awakening. I not religious, in the sense I don't go to church. But I try to communicate with God in more subtle ways. I have a firm belief in that by believing that something good will happen, something good will happen. I never have doubt in this because you must wholeheartedly believe. The first night I was here I left my cellphone at a restaurant and 2 hours later when I came back it had been found and returned to me. I left a book for one of my classes in the seat beside me. When I came back for it, it was gone. I emailed my teacher and he said a student had given it to him and I was lucky because he could of sold it to the coop for fifty dollars. Luck is one of those things I don't have. I would never rely on chance more than I had too. It was not luck my book was returned. I am glad I am at UT or for that case away from home. My Mom is very pessimistic and impatient. These thing irritate me to the point where I like avoiding her. A categorize her in the group of who claim to be religious or believe in God but they don't truly. They are not honest with themselves so it is impossible for them to always be honest to me. I have a friend who is always lying. I think he does it to make people envy him. But I don't think he realizes I don't envy people I just respect them and try to get to their level not to be them. My mind is at a blank now. I am only thinking about the humming of the computer. Time is up. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Okay for 20 minutes hopefully it will go by relatively fast. I have so much to do today studying, and going to workout will probably consume the rest of my day. But I am finally settling into a routine, it's taken a couple of weeks but I am getting the hang of college life. Most of my friends are going home for the weekend but it's too soon for me. I want to stay, besides I went to Dallas last weekend for Labor Day for my sister's birthday. I got to see my best friend Zach who is now in Colorado trying to wrestle. But I am not anxious to go home just yet, especially since I will there the first weekend of October for TXOU and the Santana concert. Then later that month my mom and my sisters will be coming to see me here at school. My oldest sister Maggie is bringing her new fiance. I haven't met him yet, but he must be a good guy if she has chosen to marry him she of all people would not stand to be burnt twice. They both have to go get annulments from their previous marriages so they can be wed in a Catholic church. Catholicism is kind of funny that way I come from a very strong Catholic family and my father would rather have preferred me to attend the University of Dallas which is Catholic and not Liberal UT. However, my parents strategically placed my in Dobie, next to the university Catholic center. Smart people. Little do they know the last time I went to church was when I was in Dallas. My dad also really pushes me to become a doctor which is what I have wanted to do for the majority of my life. But last spring, architecture was really introduced to me and now I am in Dean Speck's architecture class which is fascinating I love it. Who knows when I'll figure out what I want to do, I do have the feeling that no matter what I decide to do that I'll probably endure some sort of midlife crisis and completely change my career. But that's okay with me, there are a lot of people who do that. My sister Jennifer, for example, is 29 and is about to take her LSAT and apply to law school. She is even applying to UT Law that would be cool if she was down here too. I like being on my own though and not really having the responsibility of worrying about her. It's not that she places that responsibility on me but I am the closest to her out of my family so I am usually the one in the middle trying the best way to help her alcoholism and depression. Yeah, she's applying to law school. At least she has some sort of direction. It's hard for her to hear the truth. But I slammed it down her throat this summer and I think it hit her. I wonder when Kim is getting home. I think she said 5:00. I like having the whole suite to myself though I can actually get some stuff done. We have to go later to the house and put in some study hours with Reese. Reese is probably lonely without Jessica around to bug her. I hope I get her as my Diamond Sister, that would be really cool. Kim is going home this weekend along with the rest of the world to see Dave Matthews Band one of my favorites. I have seen them in concert before and tickets are expensive so I don't think I am going to go. Unless my boyfriend can find some relatively good priced lawn tickets not likely. I'd like to see everyone then again it's too soon to come home. I miss my dog. It took me 17 years to get a dog and I finally get the most perfectly adorable black lab and I leave for school. I'll probably breed labs when I'm older I love Labs and I don't see why I'd ever have any other kind of dog. My suitemates are really organized I am typing on Amy's computer and I'm noticing how clean her desk isooh, I'm done! "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, this is interesting, writing for 20 minutes straight, I don't know if I've ever written for that long continuously before, this should be a welcome challenge. My roommate is bustling around the room, packing for retreat, and he forgot to do this assignment, he's running around the room packing and trying to do this assignment, haha, it's kind of funny. sucks for him that he forgot about this, he's going on a campus crusade trip this weekend, so I have the entire room to myself, wonder what things I can do with that luxury, hmmmm, time to ponder what interesting things can happen this weekend. Cosby show is on, I'm waiting to watch my favorite cartoon at 4 o'clock, dragon ball z. Japanese animation at it's best. I think I just have a thing for fighting and energy balls flying through the air and planets being blown up. I guess I'm just like a stereotypical guy. I'M football starts this weekend. I'm pretty excited. I signed up through CBS. known as chinese bible study. should be fun since I get to meet some new people considering I came from a pretty strong contingent of people I already knew from the Dallas area, mainly centered around plano. Austin is a really cool place. more things to do then in plano. but. not having a car kind of sucks. can't just go wherever. unless I feel like walking. which doesn't happen very often. only thing that is troubling is the weather. so freaking hot and humid and. just. nasty. can't wait until fall and winter when it's nice and cool outside with some rain and some mist. that'd be nice. none of this 110 degree weather. for a few months at least. Just got done with classes today. chemistry. right now it's pretty much a review of chemistry I I took in high school. so. not too troublesome yet. but the teacher is pretty good. she's really into the chemistry and lectures well even though most of the people already know how to do everything from high school. but it's nice to see the drive she has to teach and get the information through to us. my roommate just stocked up on food. he made a pilgrimage to the HEB because he's lucky and didn't have a class today. no class at all. what a punk. well. I shouldn't complain. I have one class on Tuesday and Thursday. that's pretty nice. it's just calculus discussion too. so. I can get away with like. dozing off in that class. I'm going to lake travis this weekend with some friends. that should be pretty fun. get away from the city for a bit. and. get nice a dark. hope I don't get burned. and. don't want to turn the color of burnt toast either. I will no longer look chine se. hmmm. should I get a hair cut this weekend? I'm thinking about changing my hair. want to cut it shorter. because. it's nice and hot around here in Austin. shorter hair would be nice. considering I do walk everywhere for now. hmmm. provocative. maybe I'll ask some people what they think. then I can trek down to the drag and find a place to get my hair chopped. or. ear's lowered. whatever is the lingo nowadays. I have a lot of reading to do this weekend. what a bummer. I have to read the 4 books out of the odyssey for Greek. and I have a quiz on Monday. I have to read chemistry and start the hw. I have some calc hw I should do. and. need to read for psych. what a weekend. tons and tons of reading. but. football on Sunday. get to watch some NFL and get to see how well my fantasy players do. hopefully I'll win in fantasy football this week. lost last week. kind of made me mad. my team didn't produce. but it happens. hmmm. hope I get to play basketball this weekend too. haven't played in a few days. and didn't play as much as usual this week. wonder if my skills have deteriorated. guess it'd be a good time to find out. just play some pick up game against some friends. hopefully I'll get to dominate. but. in all likeliness. I'll be toasted. nicely toasted. oh well. it happens. I'm really tired right now. I should have slept earlier. I don't know though. I slept around 12:30. I should be okay. that's 8 hours. maybe it was because my roommate was snoring so I couldn't get any sleep. kept waking up in the middle of the night to that hideous sound. that'll keep you awake. but once I hit him. he shut up. should keep that in mind more often. hehehe. hmmm. I'm trying to submit this. because I've written for more then 20 minutes. but I can't. hopefully I'll be able to turn this in on time. I only have an hour and a half to turn this in. well. hopefully all will work out for the good. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now I have a flood of emotions coming down on me. Maybe I'm just to sensitive. I feel that I close myself up when I'm around my friends. Why I do, I do not know. There are some friends of mine that I can just relax and worry about what they think of me. My other friends, I just do not know. It's not just that, but when I am around a group of certain people, I can not open myself to them. The reason why, is that in the past, when I have opened myself to people, they turn on me or talk bad about me. I am very sensitive to things of that matter. I do not want people to think of me as being snobbish or stuck up when I do not talk to them. I act kind of quiet around boys because in the past, boys have now always been nice to me. Things have changed since junior high and high school, but still I have to watch my back. Who knows what they say or think about me. I need to stop being so selfconscious about myself and be more confident about myself. I think I am a nice person and I am openminded about certain things. I feel that if someone wants to talk to me, then I will be there to listen. Whatever they tell me will be held in confidence and not told to anyone if they ask me not too. I still would not tell anyone what they told me even if they did not say so. The reason why is that I do not think it is anybody's business. Well, I do feel that there are good qualities about me and some bad ones too. We are not perfect. Humans have their little flaws here and there. I will admit to my flaws. There are some that I am embarrassed to admit which means I need to work on them. Speaking about working, I need to work out. I worked out only once this week, and I need to work out more. Over the summer, I worked out almost everyday. Well not exactly, but each day was a potential day to work out. It was either school, work, or other emergencies that came up that prevented me from keeping up with my workout schedule. Even so, I still got my three to six times a week that I wanted to get. My clothes are fitting better now, which proves that working out this summer did contribute to my slimming down. Still, I have some more work to go. It's not just having a great figure, it is about being in good health, which we all need to be. I have noticed that after working out, my asthmas is not as bad, and I have not been as sick as I was in the past. Exercise and a good diet works. It can work miracles, and myself and thousands of people out there are living proofs. I can not afford to get sick right now, especially since school has started. If I was to become sick right now, I would be behind in all of my classes and that would not be fun. That would be bad. Let's hope that I do not go down that road. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I came back to my home town for Labor Day. I didn't really want to, but my friend talked me into coming with her. I've only been gone a week and I'm already back. Why? I'm not home sick. I guess I just didn't want to stay in Austin when everyone I knew was leaving. I hope Ajay made it to the airport. I'm really worried about him right now. I pray for his mom to get better but I just don't know. I want to promise him everything is going to be alright but I just can't. I wish he would stop drinking to make the pain go away but I guess if it makes him feel better right now. Who am I to tell him what to do anyway? I wonder what time Michael's game is tomorrow. My mom told me but I forgot. Maybe I should have gone to Dallas this weekend. I don't know? I think anything's better that being in Odessa. Football is such a big thing here. Of course the first thing we do is go to Jeesong's football game as soon as we got here. I'm glad Ajay doesn't do anything as dangerous as that I already worry about him enough. I really think we are maturing in our relationship, learning to work through problems that most couples don't ever have in their entire lives. I don't know what he's going to do if he loses her too. I know she wants to be with his dad but isn't it selfish to leave your children. Catherine just came in here to ask me what time I was going to get up. I said 10 but that wasn't early enough so we decided on 9:30. I am very happy with my schedule because I don't have a class before 9:30 and I like all of them. One thing about school I hate is that I'm always so tired. Why can't I check my stupid email from my house? You would think a major computer system at a major university would have some way you could check it without having to download this and that. You should be able to enter your IF or UTEID and open a link site, but no. Nothing is that easy. I hate computers and if I never had to use one I wouldn't mind a bit, but if I didn't know how I couldn't pass any of my classes. That is another thing. Why is everything I need for a class on the internet? I feel sorry for people who have no clue how to use it. I thought Kris was never going to hook up her computer but she finally discovered she had no choice. Computers are our lives these days. What would the human race do without them? It's scary you know, our whole life is on this thing and if they know what their doing, anyone could find some thing you don't want them to have. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I hope that I am doing this assignment correctly. I don't want to do badly in this class or in anything this semester. I wonder what my friends are doing right now. I don't want to wake up early tomorrow. Maybe I won't be tired. I probably will. I wish Seth would hurry up and call me. I get tired of waiting. I need to do homework for math, but I don't really know how. I also don't want to go to Spanish tomorrow. I want my mom to buy me a new cell phone. I'm very glad this week is almost over. I'm excited about this weekend. I'll be very busy, but I'll have a lot of fun. I really hope that the guy I called today about buying his puppy doesn't sell it before I can have enough money to buy it. I'm so full. I shouldn't have eaten so much dinner. I hope my friend Heather isn't mad at me for not calling her back for two weeks. I really don't want to go to school anymore. I wish I was married to a professional athlete or something. I'm very tired today even though I got plenty of sleep last night. My mom is so nice, but she gets so annoying sometimes. I feel really bad for being rude to her sometimes, but she treats me like I am in junior high sometimes. Probably because I'm the baby and she misses all her kids. I wish she would get a job or something so that she'd have something to do since my dad's never there for her. Maybe Seth is home and he's calling me but he can't get hold of me because I am on the computer. Twenty minutes is a lot longer than you'd think. I don't think I have ever typed for twenty minutes straight before. The computer even thinks so. Now I'm going to have to resign online for the tenth time. Very annoying. I really just want to crawl into my bed right now. I would much rather sleep than do my homework but I guess I had better do my homework so I don't ruin my GPA. Even though I'm sure it won't be as high this semester as last year. Oh well, it's not really my fault. I really don't think all that much in my head I don't believe because I am running out of things to type. I wish that I was in the Caymans with all of my friends right now. That would be so much fun. Maybe over Christmas or something. I think that not everyone could afford it though. I am so glad that I am still on my parents' payroll. I would be nowhere without it. I can't believe some people have to pay for their tuition and things like that. I couldn't imagine, but then again most of them are married or have babies or both. I definitely could not imagine that either. I wish I could stay this age or younger forever. Preferably a freshman in college. I really didn't realize how much fun I was having until I had to grow up a year. I hope that I am doing this assignment correctly. I don't want to do badly in this class or in anything this semester. I wonder what my friends are doing right now. I don't want to wake up early tomorrow. Maybe I won't be tired. I probably will. I wish Seth would hurry up and call me. I get tired of waiting.

I wish she would get a job or something so that she'd have something to do since my dad's never there for her. Maybe Seth is home and he's calling me but he can't get hold of me because I am on the computer. Twenty minutes is a lot longer than you'd think. I don't think I have ever typed for twenty minutes straight before. The computer even thinks so. Now I'm going to have to resign online for the tenth time. Very annoying. I really just want to crawl into my bed right now. I would much rather sleep than do my homework but I guess I had better do my homework so I don't ruin my GPA. Even though I'm sure it won't be as high this semester as last year. Oh well, it's not really my fault. I really don't think all that much in my head I don't believe because I am running out of things to type. I wish that I was in the Caymans with all of my friends right now. That would be so much fun. Maybe over Christmas or something. I think that not everyone could afford it though. I am so glad that I am still on my parents' payroll. I would be nowhere without it. I can't believe some people have to pay for their tuition and things like that. I couldn't imagine, but then again most of them are married or have babies or both. I definitely could not imagine that either. I wish I could stay this age or younger forever. Preferably a freshman in college. I really didn't realize how much fun I was having until I had to grow up a year. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I have so much reading to do. It seems in all of my classes the professors are overwhelming us with material. But I guess that is to be expected in college, or at least that's what they told us. But I will persevere. I did have above a 100 GPA in high school. So this shouldn't be too hard. But I have to maintain a 4. 0 to please myself. That's attainable too, though. I know myself good enough to know that I will put everything else aside if my grades start to slip. Like last night, I really didn't want to stay in, but I had to catch up on a lot of things. Yep, I'll definitely maintain. No problem. Bye, bye, bye. Man, I hate that song. I wish stupid songs wouldn't get stuck in my head. I've always wondered about the stars. I think it would be the ultimate thing to impress a girl if you took her on a picnic and could lay and look at the stars and point out all the constellations. Hey, then maybe I should take Astrology for my science. After all, I do need two semesters of a science to graduate Business Honors. But I heard that that class was semidifficult, and I need an easy A in my science class. It can't be that bad though. I mean, after all, how hard can looking at the stars be. But in all sciences, they find ways to talk about stuff that I wouldn't have ever imagined could be taught about. Dang, I hate science. All sciences. Well, I guess social sciences aren't that bad. But those aren't really sciences. Just the basic ones bio, chem. , physics, yeah, can't stand those. All right, only ten minutes left. I would have guessed that in ten minutes I would have thought about more stuff. Guess not. What is time? I mean, it is time to us, but why should the universe revolve around humans. I'm sure there are other beings somewhere out there, but we don't have proof. There were those circles in the wheat fields somewhere, but that's not proof. Just some stupid Iowan rednecks trying to get publicity. Just like that kid who is now charging Bobby Knight with abuse. That's so stupid. Just a publicity stunt. It is so apparent to everyone that he didn't do anything wrong. He may have been a little stern in the manner he addressed the kid, but that is nothing that should be brought to the forefront like this. Stupid. I can't wait until college basketball starts, that is the best time of year. Although I go to UT now, I will always be a Duke basketball fan. I have been since I can remember. That's not bad is it? Nah. I enjoy college football, but it just isn't the same to me. I guess it's because college basketball has more action, and because the kids actually care. Not like the NBA. All of them are lazy and just worried about the money, whereas the NCAA the kids play for the name on the front of the jersey, not the back. But I guess there are some players who don't do that. Oh well, I don't care. Bye, bye, bye. Dang, stop it. I need to hook up with a girl tonight. I've been here too long not to have yet. It really gets me how people can have random sex. I'm quite proud to be a virgin, and I will be until I get married. And I know that God will keep me strong. Like my roommate. I just don't understand. Bye, bye, bye. All right. This thing is finally over. One less thing I have to worry about. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I hate you. I hate how you have the power to hurt me. I hate how I called you wanting to merely tell you about ""our"" song being on tv and I got shot down. I hate how you called me some other girl's name thinking it was her that called. I hate how you can call some other girl and start to like her so soon after we broke up. You said that you had feelings for me merely 4 days ago and how can you forget about me so quickly? Was I just not that special to you that you could forget about me so soon? I hate you for not wanting to have a long distance relationship with me even though you're only like 2 hours away. I hate you for making me hurt so badly inside. I hate you for making me feel that horrible feeling you get in your chest when someone just breaks up with you. I hate you for having the power to invoke such emotion within me. I thought that you were different. I thought that you of all people wouldn't hurt me. You always told me to give you the benefit of the doubt and I finally learned to do that. You always said how you never wanted to hurt me and you never did until last night. Nothing you ever did was as painful as that. I just felt like someone had stabbed me and run over me a few times. I care so much about you still and I just don't understand you. You told me that you didn't want to have a girlfriend this first year at school, but then why in the hell are you calling a girl to get something started with her? How could you lie to me when I asked you who she was? You of all people never lied to me and never hurt me, but last night you ruined everything that I had made you out to be. I had you on a pedestal from all the other guys that I've been with and you proved me wrong. I wish you could feel all the hurt that I feel right now. I wish you could hurt so much that you don't know what to do about it. I wish you could take this hurt away from me because I don't deserve to feel this way. All I ever did was care about you and be good to you. I'm not sorry I still have feelings for you because you were just that special to me that it will take me awhile to get over you. I could never call some other guy and start talking to him so soon. It's so early and not fair to the other person. It took you forever to ask me out because you wanted to make sure you were over Michelle but what about Tara? How can you talk to her so soon if I know you still have feelings for me? Am I just that easy to get over? I thought I was so much more than that. I'm not stupid, Travis. I know you all too well. I know when you lie to me, but I guess I didn't know you too well because I never thought you could hurt me. I never thought you could be with another girl so soon after me. You told me not to start something with another guy to fill that void of you. Is that what you're doing because that's not fair. I just can't believe you. I wish there was something you could do to make me feel better, but I don't think there is. I don't even know how we can be friends anymore. I can't trust you even as a friend. I now know that you can lie to me. I wish it wasn't like this between you and me. I wish we could be together because things were so great with you that I didn't want to let it go. You were the best boyfriend I ever had but I don't know about that anymore. You ruined that whole perfect picture for me. I hate you for making me feel such sadness. How can you do that? "
Tell me about yourself.,"Today was a pretty good day. I had only one class and then I had the chance to take a nap. I was so tired. And I am not sure why. I mean I know why, I am up until late on the phone every night with Danny but I should be getting used to that right? I think that after over a year of talking on the phone that late I would be used to it. I miss him so much. I wish he were here with me. It seems like everything that I do or see or hear reminds me of him. Sometimes I have a hard time concentrating in class because I am thinking about him. That is not a good thing; I mean I need to concentrate on my work and my studies. Sometimes I feel guilty because I feel like I miss him more than I miss my family. Is that bad? I mean I feel like it shouldn't be that way. But I love him so much. I constantly wonder if we will end up being together forever. I really think this could be the one. I am really nervous though about even telling my parents about how serious we are. I mean they must suspect something but I know they would never guess exactly how serious we are. I always wished I could tell my parents more than what I do but I never have felt like we have any kind of connection in that respect. It seems like all my good friends have that and I am defiantly jealous about that. I mean Laura, my roommate, has that with her mom. She can tell her mom anything. Why is it that I never felt like I could talk to my mom? I will never do that with my kids, I mean when I have kids I am going to keep that line of communication open. I mean I don't think they want me to be their best friend or anything and that doesn't faze me but I would like to be able to talk to them about the daily gossip at school or the party they went to last weekend or their boy/girl problems. I think that if Danny and I do stay together, he would make a great father. I mean he has the same opinions as me about raising kids and all that. I mean that is a lot of the reason we are so good together. We think alike and we know what the other one is thinking. Something I just thought about is our friends. I like his friends, and they like me. But it seems that some of my good friends just don't think highly of Danny. I mean it is upsetting. Liv makes me mad because she thinks she knows what is going on and she thinks that I could do better, I constantly tell her that she couldn't know. She doesn't know Danny like I do and she doesn't know the type of relationship that Danny and I have. Jill usually is pretty positive about things with Danny and I and so is Laura. Matt it seems never is. But Matt is a whole other story. I don't talk to Matt all the time anymore being that he still is back in San Antonio. One thing I can't stand about Matt is his constant mood changes. It is just so hard for me to deal with that sometimes. And it seems like no matter what happens he always knows what is going on between Danny and me and if he doesn't he asks me and expects that I am just going to tell him. What does he think I am stupid? He can't keep a secret and that bugs me. I mean if I tell a good friend of mine something that I think is personal, I would expect them not to say anything. The problem is that I don't always tell them not to say anything but I would hope being that they are my best friend they would be able to figure that out on their own. I think that is not too much to ask. Just the other day Matt asked what Danny and I did the other night. That is none of his business and I tell him that and he still pries. What is his problem? Sometimes I wonder how Matt and I have stayed friends for so long, and good friends at that. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Trying to decide what to eat for dinner is complicated, especially when people don't answer the question. When you ask someone ""What do you want to eat?"" most likely they will say, ""I don't know what do you want?"" Well, if I did know what I wanted to eat, I wouldn't have asked you. It is a simple question with a simple answer. Right now I just asked my boyfriend what he wanted for dinner and his response was, ""I don't know whatever you want"". Well, that's why I asked you, I don't know what I want to eat, that's why I asked you. I guess that I wanted him to make the decision for me. I honestly don't know what I want to eat. It's a simple question and it's up to my stomach and brain to make that decision, but I'm asking someone to make this important decision for me. Does this mean that I'm lazy because I want someone else to make a decision that I can only make for myself. Maybe I'm not lazy; maybe it's just I want someone to help me make that decision. That seems logical, a person can't be lazy simply because he or she doesn't want to make a decision for themselves. "
Tell me about yourself.,"After my first week at the University of Texas, my mind is filled with a mixture of thoughts and emotions. On one hand, I am excited about starting at a new school and the opportunities that await me. However, I also worry whether I'll be able to balance the social aspect of my life with the challenges of school. First and foremost in my mind presently is pledgeship, which is drawing constantly nearer. What am I going to have to do? How am I going to be able to stay at the house all night and do others' chores and keep a good GPA? It will surely be difficult, but I am fairly confident I can do it. I have always been successful at overcoming challenges in my life. The hardships of pledgeship combined with the rigors of being in the business honors program should make for a busy semester, to say the least. I feel a great amount of pressure to perform. I have to make at least a 3. 5 to stay in the BHP, and 3. 25 to keep my scholarship money. This is the root of the nervous feelings within me. There is also a great deal to be excited about this semester also. I am excited about the experiences I will have, the people I will meet, and the friends I will make. This semester will be unlike any other I've had in my life. Thinking of the times I've had in the past 9 days since I arrived here makes me certain I chose a great school to attend. The BHP will offer me incredible future opportunities, and the friendships I forge with my pledge brothers will last a lifetime. I still can't believe that I'm already in college and moved away from home. I will face a great number of challenges this semester, but I am excited about them and overcoming these challenges will make this semester all the more rewarding. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Ok, so I guess I am just going to start writing about anything. Today has been a busy day, I got a lot of things done that I needed to so that is kind of a relief. I am really stressed out right now so I am trying to organize what I need to get done in my head. I finally get to move into my new home tomorrow after class. I have been homeless for the past month. The past few weeks I've been staying with friends but it really sucks not having a place of your own. I feel really disorganized right now and I hate to start the school year out that way. The next few days are going to be busy moving in. I got UT vs. OU tickets today. That's one thing I don't have to worry about anymore. But now I need to get that trip organized. Casey, Karoly, Austin, and C. J. have all committed. I need at least one more person to commit so the hotel room won't be too expensive. That shouldn't be hard though so I am not going to think about that now. I really want to go running right now but it's the middle of the day and really hot. I think I might go anyways. Then I'll come back and shower, pick up Casey from class at 5:40, and start getting ready to go out. The band we're going to see starts at 8. That is going to start the night out early. But, I guess that is a good thing because then it will end early, which means more sleep before class in the morning. I am listening to some music right now that makes me want to dance! What sucks is that I can't dance though. I wonder why God gives some people rhythm and some not. I hate not having rhythm because I love music. People say that everyone can dance, just do it, but I am proof that that is not true. Oh well. I need to get over that. My neck hurts, I guess I slept on it wrong. I hate it when I have a crick in my neck. I really feel like running today. I wonder why. Running dancing where is all this energy coming from? I haven't gotten much sleep in the past couple days. I think my body does better when I don't get as much sleep. When I sleep late I feel depressed that I wasted part of the day and I am still tired. Today I woke up early and I feel productive. Let's see what all I did. I went early and tried to draw football tickets. They told me to come back later so I went back to my friend's place and called my mom. I made a dentist appointment which is long overdue, drove to my storage place and paid a bill, found out I could move in tomorrow at 3:00, bought a few CDs I've been wanting, went out to eat for lunch, and then went and got the football tickets. Now I am doing some homework. Next I am going to run, hopefully not die of a heat stroke, then tonight I have a ticket to see a band play I have been wanting to see. That will be fun. I thought about taking a nap but it doesn't look like that is going to happen. I guess I'll just have a couple cups of coffee before I start drinking some beers. Well, it looks like my time is up. This assignment reminds me of my emails to my friends. I just sit down and type whatever comes out and they end up being really long, boring, and pointless. Kind of nice I get to do it for a grade and not annoy my friends. Peace out. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, this is my second writing assignment to try to submit. I tried Monday and Wednesday, Monday it wouldn't even let me on the site, and Wednesday it teased meit let me type the entire stream, and then erased it when I tried to submit it. So, hopefully this one works, because I can't find Microsoft Word on this PC. I wish I could go to sleep because I am so tired. Last night I went to 6th Street and I had blisters on my feet. This morning, I had to get up and go to work. AND MY FEET HURT. I am never going to 6th again, it is hell! I want to go to sleep, but I am here, writing this. At 2:55 I have to go get my Hep shot, yuck. Then I get ready to work the Matchbox 20 concert. I promise that I am going to go to sleep as SOON as I get home and I am not going to get up until I have to go to work on Sunday. Old Navy did not schedule me at all for next week, normally I would be happy, but I am trying to save up for a down payment on a new car!. My boyfriend, of 8 months got a new truck last weekend, and now I am on a kick too I want a Ford Focus. All I do is get on the Internet and look at cars when I should be studying, because my parents said they would only help me with the car if I did well in school. Therefore, I need to concentrate on SCHOOL. I am such a busybee, I need to do a load of laundry before the weekend rush begins. I am sure sometime you lived in a dorm too it is hell trying to do laundry. Bat5hing might b nice, I am sure that when I was on the bus earlier that I STUNK badly. Oh well, the people on the bus didn't smell to hot either. I have a test next week in my Geography class and I need to study for that too. AHHHHHH, college is all about managing your time and not getting behind. (which I am). I should have listened during all of those sessions about how to succeed in school, because I doubt that I am doing very well right now. I really wish that I could go home next weekend because my mom is going to be in the hospital, she has to have a hysterectomy??? I have no clue if I spelled that right. I think that it would be so sweet if I showed up in Houston and brought her flowers and all of that good stuff. I love her so much and if it wasn't for her I don't know what I would have done. I guess this weekend I will go buy her a card and prepare to go home this weekend. I know that I might not get an hours next week, but that is OK, because I really don't need any money anyway, like I said, I am trying to save up for a new car. Right now I don't have anything going through my mind other than. SLEEP, and food. And a shower, all of the necessities of life. Well my twenty minutes is almost up, only four minutes to go. I am such a slow typist. I hope this concert is worth all of the work, because I am dead tired. I probably should be going to sleep instead of going to the concert but, oh well. It is a great opportunity to see the show for a little work. I am sure that makes sense to anyone, right? My room is such a mess, my roommate and I really need to clean it. Unfortunately, my twenty minutes are up, and I am going to go to BED!  "
Tell me about yourself.,"I don't really know how to start a ""stream of consciousness"" writing, but I guess I will write about how I feel about college right now. It is my first year and it is really scary but fun at the same time. I guess I haven't really had enough time to sit down and think about all that I have done since I have been here. It is exhausting to think how much I have actually been doing. I'm not a morning person so my days start around 11:00. From that point on I do not stop until about 23am, when I pass out. My days are filled completely with going to class, studying, meetings, and then of course going out. I have met so many people since I have been here. I barely remember anyone's name. I feel so bad when someone comes up to me and calls me by my name and I can't even remember ever meeting them. I'm sure that has happened to everyone before, but it seems to happen to me at least once a day. Oh well, life goes on. At least I remember my roommate's name. She is cool! We both went potluck and got extremely lucky. We get along like sisters, and people even think we look alike. It's crazy. This writing seems like a bunch of gibber gabber but I guess I am following the guidelines by writing what is on my mind. I think this is a cool exercise because it is actually giving me the time to sit down and think about what's on my mind. One thing that is always on my mind is how I miss home. I am used to my mom always taking care of almost everything for me. That makes me sound like a baby, but I am an independent person. I took care of my mom for two years while she was in bed sick. That was the point in my life when I grew up really fast. I had to go to work and school, cook dinner, go to the cleaners, and everything that I could do to help out around the house. When she got better, I guess is when I became lazy and wanted her to help me do a lot of things. She is awesome and I really miss her. My dad is an entire different story. He lives in Connecticut and does not do one thing for anybody except himself. He didn't raise us so he doesn't really know how to act like a father. My step dad is the man who acts as my father. He takes care of me the way my father is supposed to. I really miss him as well. If it weren't for him I would not be typing this essay on this computer, or going to the University of Texas as well. I am very thankful for everything he has done for me. I am bad at showing it sometimes, but I think he knows in my heart how appreciative I am. Another thing that I miss is my sister. She goes to Boston College. I tell her everything because she is my best friend. I don't know what I would do without the telephone. She makes me feel better whenever I have a problem or am upset. I guess this entire essay is about how much I miss my family. I am thinking that maybe I should go home soon and visit. Actually that could be bad, I need to grow up someday. I have two more minutes that I have to write. I feel better about being away from home now that I have expressed what I miss on paper. I have always heard when you write things down it makes you feel better, and this just proved that to me. I hope this makes some since. Goodbye have a good day! "
Tell me about yourself.,"wow! I'm not much on typing for 20 minutes, but I love to write emails to my friends. so I guess that that counts. I miss them so much, they are my friends from camp. I get to see them this weekend, and I cannot wait. my roommate likes to listen to music while she studies and that is the only conflict that we ever have, I guess that I just need to say something to her, cause I'm sure that she doesn't care. well, actually, I know that she doesn't. I hope that I can fit everything into my schedule that I need to, cause I have a lot on my ""to do list"". haha, I'll try! that's all I can do. this whole new responsibility thing is something that I thought would be less than it is. I mean, I thought that I was pretty responsible, but I'm guessing that now I'm not. you learn new things about yourself everyday. but, I'm glad that my parents raised me that way that they did. I miss them. but that's ok, cause I have so many new friends down here that I don't know what to think. I've had some dates, but nothing GREAT and way exciting so far. I guess that I'm picky but that's a good thing. maybe God will just bless me w/ some amazing guy while I'm hear at school well, it doesn't have to be this year cause I have too much going on right now. haha, ok. my phone rings way to much. and people are always stopping by, like about 5 people just walked in my door. I need to catch up on my quiet times. yep, I do. I wish that I could control how much I eat, well, I guess that if I keep on telling myself that, then I need to take some action. well, self, listen. I hope that my interest grows stronger in my nursing major cause its kind of vivid right now. anyway, all this nutrition talk makes me think about eating right and working out and stuff. I need to shave me legs. ok, all this homework is quite an overload. I really like my room, I think that it reflects my personality. I change my thoughts a lot. I expected that when I would write this, that I might just write about one thing, but I keep thinking about a lot of things. I guess that I didn't think about it too much, cause I get distracted very easily. they are in there talking about brittney spears. most people don't like her but I like her. haha, weird for a girl, but I love to dance and sing. I think that she's talented. I hope that I don't have to go back and capitalize all the beginnings of my sentences cause I haven't done it this whole time. now my roommates are joking about their dates. I love to talk to people, they make me happy. well, yea, I really like to talk to people and get to know them. its so much fun. I feel that I'm rambling about absolutely nothing. I wish that I could see the stars here in Austin. but I love when I get to get away cause that's one of my favorite things to do. maybe I'll get a chance to this weekend when I go to a&m. I love how people tell me that they are praying for me. cause I know that pray works. GOD IS THE DEAL! yea pray makes me happy too. being happy can keep anyone going in life. different things make different people happy. I like to find that out about people. God fills me w/ my joy! I really like typing this cause it makes me think about what I am really about. I feel guilty when I make some smart remarks and then I cussed today. which, I never do. that just makes me feel like a piece of junk. ok, I have to go, byebye. :) "
Tell me about yourself.,"At the moment, the only thing that is going through my mind is how I will make it through college if I remain a procrastinator. Thus, I am completing this assignment because I feel that I need to make changes in my study habits. Moreover, I need to succeed at UT because I cannot afford to let my parents down. My parents have worked exceptionally hard to obtain their current status; it would be a total waste of their time and my time and of course, a total waste of money if I fail in college. Thus, failing is not possible. Occasionally, I ponder whether or not my parents see me as a failure. At times, I feel, as though, I am a failure because I am constantly being compared to my older brother. Everything that I do is not good enough and that I should be more like my brother; I guess one could say that I am always in my brother's shadow. Moreover, it is not only my parents that make the comparisons, but my aunts and uncles also make similar comparisons to other family children. Because they do this, I constantly feel depressed for short periods of time. In order to cope with this, I am apt to finding companionship and understanding through several short love relationships. Each of these ""flings"" can be sought as a substitute for happiness. However, I am now more knowledgeable about stuff like that because I know that these relationships are fun and all, but this relationships only make things worse. Not to mention that they only help you obtain temporary happiness. There is one thing good that has come of these experiences; I believe that I have found happiness with another. She makes me happy in all aspects of life and she actually seems to care about me for who I am and not someone else. When I am around her, she encourages me spiritually whether or not she does it intentionally. Surprisingly enough, she actually understands me without having me to explain anything; I guess you can say she's my soul mate, but there is one thing I am sure of, I love her with all my heart. In fact, she has been the only girl I have actually told that I love her and actually meant it. Just thinking about it at the moment makes me smile. "
Tell me about yourself.,"It's hard to believe that my first year of college has begun. It's almost like I am at summer camp for a week, and I will be returning home in a week. However, that is just a false reality in my head. It's hard for me to grasp everything. It seemed to happen so fast. I left behind my family, my friends, my cheerleading squad, my town. Everything that is familiar has been traded in for a world of experience and confusion. What time is my next class? Where IS my next class? Where is everyone going tonight? It's mass confusion in my head. I want to be successful at college: academically, spiritually, emotionally and physically. I have already begun a steady workout and eating habits that make me feel good about my self, and so far I have enjoyed all of my classes. However, there's still that little thought in the back of my head that I am not getting everything done. I feel like there's this list of things to do ALL THE TIME and no matter what I do, I will never get them done. I have to admit, my first week of college was completely awful. I hated every moment of it. I cried everyday, called my mom, acted like a real baby. It was as if there was this strike against me that made sure NOTHING went my way. But as I have gotten used to the schedule and made a few new friends things seem to be looking up. I still feel like I don't fit in. This miniature ""society"" at the University of Texas is like a town within itself, and all of the citizens in this ""town"" seem so superficial. I don't feel like I have met anyone with one natural thought in his or her head. I can't believe how strange it is. It's as if the whole campus is full of sorority girls and fraternity guys. (No offense, it's just not me) I want to feel like a part of things but for the life of me I can't get in ""the loop. "" I make a few friends here and there, but as far as personalities, I feel like I am too real for everyone I have met. I am hoping that by next semester I will begin to make this dorm room my home and the people around me my family. It's not so much that I am homesick as it that I just miss fitting in. Back in High School there were no worries. Everything was laid out for you; only a few minor decisions to be made. I fit in so well. I knew my way around, I knew what was going on at all times; it was like a utopia in my little town of Sugar Land, TX. The only problem with the whole ""high school thing"" is that I was definitely a stereotype. (Another superficial moment in my life) I was a cheerleader all through High School. People at my school assumed I was a snobby, selfish girl who only thought the world of myself as well as my other cheerleader friends. They never even got the chance to know me. I can say right off- I am far from snobby. I love everyone and everything in this world. I am out to harm no one, except my self emotionally every once in a while! Why do teenagers feel the need to be so judgmental of each other? Why is it that I can't drive my Mustang Convertible in my cheerleading uniform without feeling like I am straight out of a ""Saved By The Bell"" episode? I am thinking that over time, an image has been created in everyone's mind on how things should be, and how people should look. Who is to say who and what we are? Why do I feel like I am always answering to someone? I can't make a decision without someone LOVING IT and someone else HATING IT. I hate the fact that the media has pounded into our brains what and who we should be. This is real life people. When you are doled out your genes-physical and personality-you don't get a choice. Some people honestly can't help the way they are. So why do we take the time to stop and make them feel even worse about their insecurities? I think the answer is within our OWN insecurities. It's sick that people feel better about themselves after putting someone else down. If a girl thinks she has ugly hair, she may announce that ""that girl over there"" has a horrible sense of fashion. Does that take away from the fact that she has ugly hair? I don't think so! So why has it become so necessary to step on whomever it takes to make you look better? My mind is full of these questions. I just know that as long as I am here, I plan to stay the real, down to earth girl that I am, as to not become a victim of my own insecurities. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now, as I am writing this paper, I am thinking that I have a lot reading to do this coming up weekend for the following week's classes. I have a pounding headache, which I believe I got while walking to and from my Spanish class because I forgot my sunglasses in my dorm room. Otherwise, I am looking forward to this weekend. Tonight my boyfriend and I are probably going to sixth street for a little while and tomorrow we are going to the Texas vs. Louisiana football game, the first game of the season. I'm really excited about the football game, but I hope it's not too hot (although I'm sure it will be). My boyfriend's parents are also coming in for the game and they are taking us out to eat for dinner. I'll be glad to have a break from the repetitive dorm cafeteria food. On Sunday, I'm meeting my friends who goes to Southwest and we are going to Schlitterbahn water park. I'm having a hard time writing this because my head really hurts. I took two Aleves, but I suppose they have not kicked in yet. While I do my homework I always have to have some kind of noise, whether it be music, television, or a fan, to be able to concentrate on what I am doing. When it is completely silent my mind seems to wander from what I am writing or reading and I end up thinking about something completely different, then looking back at the paragraph I just read and asking myself ""what did I just read?"" I hate when I do that because I feel like I just wasted 10 minutes of my time and I don't even know what I was doing while wasting. I don't know. That probably didn't make much sense at all. At the moment, my fan is on, my radio is playing, and my roommate is talking to her mom on the telephone, so there is plenty, almost too much, noise going on around me. I really am enjoying this assignment because it just puts everything that you think about for 20 minutes onto a piece of paper. When I look at it I think that I must be a slow typist because I thought I think about a lot more things in 20 minutes than this. It has now been 20 minutes so I am ending my paper and trying to think of a good way to end it but it is not coming to me at the moment. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Just sitting here and I decided that this would be a good time to write my stream of consciousness. I'm usually tired and don't feel like doing anything, but tonight I have this extra kick of energy (maybe it's the Lone Star). I've got MTV in the background. I swear all I've been hearing about is the Video Music Awards. Well. they'll finally be coming to TV tomorrow night. We had a hall meeting tonight to talk about the Fire Sprinkler Installation, but we didn't go. We decided to go to the one Thursday night, because my roommate was talking to her boyfriend. I always just sit there and listen to her talk. I wish I could talk to my boyfriend! I haven't talked to him for so long. let's see. since Friday night! I swear our relationship is so strange. We hardly ever get the chance to talk or see each other. I get mad at him during this time because I feel like he's not trying to put anything into the relationship, but the minute I start talking to him I forget about all those feelings. I'm just so happy to hear his voice that I don't care about anything else. He's supposed to be coming to Austin this weekend. I bought him a ticket to the 101 XFest. I haven't even bee able to tell him that he has one because he's never home so that I can call him. Oh well! I'm so excited that I get to see him soon. All of a sudden my thinking process stopped. I don't know what to write. This is how I usually feel when I get a writing assignment. My brain just freezes up. I put it off until l the very last minute. I absolutely dread having to take English next semester. I wish that I had tried a little harder on the AP English exam I took my junior year. I scored a 2 the minimum score you can get is a three to test out of it. I remember sitting in the biology lab room, it stunk like formaldehyde frogs. I have no idea why that's where we took our test. It took so long! On the last essay I wrote one sentence and then gave up. I wasn't thinking that scoring a good grade on this test would save from having to take English in college. Blah! Blah! Blah! I can't stop yawning. My eyes are starting to hurt from this bright computer screen. Ok it's 9:12. I can stop now. "
Tell me about yourself.,"It is 11:30 in the morning. I had a nine o'clock class and I should still be asleep. Naureen should be home soon, I have to remember to tell her that the bank called. I don't think anyone should call before noon. I need to find something to wear tonight I wander if Naureen has anything I could borrow. I can't believe I'm still hungry I have been eating so much. I guess this is how people get their freshman fifteen. I wonder why housekeeping is here on Monday. I think that it would be better if they came on Monday every week. I don't really like getting up on the days I have a late class. I wish I knew what was wrong with my computer. I also wish I could fix it by myself. I wonder if Marty is going to call. I hope he had a good Birthday. Twentytwo sounds so far away but it seems like yesterday he was eighteen. I need to do other homework so bad and I need to make my bed and clean up the closet. I'm so glad I got a clean room mate. I don't think I could have lived with another slob. I wonder how Meagan is doing I should call her and ask if she misses having her own personal maid. 11:40 ten minutes to go. I'm so tired today. If Sten and Tavis come over tonight I'm never going to sleep. I guess sleep isn't that important. I need to talk to mom I wonder if she is still going to San Antonio? I want to see grandma an Aunt Sylvia but I don't know if I can handle a weekend with mom. I guess I can try to get along with her. I hope we go shopping I really need some winter clothes or I going to shiver my butt off all winter. It is cold in here right now but there is nothing I can do about it. The thing is already turned up as far as it will go I don't think it works. I think they only put the thermostat in each room so you think you have control because it is always cold. If the phone rings one more time I'm going to freak. My phone I so loud you can hear it all the way down the hall. It scares me every time it rings. Halloween will be here soon That and New years are the best holidays. I'm going to have to find a costume. Ok its been twenty minutes I'm going to sleep this was interesting and I don't feel like I wrote enough but these were my thoughts. "
Tell me about yourself.,"As I begin to write this essay, I am thinking of what my mind is doing in preparation for writing. I began going through ideas that have come to me earlier this day, trying to find one that I might be able to write about for 20 minutes. I can hear the TV on in the background. It's Monday Night Football, so my mind continues to convince my eyes to look over to my left and look at the teams that are playing. However, I know that I need to write this essay, so I have made a pact with myself not to look over until I'm done. I am occasionally checking my watch to see how long I have been writing. I started at 8:03pm, so I will be done at 8:23. Dennis Miller's voice is somewhat distracting since he doesn't sound like the normal, professional voice of a sports announcer, and I laugh at his jokes only because they are not that funny. Now I'm trying to think of something else, only because I know this essay was meant to show what my mind thinks of on it's own, and not my personal opinion of the football game on TV. I temporarily blanked out, and there was nothing I could think of to write, so I stopped and stretched my hands and neck. Even though I am concentrating on the computer screen in front of me, my ears have nothing better to do than listen to the ads. I don't think it's a good thing that I am able to tell there was a car ad on just because of the music playing in the background. However, I suppose that is why advertisers pick certain kinds of music. They're hoping that it will stick in the minds of the viewers and they'll buy that certain product. I do not know the specific car that was just advertised based on the music, but I am sure that it was some sort of truck that was being advertised as a tough, strong vehicle. The idea of advertising reminds me that I want to go into the college of communications. I know I am a creative and artistic person, so I want a career that will utilize my abilities and something that I can personally enjoy. I would love to be involved with an advertising team coming up with ideas for companies, or a sports photographer. In high school, I was the Photography Editor for the school newspaper. I took many photos for the sports section, and I truly enjoyed standing on the sidelines at the football games and taking pictures. By being so close to the players, I got to understand their true size and feel the emotions going on during the game. Now that I've seen what that's like, I know that when one watches a game from the stands, they are missing out on some of the action and emotion. However, after going to the UT game this past weekend, I realized that the crowd has its own vibe that is also fun to be a part of. As that streak of thought came to an end, I glanced down at my watch and noticed the time was merely 30 seconds away from 8:23, so by now my time is done. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, I'm supposed to write down any and everything I am feeling or thinking right now. The truth is I am totally stressed out today and can't wait to finish this assignment so I can go home and relax and enjoy my wonderful weekend ahead. I have many things to be stressed out about right now. First of school, I'm trying to get my gpa up so I'm having to do just perfect in anything I do for my classes to get into the nursing school. This is my 4th year at UT and you would think I would have my life together by now. Although it's getting there, slowly but surely. To add to my stressful life is my exboyfriend of 2 years who just moved to California so that he can ""find himself"". Whatever. But it's weird because I feel so much happier now that I am no longer with him. It's kind of like I'm a totally different person. I don't hang out with our usual crowd. It seems that I have changed for the better. Also adding some stress into my life is all my expensive bills I have to pay. Phone, electricity, rent, gas, food, beer, etc. One thing I am so grateful for is my wonderful family. I'm proud to say that my parents did a hell of a job raising my 14 year old sister, my 12 year old brother, and of course me the rookie 21 year old. I am so proud of them and their accomplishments. The reason I say this is because they had me, the first born, at a really young age (high school) and to see how well they are doing, unlike many others who start off on a bad foot. And then of course I have my wonderful grandparents who would do anything for any of their three grandchildren. Especially me since I was the firstborn hahaha! Well, I'm trying to think of what else I can tell you about myself in the remaining 10 minutes of this assignment. I will say that I do enjoy this class very much and want to acknowledge Prof. Pennebaker's excellent teaching skills. He makes the class so interesting you never want to miss his lectures. As a matter of fact, my exboyfriend to this class and he recommended I take it. Well, I have 6 minutes and I'm trying to think of what else I can inform you on about my wonderful life. Well, I'm from Victoria, TX. (pop. 66,000) My family still resides there. It's funny to see my little brother going to the same junior high I did with all the same teachers. And I can't believe my sister is a freshman also. I remember those days. I wish I could go back to when life was so simple. But no, now it's time to grow up and see what God has planned for me. I can't wait. I pray that each day he's by my side and helping me in any and every way possible. Guiding me to tomorrow. Well, I guess my time is up. I think in the past 20 minutes you guys at the psychology dept. can figure out a little about me by what I just wrote. Hopefully the data will be interesting. Thank you once again for your time. Hopefully I have written some interesting thoughts for you and I can't wait to see how my results turn out. Or do I even get to???? "
Tell me about yourself.,"So, I am supposed to write about what thoughts are going through my head now, all right. I am wondering about this class, I have only heard good things about it except for the fact that it is hard to get an 'A' in it. I really hope that I can because I am trying to make a 4. 0 this semester, to start off college on the right foot. I feel like a dork because at my dorm everyone goes out every night and I stay home and read well last night I just goofed off most of the night because I couldn't concentrate. Since I don't know what to expect on our first college tests I am going to make sure that keep up to date with my school work. I had a lot of fun at the Delt Pledge party this weekend though, I was a time that I went out and it was worth it. I just saw that my clock on my bedside table is 5 minutes faster than my computer; I will need to fix that in a minute because I know the computer is right. It felt better outside this morning there was a breeze and it wasn't too hot. The football game is going to be horribly hot but I can't wait! I really need to get back into typing. I mean that I have been making a lot of typos I hope that I am catching them. I am listening to Simon and Garfunkle I love them, one of my best friends, Hilary and I used to always sing to ""Cecilia"". Hilary goes to Tech; I haven't talked to her in a while. I need to make some phone calls to my high school friends but I am sort of overwhelmed right now with school. It will be better tomorrow because I only have 2 classes tomorrow and 1 on Friday. Monday I have 4 classes, that is going to be killer! It's been nice since we haven't had a Monday class yet, though. I went to aerobics today and didn't get a very hard work out so I tried to go to Gregory but I forgot that it isn't opened until after 12:05 on weekdays because they have class in the weight room. I went to the CoOp to return 2 books but the worker told me that I needed to bring another receipt so I'll have to back tomorrow. I have been trying to stay on campus on days that I have classes with breaks that are 1 hours or less between classes. That makes me read and eat lunch outside and so I don't waste time walking home and back to class. It is a good plan but by the end of the day I am very tired. I like this writing assignment. It make me aware of what I think about randomly I guess that is the point of the project. I want to see the movie ""Bring it On"" it's a cheerleader movie. I heard it was corny but that I would like it I cheered in high school and so I guess it's a given that I would enjoy anything of this sort. I can't wait to watch the cheerleaders, dancers, and band at the football game I love football too. It's weird to me that the transition from high school to college hasn't been a bigger deal to me. It sort of feels like I am at camp. I like it here. Oh, it's been 22 minutes! Bye "
Tell me about yourself.,"As I begin writing this I am a little annoyed because I'm doing it on my friends computer mine is broken. I wish I could just get my computer to work and be dependable. Also as I'm typing I'm thinking ahead as of what to say I guess I shouldn't do that or maybe that's just the way I think. The phone just started ringing but I'm not even going to answer it. I've been laying around all night watching a movie with a girl I used to like a lot. She's a beautiful girl and part of me still likes her but oh well. Things are different now and I don't really mind that. Also I've recently decided that I didn't want to be in a fraternity. I always thought I would, but really it just wasn't my thing. Right now I'm kind of kicking myself because I'm missing out on partying, but at the same time I hated the amount of time I spent doing stuff at the house. I felt like every one was here to party and study on the side. I wish I could do that but I can't, I need to do well in school. This weekend is Dave Matthews and I'm very excited. The concert is two nights and I'm going to both. Dave is my favorite musician and I've been looking forward to it for a long time. Also it is very hot in this room where I'm typing I wish that I could just some how make it like fifty degrees in here. I really like the cold weather and am looking forward to a break from the heat in the upcoming months. I think I like the cold because I'm hot natured, but also because I have good memories of winters. I love to reflect on the Christmas with my grandparents. As I glance down at my watch I see that my time is almost up so I guess I'll try to muster something great up. I don't know I'm a blank. I do however miss my family a little. I really miss my brother. It's odd because we always used to annoy each other but now I'd really get a kick out of seeing him. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now I am sitting in my dorm room and I just got off the Internet with my old boyfriend, Matt. He is still in Plano and I feel as if part of me is still there with him. The worst of it all is that he has a new life now and he is finding new people and new things to do. Since he is doing this he has found every way to make it very clear that I am not to be a part of this new life he is enjoying so much. Although there is no room for me in this life there is plenty of room for tons of other girls that understand what he is going through. I don't really think that it is fair for him to expect me to just sit here and let him make a new life for himself that I am not in, but he does not seem to understand that because the only circumstance he sees is that I am in college in Austin and that my life must be better than his so there is no need for me to be a part of his boring life in Plano. I pretty much do not think that Austin is that great and I would trade being in college to be with him in a heartbeat. I do not think that he is being fair, sympathetic or a good friend to me at all. He doesn't seem to understand that college is a scary thing and that it really helps to know that there is someone there for you that is a steady constant in your life during a time of constant change, such as this one. He just doesn't understand, and he just doesn't really care. All that he really cares about is that he is having a good time, which obviously cannot involve me. The only thing that he can ever see is that I am in college and that there is going to be so much distance between the two of us. The only thing that he seems to able to do about this is to put even more distance between the two of us. This really bothers me. And the worst of it is that I have been gone for a total of seven days and he has already found a way to replace the void I have left in his life. It makes me feel very wanted to know that I can be replaced in seven days. And the worst of it is that I totally want to be with him every moment of every day and he just doesn't want to be. I feel that if I were to come home for a weekend that he wouldn't even have the time to see me because he would be so busy with some other person. He doesn't even have the time to talk to me for five minutes yet he has time to go to bible study for three hours. He doesn't understand how unwelcoming that college is and how much I would like to have someone right now that really wants me to be there and that really cares about me. This whole situation is very difficult because we are so far apart and there is no way to see each other and there is no way to make him see how much I care about him or how much I really want to be a part of his life. And on top of all of my turmoil with him, I also had to go through rush this week and not get into a sorority. This all makes me feel very wanted and liked by others. So basically my first week of college has been pretty good. I am sick, I have all eight o'clock classes and I am not a morning person, I have been replaced in the life of one of the few people I have ever truly cared for, I have been cut by sororities even though all of the girls in my town have joined the houses of their choice, I live in a really tiny old dorm with a bunch of weird people, and I have broken the brand new portable telephone in my bedroom. Oh well, it can only get better form here, right?  "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am really quite flustered right now, because I already wrote this assignment earlier, and the philosophy systems were probably down, and now I cannot retrieve the file from where I saved it. Anyways, hardly makes a difference though. I can't help wondering about the purpose of this assignment. I mean, the teacher hardly even knows me, and probably cannot even relate to what I am thinking about. I guess this must be a way of doing research, and we'll eventually learn about it. I wish all assignments were just as simple. But its difficult to suddenly get used to this American system of education. This does get strange and intimidating sometimes, with large classrooms and lack of onetoone interaction. But it is nice, and I will definitely get used to it. Today is Monday, and a whole new week lies ahead. I quite dread Monday mornings. not because I have to go to class, but because I have a slight fear of the unknown. what if I have forgotten to do an assignment, what if I annoy a teacher! I am really hungry. I had a small lunch last night. Cafeterias were closed so I made some sandwiches at home. I wish I had a car. Then I could go out anywhere and eat at anytime. I could even go to Sixth Street. I want to buy a sports car. I will buy an Italian sports car once I earn my own million dollars! But that's a long way to go. I want to eat at Kinsolving dining hall today. I am quite tired with the food at Jester. But its pretty far from Jester, and I hate to walk. I guess I'll eat in Jester itself. I wonder what my friends back home must be doing, especially Tanaya. I hope they miss me as much as I miss them. I can't wait to go back to India, but I don't think I'll get to go before summer. I bump into them online almost everyday, so I do feel quite close. But personal meetings are totally different things. My room is such a mess. I will have to clean it up. will do it on Thursday. Thursdays are wonderful. I have only one class, so I do all other work on Thursdays. But this is not a good habit. I eventually end up putting off all my important work to Thursdays, and then run out of time on Thursdays even! I wish the weekend were longer. I need my own computer. I'll get one soon. I hope I get a good deal though. Then I wont have to go to the lab each time I have to do an assignment. My uncle is Dallas said he could get me one for a decent price. I will probably go meet him next week if it fits in my schedule. Great, my 20 minutes are almost up. This assignment was fun. I hope that all the others are as much fun to do. "
Tell me about yourself.,"It's only been a day since this is Monday and I already miss him. Got back from my trip last night and still had to call him I know that I'm not crazy but I wonder if it is bad to need someone in your life. What happens when they leave for some reason? I mean, school seems hard, and I need to think about studying and stuff, but all I want to do is talk to him and spend time with him. He told me once that he needed me. I think that was the best thing I ever heard him say or at least one of the best things he's ever said to me. I just know that this summer was even better than the last something I didn't think could happen. It sucks now though, even though I'm in a whole new place, and even though I should be excited about starting college, all I think about at night when I go to sleep is all the time we spent together this summer, and all the fun we had. Now, even though we are only an hour away from each other I still miss him. I worry about what will come of this semester. Will we stay strong? Or just fall apart because of the separation? We did okay last year and we were five hours away I thought that was hard, but ironically enough being closer to him is harder. That just means that on the weekends, I can tease myself with his presence and make the drive to San Antonio to see him, or vice versa. But I can't describe the way it feels to make the drive and feel the wind blasting through the car as my favorite songs ring through my ears, and then the excitement I feel as soon as I reach the point. The point that's what I call the restaurant that I pass on the way to San Antonio I believe it's a Marie Callenders  but anyways it means that within the next couple of minutes I will be with him. What does it mean to have a soul mate? I mean, I have heard explanations. but what do you do? How do you know that it's him? It's almost been twenty minutes, and I think I'll just keep typing, until I can leave the computer and study, finally. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am sad. I just started thinking about the dog I left behind in Katy, Texas. That isn't exactly why I am sad though. It seems weird to me that I am really missing my dog and hardly ever thinking about my mom and dad. It isn't that I don't love my mom or dad but something must have gone wrong considering this is my first time away from them and I am hardly talking to them at all. If my mom sends me an email is usually says something like: nothing new here, Mickey's now. Mickey is my dog. I really feel like my dog is more important to my mom then I am. At least she has always spent more time with him. I am getting teary eyed which is weird because I haven't cried in years and I don't think I have anything to cry about now. My roommate's mom calls him every single night. I have talked to her more then I have talked to my mom since I have been here. I haven't heard a word from my dad at all. Oddly enough I don't really miss my friends back home. We have been very close since sixth grade and I just left them. For some odd reason this really doesn't bother me. I can't stop thinking about how much your class stresses me out. It seems so easy. I know it won't be easy though, and that makes we question how much time I should be spending on it now. I almost had a panic attack when I saw that the website was down but it is now back up and that makes me feel okay. I am really hungry which is weird because I just ate a piece of ham, a piece of turkey, sweet potatoes, a piece of pecan pie, broccoli and cheese, and a Neapolitan ice cream sandwich. Isn't that nuts. Hopkins 24/7 is now on. That is an awesome show. It really hits hard without showing gruesome ER scenes (it is a documentary series). I lost my train of thought and I am now writing about nothing. Well, my twenty minutes are up. Bye. "

Tell me about yourself.,"Wow. I have a lot of books. Ok, it's about 10:04. I tried to start this thing a while ago, around 8, but my girlfriend is over, and I'm helping her learn German. I've had a lot of German classes. Anyway, I'm going to marry her. Sometimes I'm afraid of the commitment, and the choice, but every time I'm with her, she makes me feel confident. When we go play tennis, study (as we are doing right now), or just about anything really. Hmm. Hsinju got the job at the NOC. I don't know if Bobby is just putting on a kind facade or what. SO many guys are like that. Maybe females, but I never really know. But guys are. They are great and pleasant until they're in the company of other men. Wasn't that a movie? In the Company of Men. Yes. Had a yellow and red cover to it, I think. Speaking of which, I need to watch those videos from Vulcan. What a great place. Cheap too. No quite as cheap as my dad's though. I wonder what RPM is going to be like when the evil giant faceless megacorporation finally gets its butt in gear. It seems like I've spent my entire life fighting against corporate america. Fuck Blockbuster, fuck Starbucks. But now that they have bought out RPM Records. well, I'm glad my dad can retire in ease with all that dough. But I feel like I've betrayed myself. How can I be so gleeful about it? Sure, RPM fought the system, and won. we never went out of business. Several times, the megacorporations had to buy us out, not boot us out. But it's kind of like becoming a traitor for some quick cash. Like Judas. That was one hell of a Judas Kiss. $250,000. Wow. Anyway, I really hope my semester pans out well. I'm really liking the idea of the English Teacher class I'm taking. THe teacher seems friendly. Reminds me a lot of Mrs. Hagar. And what luck, a german in there too! Woher aus Deutschland kommst du, mein neue Freund? I think it will be exciting to get to practice my german. THat reminds me, I need to go drop that GER 218 class I'm taking. I don't think I'll really like it. And I can get enough practice helping Stacey anyway. I wonder what I should add. So much is riding on these up coming semesters. Did I mention I love my baby? I'm going to propose to her sometime in October. On a hot air balloon, with a large banner on the ground that says, ""Will You Marry Me?"" I think it will be great. So romantic. Except for the balloon operator. Stacey has low self esteem though, at least when it comes to academia. She's so smart, but she just needs to practice. At whatever. SHe's goofy too. So much fun. I'm actually getting a bit tired. I've been writing for about ten minutes now. I think I want another drink. That crangrape juice was good. Hmm. Sleep would be good. Tennis would too. I think I'm too tired for tennis tonight. I may fall asleep during the movie. Studying and writing is tiring. I don't miss home. Garland, that is. Austin is great. So much better than that rotten place. Everyone there, my age at least, had one single goal: undermine everyone else. Ugh. It's been 20 minutes. Bye. "
Tell me about yourself.,". It's amazing how much my mood differs by my surroundings or situations. Currently I'm ecstatic because I just found out that my soccer team may be going to Clemson College and that is where my best friend, Kristen McKinney is going to school. I miss her SO much! When I think of her I never have any bitterness or resentment in my heart, but rather gratitude that God brought her into my life. With my constantly shifting moods and feelings, she was always a pillar of strength and stability, the most loyal friend I have ever had. I had so much trust in her, that many times I found myself dependent on her when I needed a listening ear or a shoulder to cry on. I remember a time when I was at my other best friends house and we had a discouraging talk about how I felt her boyfriend was consuming her life. Immediately after I left I drove two blocks to Kristen's house and there she was ready to listen and pray with me. People say that the deep friendships are formed in college, but I know that the friendship Kristen and I have can't get much more intimate than ours. Through out high school we ran cross country and had classes together, therefore we knew every event happening in each other's lives. That's why it's so hard not having her here with me to share the experience of college with. Although I miss her dearly, self pity will not consume me because I am confident that God has prosperous plans for me at UT and Kristen at Clemson. Also this will each me to become completely dependent on Christ and His promises and not on fleeting things of this world. I really hope that I will not become hardened by the sin that is in me and surrounds me daily. Already I find myself not making time to be in the Word, which is the armor I need to remain strong against the enemy. I can relate with Paul who can't understand why he does the very things he despises. But glory be to God who makes me free of guilt through Jesus. Why He chose me, I have no idea. My mind can only take so much of seriousness, then it wanders back to funny Chris Farly lines or petty worries of the day. Already I am thinking of other assignments I need to complete after this and of how I need to get in touch with certain people. Yet we are suppose to live our lives a prayer to God, and I have such trouble letting Christ shine out of me when I am running errands, or standing in lines, or in class. Lord, please make me a bondservant to serve You daily on this campus or where ever I am and who ever I run into. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Sometimes I think that maybe I need to make some changes to my life. Almost everyone I meet in my life think I'm too shy or too quiet. Personally I think I just don't like to talk. I tend to stand aside and listen or observe what is being discussed. Sometimes those who don't know me well get the wrong idea that I don't like talking to them. A lot of my good friends from high school think that I've changed since I came to college. They say I've learned to open up more to people. I think I'm still the same person though. I guess when a person moves into a college environment it's kind of hard not to talk to people. I mean we're always meeting so many people everyday. I guess another thing I feel like I need to change is my stress level. I tend to stress out very easily. Anything from school problems to things happening at home could make me nervous. I always feel so tense. It's as if everything is going by so fast and I don't have enough time to complete everything I need to do at once. When I'm around my family I usually try not to show them how stressed I am. However when I'm with my friends it's pretty obvious if I'm stressed out. I become moody easily and don't have an appetite. The last two years of college were stressful for me. I didn't know what I wanted to do in my life. I felt that everyone around me had a plan or goal they were working towards. For me, I couldn't find what I really liked. I tried talking to different people but it never really helped. Actually the main problem was myself. I'm always so indecisive. If someone was to ask me to choose between two things, I wouldn't know which one to choose from because I felt both were equally good or bad. "
Tell me about yourself.,"As I begin this assignment, I'm not sure what to say. I really never write my thoughts down. Maybe I should. I want to play halflife, but I can't. It seems I don't have enough hours in the day to do everything I want to. Maybe I should be better in my time management. But I think I'm pretty good as it is. I always try to plan out my day, making sure I have enough time for everything. Shoot, I can't believe I misplaced my bracelet, Laine gave it to me. She's so sweet. There's a speck of dust on my calendar. I better pick it up and throw it away. I've made a pact with myself to learn how to type correctly on a keyboard. No cheating whatsoever. It is really weird. But I think I'll grasp it eventually. I was just thinking about my trumpet. I', not in any band here, but I still like playing my horn. I just wish I had the time for it. That really pisses me off. Hopefully, after I firmly get adjusted, I can figure something out. I was just thinking about Saurin, when I went to his place a couple of nights ago. He's such a funny son of a bitch. I had a good time. I wish his place had better lighting, though. its too dark. But I like the living room action. This dorm is very restrictive; I can't wait until I get an apartment. I'm sick of walking to a dining hall for food. And I really want to eat meals with meat in them. I got to finish my math work. Maybe I'll invite Matt over again, Darren's coming over after 6:30. I just have a couple of problems to work out, but then there is the new section. I probably should do most of that tonight so I can ask the TA some questions. That one guy got number 30. But he'll be there tomorrow, so that's cool. Man what's that other guy's name  yellow hat boy  Starts with a G, Garge or something. I checked my answers with him this morning. Most of them were right, thank God. I just hope I can pull something good in this class. I'm determined to work hard. God willing, I won't end up like some of my friends. Man I'm tired. I always seem tired. I don't know why. Four more minutes. this backspace key next to the spacebar is so convenient. I don't have to pick my hand up whenever I make a mistake. That just goes to show how lazy I am. Mofo action lazy. I got a reply from Russell today, I was so glad, I miss him, I miss a lot of people. I guess it's going to take me a while to find people like those I left behind in high school. They were so good in so many ways. There's music playing. oh well, time's up. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Dear Sir or Madam: I am writing to inform you of my recent achievements, thoughts, feelings, and general relevancy of life. I have been under some stress for the last few months due to recurring repercussions of the recent divorce of my parents. I am and have always been one who stands and is ready to be strong for others, but some time it takes more strength to cry. I am glad that my involvement in dancing had led me to this time so near my departure for the Olympics. This had helped to separate me from the hectic antics of family. Although it has given to great an amount of time to reflect upon my inefficiencies. Again as I type I am thinking I am wondering as if this incoherent gibberish will be or can plausibly be translated into recognizable human thought and used in my aid. This in itself has become a major threshold of relief for me. Confrontation of my fears has always been a struggle. Fears a plague of man for centuries, we can find cures to anything but be most tormented by nothing more than our own conscious being. See, as I continue I have diverged farther and continued in my pursuit of happiness and my race against fear. I fear that I am losing control. Not of myself but of family. They stray farther and farther from the objective, but seem to relentlessly ignore the many warnings and offers of aid from their peers. Is it true that we are not safe from torment even without villain, or can it be that the most prevalent villain be he who lives within us. Tearing at each muscle and heartstring, pulling our every emotion straight from the gates of happiness to the pits of despair. I've dug myself into this hole and finally confessed, but the only my own strength can bring me out. Ironic isn't it. I am not nearly psycho or even remotely suicidal, but life can bring one down. A carefree person is at the greatest risk, because it is with that lack of care that you neglect to watch for the advance of the ranks of despair. I have yet to find the reason or meaning behind any so feelings. Let alone answer any thoughts or feelings of my own, but simple writing forms a haven, safe place, or a virtual escape from the locks of my own mind. Only as I overcome the fallacies that I have founded my realities upon, may I escape the shackles of my own torment. I really have no problems, other than an overly kind heart and mind that troubles me more than worth. How can I escape my own shackles when it is by the same power that I am confined that I am held captive. My thoughts are low and stamina lost but open freely now are the gates of hope. Once again proving that the pen is far mightier than the sword. "
Tell me about yourself.,"""Today is the first day of the rest of your life"" is what I remember my parents saying to me at graduation two years ago. Back then, I was having some serious problems and nobody, including myself, knew what to do. But now, after that wild madness of that first semester in 1999 all has seemed to calm down. I don't know what it was that did it. Perhaps it was that one acid trip that I took at last year's Phish concert. Man, its annoying when that red line pops up under misspelled or misrecognizied words. Makes you feel selfcritical. I don't know how I feel now. Ever since this year began, I've been a little more tired than usual. But, I've been a little stressed out, too. Not about classes; naw, they all seem to be just fine. Enjoyable, too. Having sex with that girl Sue was a bad move, though. First of all, she's kind of nuts. I know she's lonely, too. Must be tough coming all the way from California here, but at least her family's from Texas. She's fucked up, though, because she's searching for something outside of herself that's impossible to find: security and peace of mind. It's impossible to really, really find those two things in this world I think. I mean, security's a joke; there are so many factors that we never think about in our daily lives that kind of jab at our illusions. All those things like high paying jobs, retirement funds, etc. are all about security. Personally, I think it's all a bunch of bullshit, but, then again, I'm not an old man nor do I have a family to support. I hope this girl doesn't get racked up. I'm pissed because she told me that she was on birth control, but that was a lie. And, I know that if I'd gotten some loving in the last three years I wouldn't have done it. I used her and I feel rotten for it. But, her desire for something to hold on to and peace of mind are making her irrational, I fear. Somehow, she identifies these two things with me. Don't really know why, because I never really thought of myself in those two ways realistically, but I never said there was anything rational to her thoughts. Man, I hate complaining, but I got to say that I've had some bad luck with women these last few times. First there was Lexi. I'm not really sure what was going on between the two of us, but I'm sure I loved her in some way. Can't speak from her end of the line, though. The problem was just that towards the end of last year when we were on the rocks, I was starting to go mad, and it's hard to handle a distant woman and insanity at the same time. That's kind of a lame excuse, but what else can I say? I haven't really gotten that far yet, though Lord knows I've tried. I was thinking the other day about whether or not I fear women overall. Well, I sure like to talk and think about them a lot. My mom was always such a hard ass on me growing up. I know she loved me a lot, although I hate to admit it, and I guess that's why she was. Or, maybe it was because of her upbringing. Anyway, nonetheless, I've been afraid of her forever and I'm ashamed because I think it fucks up my deal with other women and I really have a hard time deciding if I love her or not. I know it's my ""duty"" or whatever that means, but do I really? Of course I do on some level, but, man, I always get all tearyeyed when I even start thinking about it. That's another thing: I haven't been able to cry in a good, long while. Oh well, c'est la vie. My friend Elizabeth comes to mind now. I wonder how she's doing up there in NY. We have a really weird relationship, and it really hurt when I learned that she liked Matt for a long time. Guess I always had a little something for her. That was a great time up at the Doubletree last Christmas, though, I will say. Mr. A footing the entire bill, too. I guess Townes Van Zandt does have it right when he said, ""We all got holes to fill, and them holes are all that's real. "" Last night, I learned about some of Manny's holes concerning his father. He sure has been acting differently lately, though. It must be tough, but I don't know how to handle it. Maybe it's just best to let him be for a while. I kind of liked that Emily girl I met last night as well. I guess that statistic that says that men think about sex/women every 30 sec or so is right; the majority of this writing's about them. Or, maybe I just have some complex or something. Probably a combo of the two. I don't know what to think about God these days. I sure have been praying a lot to Him lately, though, over this Sue pregnancy thing. God, I hope that works out for me. I know it's selfish, but, man, You've got to understand. I truly am sorry, and I'll never have sex with another girl again on a onenighter. Lord, hear my prayer. Amen. Our society's kind of funny these days. If there is a man upstairs, I hope he's having a good time. It's amazing how fucked up stuff can get down here, though. After high school, I mean. Sometimes it's hard to be a man, and a woman I'm sure. I wonder who's got it worse. ""Sucede que me canso de ser hombre. "" It just so happens I'm tired of being a man, says Octavio Paz. I guess we all feel like that sometimes. Well, I guess my 20 minutes is up, but I do like this. Maybe we'll talk again sometime. See you, man. Take care and good luck. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I completely forgot that I had a discussion group for Philosophy today at 12, so I went out last night with the intentions of being able to sleep in all day today, but no. Luckily my roommate is in the same class and reminded me, so now I am awake. Since I have been here I have never spent the night completely alone in our room. However, this weekend I have to stay in town for some dumb sorority match and retreat, while one of my roommates goes home to Houston, one to Dallas, and the other is always at her boyfriends. So this weekend I will be sleeping here all alone, which kind of sucks. I used to always stay home alone, for weeks at a time. But it will be weird to stay here alone, since I have been here all of three weeks. Right now I am on the phone with the Health Center people, because I woke up with a swollen eye, which doesn't feel to great, so I am about to go take care of that. It is really annoying, it isn't painful, just a constant pain. Another thought on my mind lately has been one of my friends; he is also my date to the OU game in a couple of weeks. About a week ago he depledged from his fraternity cause it wasn't for him, he isn't the normal frat guy. However, the other morning when he came to pick up my ID he was wearing the outfit that they have to wear for their pledgeship. When he depledged I had a lot of respect for him because he never does things on his own, and while all his friends were pledges he wasn't. When he said he was back in it worried me. I think it is just because he is bored because none of his friends are ever there, so he is all alone. But we will see how that goes. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now I am realizing how tired I am after such a long day of work. I worked all day today and I think I have sneezed at least 100 times. I wonder if I have allergies. My kitten is crawling across the keyboard. Man, do I type really slow or what. I probably won't be able to type very much in 20 minutes. I am really frustrated with by boyfriend right now. I think that must be a ""woman thing. "" I don't know. Maybe I am a little hard on him. I don't know. I just really wish he could be more open with me a communicate with me better. I really wish he would tell me how he truly feels about me and about us. I am so frustrated with it all. I be psychologists get a lot of complaints about men from us women. I am really sure of that. I am really realizing that men don't communicate very well about relationships. Unless you are talking about football or cars, you might as well forget. it. I really don't know how to take his comment this weekend that he likes cars better than he likes women. I really take offense to that comment. I really think that that is personally directed to me. I don't know. I know he is not sure about us and I pray all the time that he will know how he feels about things and us, but so far that prayer is sill out there. I really don't know what to do now. I am not trying to make him choose me or hit the road, but I just don't want this to drag on for five years of my life and then end. I just don't want to waste any more time in my life. I know if I would have stayed with my high school boyfriend, we would probably be married by now and maybe even be happy, but things never felt complete with him and I am so glad that I realized that back then. With Stephen, things feel so much more real and I really think that is why things have seemed so much harder. We have been through a lot this past year together. With my whole surgery and illness, he sure was great. A lot of men that might have to deal with a sick girlfriend going through surgery and IV treatments would run and never look back. Not him. Thankfully God gave him the patience to put up with me and stick things out with me and help me get through such a trying time. This past year really has been a trying one. I was in the hospital numerous times, had about 8 inches of my small and large intestines removed, went through a four month new IV treatment and all at the same time tried to find a medication that would help keep my body in remission. I am thankful that I am now in the remission that I have longed for and I think my doctor has found a successful dosage and mixture of medications that are helping keep me stable. God has answered so may prayers and is continuing to watch over me. Being sick has really opened my eyes to a lot and helped me grow so much as a person. I really have had to grow up dealing with such a horrible illness. Its really hard being 21 dealing with a chronic illness that you know there is no cure for and having to deal with it daily, either by pain or medications or doctors. I think I am down to taking about 17 pills a day now. I was taking about 25. Stephen said I would jiggle when I walked. I think I still do. My doctor is continuing to decrease my medications thankfully. Looking at the clock my time is up. Hope this doesn't bore you too much. Take care! "
Tell me about yourself.,"What is going through my head. hmmm. That's a good question. Well. I feel really skeptical about this whole college thing. I mean its all cool and all but I get a little intimidated by the whole process. I mean all these people in my classes kind of freak me out. I am used to dealing with large amounts of people but WOW. I sit there and wonder how the professors do it all. I mean yes, they have teacher's aides, but I am sure that the work is tremendous. All the schoolwork is a little new to me. I am used to a lot of busy work and worksheet. Don't get me wrong. I was in advanced classes, but I am not that used to every class having mandatory readings all the time. I am also a little scared of going out. I was always a social person in high school but the whole going out and meeting new people is a little scary. I mean, the people seem really friendly and nice, but a lot of them seem really snobby and a little unapproachable. so it makes a person hesitate. I am really an outgoing girl but I hesitate for some reason here. In other environments, I usually don't. It is strange though. It like I am afraid of making new friends. How silly is that??? Also, I am afraid of the whole freshman 15 thing. I mean, how could people gain weight? You walk around all day and go to class. And when you're not doing that you are reading or going out? Well, I know the food isn't that great, but 15 pounds! Wow! Also, this whole party scene is a bit intimidating for me. I want to go, but I am so scared because of all the storied I've heard. Funny what you realize when you just sit here and let your mind go. I need to learn to type faster so I can go as fast as I am thinking. Oh well. that's what you get for not taking keyboarding in junior high. Well. I am thinking my 20 minutes of typing is up. So I will check all my spelling and turn this in. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, I hope I'm doing this assignment correctly. I think it might be too easy and that's why I'm having a problem with it! Well my eyelids are very heavy. I'm very sleepy. It's cold in here but I don't feel like getting up and getting a blanket. I really need to do my Chemistry homework also. I'm trying not to procrastinate too much. I'm really bad about that. So I'm attempting to get off on the right foot. I'm bored. I'm looking around the room at my beautiful orange pipe that they installed last week. Just the thought of it makes me angry. I hate typing sometimes because I always hit the wrong keys. Next week is going to be busy. I have to pick E and Ken up form the airport at 2:00 and I get out of my last class at 2:00. As soon as I get back to campus I have to go to a meeting. I hope I'm not late. I don't want to walk in late! I really hate typing! My feet are very cold, I need to get some socks, but I'm not sure if we are supposed to stop. My fingers are cold too. It would probably help if I dried my hair. At least that's what my mom always says. I really need to fix my computer wires. They are a mess! They should put a hole in the back of the desk so the wires can be in the back, but NO that would make too much sense. It has to be difficult! Well I've almost been writing for 10 minutes. Yeah, tem more left! My neck itches. My eyes are getting droopy. That dream I had last night was really good. I don't remember what it was about, but it was good! I wonder why I can never remember my dreams? Maybe I'm just weird. Who knows?. My feet are very cold. I have to get up and get some socks. Ok I'm back. I'm really excited about going to the Matchbox Twenty concert next week. That's another reason I wanted to get this assignment over with. Ooh, I've got six minutes left, I've got six minutes left! Yippee. I guess that's how you spell that. Well my spell checker didn't catch it. So I guess I'm right. I'm not a very good speller, but that's OK. I really want to take a nap this afternoon. I think I'm going to. I'm glad Jennifer's not here. I have the room to myself! That put a smile on my face! I love Cheerios. They are one of my favorite cereals! Ooh, my hair is falling in my face. I hate when it does that. I don't understand why its so cold in here. I hope it doesn't rain tomorrow. I'm excited about going to the game. My hands are cold. I really need to organize my stuff in my room. I'm so glad maintenance fixed my bed! Now I won't fall out in the middle of the night! That makes me happy! I'm sleepy. Maybe it will help if I open the blinds. That blind man in the cafeteria was nice. I wonder what he was doing there. Well my time is up. Ooh, I even went over by a couple of minutes! "
Tell me about yourself.,"Stream of conscience. Just typing whatever comes to mind. I just woke up a little while ago from an exhausting week of this thing called college. I have made many friends, but still looking for that awesome bond, my best friend Brook and I shared. I am from out of state, so meeting people is a must for me. I meet someone new everyday; it's like a mind game that I play with myself. Can I remember his/her name? What crazy way did I try and remember his/ her name? I do want to go back home this weekend. All my friends that went out of state and those who stayed instate are going back home for Labor Day weekend. When I was small I used to spend this weekend up at our little lake cabin with my grandparents and my dad. My dad would drive up/down from wherever he was on business to take my sister and I up to the lake, for one last weekend full of sunshine and sunscreen. The word Sunscreen reminds me of the beach, Florida trips with my mom and stepdad and of course my wonderful little sister. I remember Cara and I would play Uno in the back seat of the pickup all 12 hours to Destin. Goodness writing from my conscience brings back a lot of memories. I am growing up, that's what everyone says anyway when you go off to school. Here I am its hard to believe that I am fully responsible for all of my actions, I have nightmares about not waking up in time for class or dreaming of scary situations with my friends and family from back home. A couple of ""nightmares"" I have had have truly disturbed me even after I awoke. So bad that I had to call back to Arkansas to make sure everyone was okay. Even though I new it was a dream, something inside me made me make sure. Random change of pace, but I am hungry. My favorite thing to eat in the morning is a cinnamon roll, but since I way slept through breakfast this Saturday afternoon, I will have to adjust my system to something much more healthy. My abs hurt when I laugh, they are a constant reminder of my wonderful workout last night. While most everyone was out boozing it up down on 6th street, my friend and I worked out. Seems a little ironic. A little bit of me wonders if I am truly missing anything, just the social aspect of college. I just feel that its okay to do whatever I want, and if I don't feel like getting ready to go out. I shouldn't bother with it, another part of me wonders how can I say no when I never have. I am only seventeen so I use that as an excuse until I turn eighteen at the end of the month, to decide if I want to go out or not. I bought my first football tickets yesterday, the lines weren't all that bad. I just thought this entire drawl process would just be horrible. No big deal. It did make me a little sad/homesick to see all of the groups of friends buying tickets together. Time. Just time and I will also be part of that group. Right? That is what I keep telling my conscience anyway. I am anxious to reread all of these random thoughts from my conscience to see how I jumped from one subject to the next, or even what I did write about. I guess that is your experiment or research on this. I am looking forward to the next class and the research sign ups. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm sitting here listening to a trance cd of jimmy van M who I recently saw at Hyperia in Houston, Texas. As best as I can express my sensations and reactions to this music something will always be left unsaid. The music is a magical, emotional journey that not many people understand. Those that do, however, are purveyors of another plain of consciousness that will forever stay with them. A grammatical explanation is hard to find when most people are entirely withheld from experiences that have the guaranteed potential to alter people's lives. I often think of Teddy Roosevelt's idea. ""Far better it is to dare mighty things than to take rank with those poor timid spirits who know neither victory or defeat. "" I for one am a great example of the power that is contained in some of the things I've experienced. I wish I could really delve into these things sometimes without hesitating with regards to the repercussions. But, then again, the leap of faith is something everyone must do on their own. Someone can only be shown the door. You must have the initiative within to step across it on your own. As much as I've seen and endured I sometimes wonder if I really have seen everything that is the best. Then I remember what I thought before my experiences and I know that there is still so much more out there for me to jump on. Avoiding selfdestruction is also a daunting task sometimes and an everpresent one. One I am no longer fearful of fulfilling. Life really is too short to worry a fraction as much as most people do. This is a cold, hard fact. I'll be damned if I'll be lying on my deathbed reminiscing about all the missed opportunities. I'll croak knowing that I choked everything out of life and then some, and then a little more. "
Tell me about yourself.,"What should I write about?. Anything that pops into my head? Okay. Well, I have to write Edwin email and via snail mail. I told him I'd send the pictures, his copies, of our trip to San Antonio. That was one fun and exciting weekend. I miss him so much. I think of him as much as I do about Jon. But Jon more so, of course. I can't wait to see Edwin again. Mom's cooking really smells good. She's cooking Filipino beefsteak and my mouth is watering. The watercolor picture on the front cover of the PSYCHO text is quite unusual. Looks like one of Picasso's works, but the facial features aren't misplaced. Hmmmm. how much more time do I have? Eh, five minutes have passed. fifteen more minutes to go. I keep thinking about AOL and the internet. I have to catch up with my email writing and AFLS posts. I rarely post in the newsgroup anymore. There are so many newbies and the people in there are rather annoying. Lea posts there, though. That's really nice of her. Very thoughtful lady. But what busts my buttons the most are the continuously unending flow of questions, personal or otherwise, that particular people tend to ask. They probably know more about Lea than they do about themselves. They're so obsessed. I just want to tell them off and give them a piece of my mind, but I'm not that type of person. I like writing this way. It's like a diary or a journal of some sort. I should do this more often. It's quite relaxing. I used to keep a diary. I'd tell it everything, especially how I felt about Edwin when I was younger. about 10 or 11 years old or so. I had the biggest crush on him, to this day, but he never knew back then. He liked me, too, big time. It was only a few weeks ago, when I saw him after 10 years that I confessed. We were both sad that we were never really together, but that night felt like we had been together all this time. for the longest time. It felt so natural  he said so himself. I could replay that weekend for the rest of my life. And we shared so many common interests that I never knew we had before. My, what a story we have. It's like a long lost love affair. This writing assignment is pretty neato. Just writing down thoughts. Putting it into words. I could write a whole novel. HAHA! I'm still thinking of Edwin. But, alas, I am in love with someone else, also a boy from my childhood. I didn't really know him back when I was 10 years old. His family, yes, but not him. It's only during high school that I got to know him and later on fall head over heels for him. It wasn't love at first sight, you see, as in Edwin's case. I eventually fell for Jon and I will remain faithful and loving to him for as long as I shall live. Should I end here? I've got one more minute. Well, it's at least 20 minutes, but I feel like writing more. My mom's cooking smells great. Well, time's up but I'll keep on writing. I need to go to the bathroom, too. So, until next time. This is confidential right? Now, where's that submit button? "
Tell me about yourself.,"I love just being me. Honestly without my personality, I am nothing in this world. There are so many people alive today that without my individuality, I could not survive. It would be too weird if I walked around the streets seeing a splitting image of myself. Hehe I think that I would probably pass out if that ever happened to me. Ouch, my arm really itches right now. Man I hate when I scratch so hard and it leaves marks on my skin. It's so unattractive and it is so annoying when I have to shave over it. I really can't believe that he would say that to her. Doesn't he realize that some things are best left unsaid especially when you don't know the whole story? Fainting has to be one of the most unique experiences that I have ever gone through. It's so weird that you lose all control of yourself for that onesecond. Thank goodness that girl was there to help me even though she didn't know me. I would freak out if I ever came in contact with someone who was about to pass out and fell on me. Man Jessica really can draw. I wish that I had the talent to do something like drawing my selfportrait. My legs are really starting to bother me since they are in that position. Oh man I need to go read my Theater since I have that class tomorrow. What should I wear tomorrow? I wonder if it is going to be as hot as it has been this whole time. I thought it would feel so much better than McAllen. For goodness sakes, at least McAllen has wind. Man what I would give to be at the beach right now without a care in the world sipping on the best tasting glass of lemonade and laying out getting the greatest tan in the world. And the POboys at Blackbeard's. No one makes greater Fantail Special than they do. I really hope my computer comes soon. I can't wait to start adding songs to my computer. Why hasn't my phone rang in a while? I need to call Jessie in a minute. I wonder if I have anything that I need to get done tomorrow. Hopefully my backpack will work out good. Because it was so cheap compared to everything else that was there. I love my shoes and I can't believe that my black ones broke. That was too weird that it happened especially since it was in the middle of the street and I wasn't doing anything that would have made it break normally. I hope my computer is the one I wanted. I wonder who is calling right now? Must be for Amber since she is talking to that person right now. I really feel like watching Hope Floats right now. That is such a great movie, and the guy in it is so hot. "
Tell me about yourself.,"This semester should be one where I define the rest of my life. Working as hard as possible to get into the school of architecture. It is what I have wanted to do for the past 5 years. The fact that I was initially rejected brought me down. But I can't let that hold me down. Hopefully psychology will help me sort out my thought processes. My roommate is being very helpful right now by blurting out random words and playing decent music. I'm pretty fortunate to have a good friend like him. I have known him for the past 2 years. I am also fortunate for having good professors this semester. I don't really have a monotone stiff up on stage reciting the book word for word. I am also fortunate that the girl next to me in psychology class is hot. Hopefully something will come of it. If not there are about 20,000 other cute girls running around on this great campus. I thought this was going to be easy but so far I just can't seem to talk about much. That it was I hate about myself is that I am too shy around people I don't know. People I don know think I am loud and very extroverted but around strangers I don't know how to initiate conversation. There are times though when I don't really care and I seem to make friends with everyone. I have a lot of reading to do but I thought I might as well get this out of the way. I used to do this type of thing in my 10th grade English classes. Mr. Wildman was so cool. My old high school wasn't very good. I guess that is why I only went there for 2 years. I bet there are about 2 million mistakes in this paper once I am done typing this. The psychology textbook is pretty easy reading. That is such a relief because I need to work as hard as I ever had in my entire life and I probably couldn't do it if the books were terrible. I think that after this semester of busting my ass I t help bring me into a routine of busting my ass and making a 4. 0 over the next years will come natural. I believe that the harder you work the better the pay off. Architecture is a field of tremendous work. I have worked with a guy for the past two years. It so good. I have learned more on the job than I think I will ever learn in any classroom. It was a job I was looking forward to going to every morning. He gave me a lot of responsibility this past summer. I was able to organize the El Paso Independent School District fundraiser where I happened to meet a lot of influential people in the society. How much longer do I need to type? This is lasting longer than I thought it would. I guess my head is just empty. I think while doing this I try to hard to put on this thing that I think you want to hear. But since it is just a free thought paper I should just be able to write whatever I want. But for some reason it just isn't happening. I think way too much about things that keep me up at night. I often lie in bed until 4 in the morning just thinking I will be in the next 10 years. I have always had the dream of making it big and becoming some architect who becomes immortal thought his outstanding designs and buying my parents whatever they have always wanted. I think that making my parents proud of me is my ultimate goal in life. Just once to here my dad say, ""that's my son"" in front of a whole crowd of people and for him o be so proud of what I have become and done is the greatest thing in the world. Hopefully I went let him down that is why I come to class. That is why I have to college. This is why I am reading and turning this assignment in days early. I will do whatever needs to be done to get to the top. If I don't I have not only let myself down but my parents as well. But I won't let that happen. This is the place an time to make or break my future and I don't plan I on coming away from the university with anything less then I what I came here for. I will be the best and I will make my parents proud. Time is almost up I thin. I guess this has been good for me. Even though no one will probably ever read this I know it has been a vent. These are things no one has ever heard me say. So take car of it. Times up teach, talk to you later. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, since I don't know how to start, I'll start by talking about my weekend. I just about killed myself learning how to slalom ski. We started Saturday. Buck, Carl, Dylan, Kevin, Crystal, and I went to Lake Georgetown with my new boat. I made it my goal to learn how to slalom ski. I actually got up on one ski relatively quickly. The only problem is that it hurts when you fall. I broke my nose the first time that I fell because I kneed myself in the face. I spent the rest of the afternoon learning how to keep my balance and how to jump. The only problem with Saturday is that Crystal and Carl got into a fight. They've been dating for a couple of weeks now. Anyway, we went back to the lake Sunday and I kept trying different things and now I'm pretty good on one ski. And it is a blast, I'll never go back to two skis. Sunday night I played the role of mediator for everyone. I talked to Crystal about Carl and I talked to Carl about Crystal. They are trying to work things out, but it is going to be tough. Then I talked to Danielle about Buck. Danielle is one of Crystal's friends that started hanging out with us. She liked Buck a lot. Buck wasn't sure how he felt about her at first, but he's starting to like her. Right now they have bumped their relationship status to dating. This is good because they make a good couple and they make each other happy. At least as far as I can tell. But I did a lot of talking and more importantly listening Sunday. I think I helped smooth everything over with them for now. Carl and Crystal seem to be getting along better. I missed classes Monday because of injuries that I received over the weekend. I broke my nose, twisted my back and my left knee, and got a terrible case of whiplash. I couldn't even get out of bed Monday morning. I'm starting to recover though. I had to go to work Tuesday. I work at Internet Gateway in Georgetown. I love working there except that I don't get paid near what I should be getting. I make $9/hr. That should be 23 times more, but I only work 2 days a week anyway. I was working full time but I decided that since I have to go to school, I should make it my top priority. I didn't want to go to college, I'm not sure that I want to now that I'm going; but I know it is for the best and it makes my mom happy. That's really the only reason I'm going is because my mom wanted me to. Actually my whole family was pushing me to go. This is OK though because I know that they only want the best for me and a college education will help out tremendously later in life. Especially when I start looking for a better paying job. Although, college has been really fun so far. I have had my own house since this summer. Buck and I are roommates and we are renting a house in Georgetown. It is a lot of work, but it is worth it to say that I have my own place. Buck and I met at work. His dad owns the company where I am employed and he started working there during the spring. We have gotten to be best friends and we hang out all of the time. He is a good guy. We have a lot in common too. I've been lucky in that regard. I have a lot of good friends, and several that I can depend on for anything. It is a really good feeling to know that I can trust someone like Buck with my life. I've also been very lucky because my family is very close and we all can depend on each other. My stepfather bought me a truck for graduation last year. Robert, my stepfather, is a great guy and my mom and him make a very good couple. Well, I've put over my 20 minutes into this paper, and I have to go back to work now. "
Tell me about yourself.,"The walk was refreshing. I should do that more often. I am not sure why not many people take advantage of the beauty of nature and fresh air, and the flowers. My mother loves gardening. We always complain that she spends more time on the garden than on her children. It is just me, my brother and my Dad. Ours is a small family. Not like my neighbors. They have six children. Must be very noisy to live in that family. I like peace and quite when I watch TV or study. I do not think there are any good programs on tonight. I have never watched The West Wing or Will and Grace. Both won the Emmy. They are probably not my type. I just like Friends. This summer there were not any good movies also. Summer really ended so fast. I miss my friend, ""S"". I don't know what it would be like to be at Texas A&M with her. It is a shame she did not get admission at UT. I would have loved to share a room with her. My suite mate is OK. I had lunch with her but we do not have much in common. She is much younger and is in drama. I am in Natural Sciences. I am not sure how I decided on Pre Med. and maybe Business. For the longest time I wanted to be a teacher and my brother told me that it would not make me rich. Money is not everything. Well if I become a doctor, i. e. if I ever pass my MCAT. Why is life so difficult. I wish life was easier and we could do what we wanted. Better still I wish we did not have to grow up and worry about having a family or making money. I think it is getting warm. I need to turn on the AC. My room mate must be cold blooded. I need circulating air. It keeps me refreshed and relaxed. I am not sure why my parents moved to Texas from Canada. I love the snow and the cold. ""T"", my friend in Vancouver, has not replied to my email and she does not even like Instant messaging. I think it is neat that we can do that. I can make friends easily on the net, but face to face is really hard. Everyone thinks I am shy and they are probably true. I had no idea 20 minutes are so long and you can write so much. When I am doing something enjoyable time flies and now it seems that the clock does not move. I need to change this chair. It is so uncomfortable or maybe I can put a pillow on it. I think I will go for another walk after I am done with this. I wander if there is anything good on TV tonight. That fish I ate in the cafeteria is making me sick. I hate the food they serve. I am glad I am going home this weekend. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I really don't have a clue what to write about but I guess I'm supposed to think of what I'm feeling which is that my tank top's straps are really bugging me because they keep falling down and I keep looking at the pictures on my desk instead of the screen and what I am writing my refrigerator keeps making an annoying buzzing sound but I am concentrating on it anyway since I have to keep in touch with my senses. I keep staring at these pictures like I'm afraid to look at the screen or something it is a picture of me and my two friends from high school in our bathing suits acting like morons. there is also a lot of dust on my desk and on the picture frames and I really think I should clean them off, but I am pretty lazy so I doubt I will do that there is dust on everything around my computer!. the printer, the keyboard, the mouse pad, the phone and the pictures. my neck keeps itching; its probably from the dust or something. I can't believe I've only been typing for three minutes. this is going to be a very long paper, but this assignment is definitely a lot more fun than all the other ones in my other classes. uhoh the phone is ringing and I don't know whether to pick it up or not! I guess I can't because that would be breaking the rules! so I didn't and now it stopped and a really loud voice came on the answering machine of course the message wasn't for me I already had my really really good and nice phone calls for the day. I guess you could call me one of those losers that really misses home. I miss my boyfriend and my friends in the picture on my desk and my dad. and I miss my mom, but she's not at home, at least not technically because she's dead. this should be interesting to see where this thought leads because I have noticed in myself that whenever I think about my mom my brain won't let me and it starts thinking about something else like what I will wear tomorrow or something totally irrelevant. my mom was nice and I have a picture of her in my room but I can't really see it from where I am now because it's above my bed it makes me sad to think about her and when I do, like now, it makes me want to cry. I think that my brain realizes I will be too sad when I think about it so it won't let me. that is kind of nice of it, but sometimes when I just want to think about it, it won't let me. now my wrists are hurting from typing so fast for so long and my back is itching and it is getting very hot in here our room is always hot. my mom was always hot and we had to keep our house freezing cold nobody wanted to come to my house in the winter because it was so cold. it didn't matter this past winter, though, because she wasn't alive and I could turn the heat up if I wanted to because no one would yell at me for doing it. My dad would sometimes, but he doesn't really care. He'll yell at me to put on a sweater or something because I am costing him too much money when I can just put a sweater on but my dad is nice, not as nice as my mom, but he wasn't as understanding or shy as her. when she first died he was very understanding about everything but now he is the same as he always was there is a picture of us above my bed that I can see well it is of us dancing at my brother's wedding like ten years ago we were really happy then and we are now, too, I guess he just got married again so there was some tension there but its gone now for the most part, despite what he says. he is in Ireland now with his new wife because that is where she's from and her dad is dying so they went to see him. I liked her dad; he was a funny Irish guy he has cancer; it seems that everyone dies of cancer, although my mom didn't. my mom died because of an incompetent fire rescue ambulance squad and bad cop who will go to hell when he dies, hopefully. it bothers me that I am so bitter about him and the ambulance squad but I can't help thinking that my mom would still be alive if it weren't for them. now I only have five minutes left to go I am extremely itchy I am never this itchy in any other given twenty minutes, I guess its just the stress of actually having to think about my thoughts. the people outside are being so loud and annoying you think that if you were on the ninth floor you wouldn't hear stuff on the ground so far below, but you can. I keep going from staring at the pictures to staring at the screen; I'm afraid to look anywhere else I guess so now I am just sitting here listening to the people outside, enduring my itches, and thinking about how I've almost written a whole entire page on absolutely nothing relevant. I guess some parts were relevant because they made me pay attention to my surroundings and what my brain actually thinks I think it will be cool to go back and reread this. this was a fun assignment except my wrist really hurts now and my arms are sagging like how they tell you not to do on the anticarpel tunnel syndrome commercials and papers. but I only have one minute left now and I can't wait because my wrists are hurting and I don't think they can take much longer. I haven't typed in so long unless you consider email a valuable typing time which I don't because my emails are never a page and some long! ow. ow ow ow. those people are s "
Tell me about yourself.,"At this time in my life, my feelings have been tossed around in my mind. My stress level at the moment is much then I think that it has ever been. From what I have heard, the degree of difficulty in college is the highest possible. This worries me because I know that I am able of fulfilling my college experience, but the problem for me will be if I am able to apply myself. Application is an important aspect of college, and I really do not know if I will be able to focus as much as I should on my schoolwork. Another thing that has raised my stress level is women. With women, my mind has many feelings. One minute I will want to be with my old girlfriend, and the next I want to be with a new girl. My mind thinks about it consistently. Sometimes in class I find my mind drifting into places that it should not. This is when my brain realizes that I need to be focusing more on school in order to fulfill my dream. The stress in my life eventually comes to raise my anger level, at least that is the way I see it. When I get stressed out, I tend to want to release my anger by playing hockey. I feel that it helps me release my stress and my anger because it is something that will always be there for me, and my mind knows that it will be. Therefore, I tend to play better when I am angered because I become more aggressive. At least this is what I have noticed while playing. Feelings are a strange thing. The stuff above, I wrote about two days ago. Now it seems as if my whole perspective on life has changed. My mind has just switched due to a few events that have probably changed the whole outcome of my life. My mind used to hate all schoolwork what so ever, but now that I have grown physically and mentally, I actually enjoy reading and learning new information. I do not know why it intrigues me, but for some reason it does and I like it. I have recently discovered that I love math and I believe that it is what I would like to do with my life. I am considering strongly of changing majors from business to some field of mathematics. I believe that it would be really interesting to be able to be a professor for a math class or to do something else in life that involves complications in mathematics. The thing is, I am afraid to change my major, because I kind of think that I might regret. Getting into the business school is a hard thing to do at the University of Texas, and many people would consider it a stupid thing to get out of it. But from what I have seen so far in BA101 it does not seem as interesting to me as math. I like math so much because there is pretty much always a way to compute the answer to a problem. Knowing and understanding how and why the fundamentals work is the hardest and most time consuming part of math. But once one understands the fundamentals of math, they are capable of doing any form of math problem similar to the one that they understand. For many people, math is the enemy of all subjects. I personally do not like memorizing history or stupid biology stuff. I believe that is why I like math so much, because it is much easier for me to relate to. In a way, my body almost feels deprived because I have not played hockey in nearly 3 weeks. When I used to play at least 3 times a week. I feel like I am not exercising and that I am becoming unhealthy. This weekend, I will hopefully be able to satisfy this hunger for hockey when I go home. Hockey is most likely my favorite thing to do in life, I believe that it is because of the adrenaline rush and it helps relieve stress. Without it, I think my stress level is higher then normal because the stress is not relieved like it is used to being released. College should be an interesting experience. What is to come I do not really know yet, but I am sure that it will be a very interesting experience. Like my sister said, just make sure that you have as much fun as possible and make as good of grades as possible. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Today has been pretty easy. That girl in nursing got on my nerves, but at least I am out of there. For once, I actually do not have a headache yet. And it's already almost noon. I wish I didn't have to go to work today. It's not that I don't like working there, it just takes up so much time. Most of the people are nice. I wish I didn't have to stand up all the time, though. My back itches. It is really hot in my room. Lately, it has been freezing in here. It is probably because I am sitting right by the window. This assignment is really making me tired. However, I actually got almost 8 hours of sleep last night, which is practically a record for a school night. Maybe that is why I don't have a headache yet. Tonight, though, I need to go to the gym and work out. I have only worked out once since I've been here. I think I am getting out of shape, even though I seem to walk miles to my classes everyday. Oh well, it's not like I'm overweight or anything. I am probably losing weight since the cafeteria food is pretty bad sometimes. It used to make me sick for the first few days I was here. My neck itches now. I think it is moving! Oh my goodness I can't wait until this weekend. I finally get to go home and eat some normal food. Most of all, I get to see Chris. I miss him so much. I'm not really lonely all the time without him, but I am never really happy like I used to be. But after I see him for a few days and have to leave him again, I am sure I'll be pretty lonely. It makes me realize what is was like to be there with him all the time. Now my head itches. My back hurts. I haven't had a massage since I've been here. That would be so nice. Anyways, I just ate a nasty lunch and I feel kind of nauseous. Yuck. Dinner tonight is Mexican food and I think I'll walk to the union to eat. I am really tired now. This type of writing seems to put me into a trance. I feel like I need to take a nap now. I don't think that is possible though, since I have to be at work in about 45 minutes. At least that is the last thing I have to do today. I don't think I even have any homework. Maybe I'll take a nap after work. Well, actually, I need to call Chris after work. Maybe I'll take a nap after that. The room seems like it has cooled off a lot. Maybe the air conditioner finally kicked in. My neck and back are so stiff. I want to lay down so bad but I know that if I do, I'll probably fall asleep. My roommate slept in this morning. That was a good idea. I can't wait to see Chris. This weekend should be so much fun. I get all anxious hoping that everything goes well. I haven't seen my parents in 3 weeks. I know my mom is just dying to see me and my brother. I need to email her. I need to email Chris too. I wonder what Brian is up to. Maybe I should call him. I don't think I will because he is probably in class and I really don't want to talk to his roommate. Speaking of roommates, I need to talk to my ra. about the roommate contract she emailed us about. I have no idea what she is talking about. Oh well. My twenty minutes in finally over. I think I will go lay down. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm watching my breath. Listening to it enter and exit my body. It is quiet. There is a bit of tension in my sinuses and my jaw is slightly tightened as well. my mind is quiet. Now I am back in pennebaker's class on Wednesday. I'm sitting in this incredibly crowded room with over five hundred students in it. Someone is sitting on the floor. Pennebaker has a microphone! The feelings of being back at school again. It is nice for this to be semester number two at UT. It's easier to get around. But still a shock to be back on campus with fifty thousand other humans after spending a month hiking in the mountains on the other side of the world. All of the traffic: cars, bikes, pedestrians, are such a foreign scene after the solitude of the mountains. Although this scene is not so different from the crowded streets of Delhi, India. My memories of the mountains in nepal continue to surface. Different parts of the trip. I remember so much so vividly. The day that ramesh and I left kag beni for jomsom and walked along the river. It was wide and roaring. The wind blew hard. At times the river bed was so wide that we could walk along the dry part of it. I hummed ""Dust in the Wind"" by Kansas feeling the immensity of this land and the tiny insignificance of my small person as I walked through it. A little bit frightening, a little bit mystifying, a little bit liberating. Now we're in Jomsom, waiting for a plane that will come and leave again without taking us back to Pokhara. We are sitting with a bunch of old Nepali men who are chatting about the dangers of the planeor so I figured, they spoke only in Nepali. I feel an odd bond with these old men that I cannot understand. They are part of me. There's a monk waiting for the plane as well and when it comes, takes some passengers and leaves us behind, he, along with ramesh and I decide to walk back to Pokhara. The stress of traveling in a foreign country that has a different perception of time is difficult to adjust to. Ramesh and I are driving on his motorbike toward Kathmandu from Pokhara. Monsoon rains have caused landslides along the road and we cannot pass. There are many people waiting to pass, including many distraught westerners. The urge to become stressed out is very strong, but I have to smile. What am I worried about? Things will work out. Now I am home, back to the fast paced society where I have spent most of my life. In the airport in Detroit, the first thing I notice is how fastpaced everything is. People all seem to be in a hurry. I practice Buddhist meditation and this helps me to focus my mind and not run off with all of the stresses and worries that are present each day. But what makes us live in this way? We move so fast that often we are not able to enjoy the life that is right in front of us. I return to the mountains. Now I am on Poon Hill. The first morning that I have seen the Annapurnas. It's really early and the sun is rising over the mountains. We're sitting on a picnic table that looks out on an immense valley that meets the grand peaks. I can sit here all day. I feel so open and expansive. Now we're in Tatopani. Ramesh, Dhundup and I are staying at a lodge right next to the hot springs which we enjoyed earlier. Now it's dinnertime and we're sitting on the patio, drinking hot tea and cold Fanta. Ramesh and I are playing chess. I don't know how to play, but am excited about surrendering my fear and trying something new. As I walked up to the table, Ramesh's smile lit up his entire face and my entire insides. As we play chess, we continue to exchange looks that are full of energy. Three weeks later, when I finally depart Pokhara, I blow him a kiss as I get on the plane. So many incredible new experiences that have molded and shaped my life in amazing new ways. When thinking about this trip, I feel open and expansive in a new way. I feel incredibly happy. I deserve to feel happy after the struggles of the spring of this year. Oh, and my time was up. Until next time! "
Tell me about yourself.,"As I gaze at the screen I sit and wonder what is the meaning of friendship. This is my main thought at the moment. I've had rough relationships with friends. To me friends are the kindness that everyone needs. They are around when nothing seems right. They continually partake in your days' events. Friends give comfort that no other can give. No matter what the circumstances may be, a friend will always be there for you. Therefore a friend is always ready to lend a ""helping hand"". I guess friendship is a bond between two souls. A friendship is a promise to be ""there"" whenever possible and an understanding of one's feelings. A friend is the one who will help and support you in the pursuit of your dreams and who will only give to your thoughts. In a sense a friend is your shadow only with a mind and a heart. The greater is the heart. For a friend consoles us when in joy or agony. Anything that causes grief or hurt affects our friend. A friend has no materialistic need and can only be repaid with the same truth that is given to you. Friendship is a privilege and a great responsibility. As I write about friendship I think of my friends. One friend comes to mind. She is such a wonderful person. I love her because she accepts me for the way I am. For half my life I've learned to be scared but with her I know that it's okay to open up. So many things run through my mind that I don't even understand them. Thoughts of hate and confusion run about my mind all the time. It sometimes seems as if time just passes by and I can't stop to take a breath. People around me seem to talk but nothing is seen or heard from me. Sometimes I feel like all I do is live in other people's shadows. I feel that I wake up and I am really nobody. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Ok, so I'm sitting here wondering what I'm going to eat for dinner, even though I'm not hungry. My roommate just told me what there is at jester and she also told me that she waited to do her homework until I woke up because she didn't want the printer to wake me up. She is so sweet. She has selfesteem issues that she takes medication for and for the life of me I can't understand people like this. It's like I want to just tell them to snap out of it. It's very frustrating for me because I don't understand it. She and I talked about this issue last night before we went to sleep. I told her how I felt and we've come to an understanding. I'm starting to miss my parents. I feel very sad for my mother because I know she misses me a lot. I don't tell my mother often enough how much I love and respect her I should do this. I stood in line for an hour today for football tickets for the OU game in Dallas. I love it here but it will be nice to return to a place I am so familiar with. I hope Liz forgets about her exboyfriend Aaron. She is so cool. I am really glad we met one another. He is such a weirdo and she is so smart and independent and ambitious. I don't see how she does it. I mean, she's doing the Kvr TV station thing and Comm council and an internship at the capitol, and 14 hrs. and she just has to obtain a 4. 0 or she'll just die. Me on the other hand, I'm just trying to make it here. I'm used to doing it all. I handled everything going on in High School, but that was dealing with 300 people and easy classes that I swore were hard. I just really hope I make the novice rowing team here. I've put so much time and energy in preparation for tryouts. I work out everyday and go out of my way to get noticed. Liz just called about us going to get our meningitis shots tomorrow. I also need to get my chicken pox vaccination because I've never had them and I don't want to get them now, because I'm afraid I'll like die or something. My mother should have exposed me to them when I was a child. I just saw Julie and she wasn't very nice. I hope she's not mad at me. I have to go to the boathouse and run a lot tomorrow and I'm sitting here dreading it. But, if I make the team it will all be worth it. My roommate snores really loud at night. I plug my ears with cotton. It angers me. It's very difficult to sleep. I have so many things to do. I feel like there aren't enough hours in the day to do what I need to get done. Austin is really hot. I hope Eddie and Lydia work things out. He loves her so much and I really want them to be together. I'm thinking about the OU game again. I am so excited to see him and my other cousin. They are big UT fans. They are so happy that I am going here. I almost feel bad, because I guess I didn't really consider it that big of a deal that I got in. Everywhere I go, people look at me in awe when I tell them I go to school here. Well, I'm going to stop writing now. It's been 20 minutes and all I can think about is all the stuff I have to do now. I have Journalism, Rhetoric and Geography homework so I'm going to get started. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Ok, I've just turned off the news so the thing that I have on my mind right now is the up and coming election. I really can't stand Gore, he is so robotic, I don't understand how anyone can stomach looking at him or listening to him. Now I am debating whether or not to get up and turn off the television or if I should just sit here and listen to the noise annoy me. Well I have decided to turn it off, ok that's much better, now I can write a more accurate account of what I am thinking. I really don't know what to write, I have never done anything like this before. My computer is really getting on my nerves because it isn't fast enough to keep up with my typing, and I can't stand all the little red squiggly lines that show what all I have misspelled thus far. I don't like not being able to fix it, and now the phone is ringing and that really bothers me because it breaks my concentration even more. Well it turned out to be a wrong number, someone looking for Heidi, I know this because my roommate had to answer on speaker phone, now it is ringing again and it was that girl that had the wrong number, this time she just hung up. What a moron, I mean really how much guts does it really take to fess up and say that you were dumb enough to dial the same wrong number twice? Not saying that I haven't done it before because I most definitely have but I also told the person I was sorry for interrupting them twice. My computer is really getting on my last nerve. I feel like asking my dad to buy me another one. Now that I have said that it reminds me about how everyone always says what a spoiled brat I am for getting everything that I want. I don't think its my fault that my dad loves me so much. I think that my brothers do though. Speaking of brothers, I rode out with my brother Eric yesterday and that was really fun. I think that if I wasn't so caught up in money and status I would become a paramedic instead of a doctor. Oh well maybe I'll become an ER doctor. That would be pretty cool. I just watched ER tonight and it was pretty good. Mark Green reminds me of Eric's friend Jim, he's really nice but he is married to a psycho just like Eric is. I used to want to be a psychiatrist but after last night I defiantly don't want to do that. We ran a call on a girl that over dosed on her anxiety medication. All she did was whine about how no one loved her and all of her friends had boyfriends, just like Sunni. Sometimes I wish that I could be a writer like JD Salinger. He is really awesome. I know that this sounds really morbid but I almost can't wait for him to die so that we can read more of his work. And if that sounded bad another person that could keel over at any given moment is ""Deep throat,"" from the Nixon scandal, I would really like to know who that is. I really don't want these people to die, I mean I wouldn't wish that on anyone, I just would like to find out some more things. Oh well I have about two more minutes and I can stop writing this. I'm glad that no one is going to read it because that would be really embarrassing. I can't believe how much stuff I am misspelling. It's like I never attended first grade. Well I did fail spelling in the fifth grade but doesn't that make me a genius? "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, lets see, I'm writing for about thirty minutes here in my dorm room and well, I'm actually not sure what to write about. I guess since you are going to read this a little I should just tell you about myself. My name is Robert Barajas and I am a freshman here at UT. I am originally from El Paso, Texas, but I am rather familiar with the city of Austin already because my brother has been coming here for the past four years. I am in the Longhorn Marching Band and I play the TUBA! Besides your class I'm taking astronomy, philosophy, and a freshman seminar. What I really like about the University is that I get to meet all sorts of people. I've even made a new friend here in your own class. Her name is Amanda and I think she might become one of my friends by the time the year is over. But I've learned over the years that whether it happens or not is not the most important thing. Life will go on either way, whether we're friends, whether I pass your class, or even whether I decide to just sit at home and do nothing. That's the beauty of life. But it could also been since as the travesty of it as well. I consider myself to be a rather enlightened individual and so I have a rather morphed way of seeing things. I am my own island of tranquility in this sea of chaos. But chaos can be beautiful as well. Umm, its only been like six minutes so far so I don't know what else to write. I guess I could just type the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over again, just to improve my typing skills. Improvement is always a good thing. I believe that people are too preoccupied with the accumulation of material things. And that the only way to deal with this would be to take away all material things. Like people are not humble and they should be. I'm still in the process of finding ways to implement this idea, but most of these are still on the drawing board. Like if someone created free energy and just gave it out to everyone, I belief that that might completely destroy the economy and that would be good. Money serves no purpose but to bind us to our material things. Or, on a more serious note, what I think the people of the world need is some lifealtering event. Perhaps WWIII would suffice. That way everything and everyone would be dead and the few survivors would have to band together and realize that there is more to life than what we have now. There should be no prejudice or racism. Only on what people think should people be criticized, not on what they look like. That it shouldn't matter on their appearance but on the quality of their thoughts. Even that sounds a bit wrong to people but its just because most don't envision the same thing as me. Oh, well, whatever. These are just some random thoughts that I'm having. Take care and God bless. Bye. "
Tell me about yourself.,"trying to track how my mind works. I have so many different things going on in my head right now. mainly worries. I have so much to do and it seems like so little time. the scholarship, the basta website, the volunteer tutoring thing. I don't know if I'll be able to finish everything. I feel so drained, so tired. oh well. nothing is as it seems. blah, I feel like I need to just stand in a field and scream at the top of my lungs and let all this worry all this frustration everything that is inside me just come out. maybe then I can relax. I worry too much occupy my mind with so many different things I sometimes feel like my head is going to explode. ay diosito santo que vida. yawn. I feel like I need a vacation. a six month vacation away from everything. no classes, no relationship problems. or I should say breakup. I know that this is part of the problem. I've spent three years with adrian and now from one day to the next he wants things to be over. because he's not sure how he feels. we survived a year in a long distance relationship and now nothing. oh well. not much you can do. I feel sad. lonely overwhelmed at times. but I have good days. days when I feel like I could go on forever just plowing through the week the months the year until I finish my program. then what after that. I feel like I don't have a direction. I have a ba, worked as a teacher in ny for a year, now back in school to finish a certificate program. but then what I want to go to grad school, to law school maybe, but when. what if I don't make it then what. I have no plan. I feel like I just am trying to figure out what I need or want to do. who am I really. what am I going to do. I need a good day of just sleep. that would be really nice right about now. a day of sleep, of rest with no interruptions, no worries just sleeping. I don't even want to dream. just that kind of dead to the world thing. no time though. too much to do too many things going on. deadlines and commitments and work and school and everything in between. gosh I've been rambling, but not saying much really. stream of consciousness assignment. seems forced. are these really my true thoughts or thoughts only in response to an assignment. I think I'm thinking too much. what time is it anyway. time to stop maybe. twenty minutes translates to a good number of thoughts huh. time to go, I've got errands to run. what time is it anyway. good only about thirty seconds left. "
Tell me about yourself.,"It may be tough to come up with an abundance of ideas this morning, because I am fairly tired due to lack of sleep. Even though my first class today is not until two o'clock, I woke up early, not a brilliant decision on my part, and I am regretting it as we speak. However, I assume that I will feel alright once I venture outside into the sun and the sweltering heat that has overwhelmed Austin for the past several months. I hope the twenty minutes that I am required to write for pass by in a hurry, because I have yet to finish some of my Economics homework that is due in class today. I have yet to discern whether my Economics professor is adequate in his teachings. On several occasions, he has veered off the lecture topic and has attempted to entertain the class with anecdotes and personal experiences that possess no ties to the world of economics. On the other hand, my Calculus II teacher is not my favorite, because he moves very quickly through sections of the book and speaks very poor English. I am not quite sure where exactly he is from but his accent makes it difficult to understand his lectures. Aside from these two exceptions, my professors appear after two weeks to be very adept in their teaching methods and are very entertaining and informative to listen to. I am tired of talking about school, because it seems like that is the only thing I came to Austin for. On many occasions so far I have gone out on nights that I wouldn't normally party on and have had a blast on good old Sixth Street. I think it helps a lot that a bunch of my friends from high school decided on the University of Texas as their college of choice, because it has given me people to hang out with until I am able to meet and feel comfortable with a new group of friends. I have yet to pick out a girl worth going after, even though there are thousands of gorgeous and available women, because I have yet to give up my feelings for an old friend of mine from high school who decided to pursue a tennis scholarship at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, much to my dismay. I frequently talk to her via email and telephone, but we both feel that a long distance relationship would not be the best thing for us at the moment. However, I find it hard to stop thinking about her, because she is exactly what every guy desires in a woman. She is blonde, just shorter than me, has a perfect figure, is very athletic, intelligent, and her father has a lot of money, which is always a plus. The only downfall which she possesses is that she can be clumsy at times. In fact, yesterday she spilled silver nitrate down her shirt in Chemistry Lab, thus causing her to have to us the emergency shower in the back room. To make a long story short, the chemical turned her skin purple and it doesn't wash off for at least two weeks. I am currently living at University Towers with three roommates from my high school, one of which is a pain in the ass. He has taken it upon himself to become a fatherly figure or one who scolds us for doing stuff that he doesn't approve of. It has become a nuisance. Anyway, as my nineteenth minute comes to a close I must wrap it up so as not to exceed the guidelines of the assignment. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I have to go to the SI unit and then the Crew meeting and come home, shower, get ready, and meet Ann and Chad for dinner. I should have some time tonight to do homework. I'm still tired from last night, maybe I can take a nap sometime today. Otherwise, I can always sleep in tomorrow. Having only afternoon classes will be interesting. My lab might be hard because it's at night, but it seems really lax. It's such a difference from the chem labs. I'm so glad it doesn't seem hard at all. I hope my physics lab is easy as well. One can only hope. Not having lab the first week is nice. It worked out well so I could be home to help my parents help move our stuff. It's such a pain to have to move when school is already in session. I'm a little shocked the manager didn't have us sign the lease before we moved in. I hope that's not an indication of how much she cares about the renters. At least there's a lady downstairs who has lived here for 20 years that knows everything about this place. It's so nice having an apartment right next to a bus stop. I think it's fate we moved in here. After all the hassles we've had it looks like its going to be worth it. I still have to hang up all my clothes, but everything else is done. I can't forget to meet Dan at 10am on Monday in the PCL to work on physics homework. It's 6 pages long. I hope it's as easy as the first homework. It still took a while to finish though. From 7pm to 1am. This time I'll start earlier. I'm glad that my sister is coming in town, but she picked a bad weekend. I have a lot of reading to do and 2 tests to study for. I need to start seriously studying the PCAT. I can't believe I almost missed the deadline on that again. This is ridiculous. I hope I get into UT Austin. That's the only place I'd really like to go. Except maybe UCSF or University of Washington. UCSF is probably too expensive. I'd want to live in San Fran when I have money so really I only want to got o Pharmacy school in Austin or Seattle. The only thing about Seattle is I hope Sylvia has gotten cleaner. I know she never cooks anymore, so probably. We'd have to get a bigger place than what she has now and I might just have to leave all my stuff here and buy new stuff. That's going to be expensive. I hope whatever happens, Mom and Dad aren't disappointed in me. They need a web page for PAC so I know when I need to get in line and for what. The draw system for the football team is so much more efficient, even though they don't give out all the information I need either. Maybe next year I won't buy either. It's so much of a pain. I don't even feel like going. I bet that's how they make their money. I don't know about the plays, but at the games students get crappy seats. I know they were trying to improve that, I wonder if that went through. Probably not. As a whole, UT just cares about money and not the poor students. That's why alumni get everything. Good luck to the ""sick"" staff. "
Tell me about yourself.,"As I sit in this room, in this computer lab, I hear all the different sounds around me. The computer is humming and somebody is opening a pack of some type of food. I also can't help but notice that this keyboard clicks loudly as I type. I've never tracked my thoughts before and this is actually kind of fun. My eyes are feeling very small because more than anything, I would love to take a nap. This day was pretty long. I hope this weekend is extra long and productive for me. I'm feeling so tired! I would love to just get up under my comforter and stuff my three pillows in the corner and chill out. I don't believe how small my eyes are feeling right now. I know when I go back to my dorm room though my room mate is going to beg me to go to dinner with her but I ate way too much today and I am not in the least bit hungry. Not to mention that the food smells kind of nasty. I wish I was home at these moments to eat some real food, but it's nice to be away from home also. I hope that my boyfriend will come and visit me this weekend. It would be great to see him again though it really hurts when he leaves. Seeing him makes me miss him more but I guess I should enjoy our time together. I wish he went to this school or at least lived in Austin then we wouldn't have this long distance problem. He seems to think it is ok and the distance factor is not of any importance to him. I don't believe him when he says that. I wonder if he is as committed as he says he is. I am pretty sure he is especially after all that we have been through. I hope we can make it for the next few years but who knows what will happen? I wonder what will happen with us since long distance relationships are not supposed to last long. I think I'd be the one to influence that stereotype the most because I'm the one in a college setting and he's in the same environment in which we established ourselves. I do love him though. It'd be nice to be in my room talking to him and laying on my bed. dosing off and falling asleep. Tonight is Thursday night. This is a good night because I have no obligations to do any homework for this night other than this. I should have done this assignment earlier but of course I always wait for the last minute. But technically this isn't the last minute because its not Friday yet, and it is early evening. Tonight I want to do nothing but relax! I hope I can get together with my friends since I don't see much of them anymore. I wish I lived at Jester at times like this. I thought it would be cold in the computer lab but today it is actually warm. I have this sweatshirt on but I don't feel like taking it off. How many more minutes until my time is up? I've typed quite a bit of information thus far. Pretty interesting how much stuff runs through my head. I wonder if this is more than most people or maybe its that I type fast and I can type basically every thing that I am thinking. This computer is pretty cool and the icons are cute. I hear music and I'm wondering where it is coming from. I figure since tonight is the Mexican culture night they are playing some kind of ranchero music. They should have a Honduran culture night. Haha. Why is the computer across from me making so much noise? Wow. I sure do ask my self a lot of questions. Well, I think my time is almost up. I guess I have about. its taking me a while to figure this out. I am so terrible at mental math. What happened? I have 5 minutes left I guess. How terrible I am at mental math! I am glad that I don't have to worry about turning in calculus homework tomorrow. My grade for today's homework assignment is going to suck because my teacher does a horrible job of explaining anything and I've been too lazy to go to the office hours. But I did go to the math lab, which was not in service to the calculus students. Why do we have more restricted hours for calculus. I walked all that way to Jester for nothing. I'm sure if I got the proper instruction yesterday afternoon my calculus homework grade would be a lot better than its going to be. Why am I assuming that I will get a bad grade? Maybe I won't. The TA seems pretty easy going and she knows that I am interested in keeping/getting a good grade for that class. I. am glad the movie station is back on. I'd like to be under the covers watching a movie right about now. Sleep. I want to sleep! I wish I wasn't always so tired. Yes! I only have a few more minutes left. I'd say about 2 minutes left. Finally! This is already a one and a half page singlespaced paper in Times new roman font. I didn't know I had that much stuff running through my head. Actually, it doesn't surprise me. I always have too much stuff running through this head of mine and then they all get jumbled up and I can't think straight. I think that's why I interrupt people so much when I'm talking. because I have so much stuff in my mind that if I don't say it I'll forget it. I guess that shouldn't matter since I'll have another 10 million thoughts to compensate for that one loss. But anyways. My time is up. How great! "
Tell me about yourself.,"I cannot believe that I have only been back home for a couple of days and already I want to go back to UT. I guess in a weird way I consider UT my home now. It is part of my normal routine and coming home just messes with that normality in my life. I am happy to see everyone, but it just is not the same. I see things differently now than I used to and am starting to wonder if I even want what I used to. I want to go into journalism, but ever since I got to UT everyone talks of how a person should find that one thing they are passionate about. I am passionate about journalism, and it makes me happy, but what if there is something else out there that I would love even more? I am only eighteen, I could not possible know right now what I want to do with the rest of my life. I have a good idea, but I cannot know for sure. Yet everyone expects me to know what I want. I do not know why everyone is in such a hurry to finish college and have a career. Personally, I just love the process of learning interesting things. I have been waiting forever to go to college just so I could have the opportunity to learn about the literature that they do not teach in high school. Every thing that we are told in high school is so limited and lacking in truth because teachers do not want to be fired for actually having an opinion on something. In my high school, nobody was allowed to think for themselves. It was a typical high school. Academics were mediocre, but football was God. The athletes were looked upon as these heroes who meant so much to the world, when it other students who went on to some of the best colleges around. Athletes fall apart with time, but that is what no one seemed to want to admit. Some people thought all the jocks who went and got drunk on weekends were the coolest people around, but they weren't. In a few years they are just going to look back upon high school as their glory years, when there could be so much ahead of them. I do not really think I learned much in high school. I learned more in three weeks in Europe than I did in high school by just experiencing other people's lives. I had all these romantics notions of Italy and France, but really they are just other places where other people are just trying to make it in the world. I really want to go back there sometime. Germany was so gorgeous, and I thought I would hate it. In the end, it was one of the best places we visited. Most people do not have the opportunity to go there, but I think it prepared me a lot for college. I had to interact with a lot of people that I did not know really well. I also had to sleep on hard twin beds that remarkable remind of the ones in the Jester Dorms. Who would have thought that beds that bad would be an international thing?! It is kind of weird being in a dorm. Instead of having to drive to see my friends, I could just take the elevator to a different floor and see them. We are practically living together. I just hope we do not end up getting really irritated with one another. It just seems that if we spend too much time together things go wrong. We either start to get annoyed with one another and start doing the whole backstabbing thing or the group chemistry is just off. Unfortunately, it can be really easy to do that too and that is when people start to think that they hate each other. Two of my good friends are coming to school here. It really is a good thing too because I am kind of shy at it would be hard for me to meet people otherwise. I can talk and talk once you get me going, but I'm not really good at those first meetings. Things always seem too awkward to me. Then I just feel uncomfortable. I think that is why I usually just surround myself with a few really good friends. It is just easier to deal with people who know you really well than those who will base their thoughts on you from one impression. In time though, I should be able to relax and deal with all these things. I hope, anyway. "
Tell me about yourself.,"There is this really annoying beep that will not stop, and at the moment it is the center of my attention, my focus. I cannot think of anything else because now that I have acknowledged this repetitive sound I cannot get it out of my head. It seems as though it is getting louder. I also hear the flopping of someone's shoes as they get closer, oh, and another person. Each of them into their own schedule, their own life. Wow, shoes all have such a distinct sound. Someone just walked by with shoes that have a very hard sole and make a loud rough sound. The beeping continues. A girl nearby is getting a drink from a machine. I bet she's thirsty. I'm thirsty actually. I'm hungry, too. Someone else just walked in the nearby door and a bell just rang. I hear some more clank of change and that sound of a drink coming down the machine to yet another thirsty person. As he came around the corner he was the same guy who just walked in the door but just left out the same door. I wonder where he is going, if he's a student. What kind of life he has, his interests everything that makes him an individual. More squeaky shoes. I seem to be hearing all of the shoe noises possible, as well as that beeping that still lingers in my ear. Everyone has different ears. People are so different. I love UT because there are so many unique people, and a lot of them are very friendly. Something just changed in the overall sound the air conditioner went off or some other constant light sound ceased, for it now seems much more quiet. I hear a man's voice in the nearby classroom who is talking about parabolas. Oh, how I don't like math. It's like a different language to me, and it scares me to think of some of the classes I might take. The ringing continues. A man walked by talking to himself. I wonder if he realized he was talking to himself, or if it's just one of those things that people do naturally and then when you ask them about it they can't believe they do whatever that thing is. The ring seems longer as it still persists the intervals between them are about 5 seconds. It's thundering. It's sprinkling outside but it's sunny I'm waiting for it to stop so I can walk back to my dorm. I could just walk now but I am content just sitting here. The chair is comfortable. It's almost like a couch, and the cushioned back feels nice. Now the coke machine in front of me started making that same noise again which stopped few minutes ago, aahh. I still hear the ringing. What is that? And the man's voice in the classroom. I can't make out what he's saying because of the other little noises. More people around the corner. My finger kind of hurts from writing so fast without stopping. I wonder how many muscles are working right now in my hand allowing me to write? Again, another girl's shoes flop against the floor. The floor is orange tile and not a bright orange kind of burnt, how ironic? Another guy walks by I wonder, too, where he is going. Is he married? More clanking of change and ringing, but there is now nobody in the hall. Chalk writing on the board it's an interesting sound. I'm thirsty. I'd like an orange juice. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now I feel somewhat tired and weak because of work last night. I'm also feeling a little upset because the Eagles destroyed the cowboys 4114 to. And to top it off we lost Joey Galloway, our best receiver. Also Troy Aikman had another concussion and who knows what will happen next. But on a more serious note I'm a little worried about college. I guess I feel like I have a lot of weight on my shoulders, because I want to prove to my family and to myself that I can make it. School has always come pretty easy to me, but this is college and it worries me. I think once I get the first test out of the way I will be fine. At least I hope I will be fine! I'm also having mixed feelings because I quit my job in order to have ample time for college. Things just weren't mixing right so I had I discussed it with my family we decided it was best for me to hold out on working until I got in the grind of college. Life has been pretty good lately it's hard to get a schedule with so many things going on. Each day is a whole new adventure. Some troubles I ran into with college so far were finding a parking place and having to walk ten minutes to my classes. One good thing that has happened though is I have really good classes and professors. I also have people looking out for me and I have made some new friends. UT is like a whole new country there are so many people, places, and things to do. I'm beginning to understand college life. When I first applied to UT I had no idea that it would be like this. I never expected it to be so big and beautiful. Everywhere you walk there is something new to see. Every building is huge and has something that sets it apart from the others. I guess UT is blown out of proportion with me because I come from a small town of 5000 people. It was a city where the most popular people won everything. But here at UT it doesn't matter who you are. It's like everybody starts over. Everybody is giving a clean slate. It's a great chance to prove myself to the people around me, my family, and me. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Okay, 20 minutes. Hope I can turn this in on time! Blasted software! Need to get my car washed badly. Did so much driving this weekend. It's a good thing it rained though.

Tell me about yourself.,"It's crazy to think here I am in a different city, a new room with new things everywhere. I am now a college student. During high school I couldn't wait for it and now that I'm here I feel out of place. Sure, I know plenty of people from high school along with a list of people whose names I no longer remember, and I stay busy doing all sorts of things, but it is not what I expected. The classes are so big, but is that not what you hear about every school, especially UT. I have not had the success I had I hoped to in meeting people, being the sociable person that I am, I expected it to come easier. I tell myself to give it more time, develop a routine, and things will get better. Everyone says get involved and you will meet more people. It makes me wonder if I should have rushed, though I do not see myself as a sorority girl. It seems as though everyone who pledged a sorority or fraternity is having such a great time. Are they really paying for friendships? I do not think I would have fit in to such a place. I just hope that by going to church groups and other small organizations that I will meet some people with whom I really enjoy hanging with. I am looking forward to my freshmen seminar that begins next Monday. With 30 people in the class, I know I will get to know some of the other students. I never thought I would admit to being homesick, but it is true. Though no one wants to admit it, we all miss home a little bit. However, when we are there we tend to hate it. Isn't it funny how that works? I have also decided that Austin is a city full of beautiful people. Everywhere I look, goodlooking boys and girls. It definitely has both disadvantages and advantages. I enjoy looking at the guys, yet there is so much competition at parties. Should I really care all that much what people at a frat party think of me? Well, I do and it definitely does not do much for one's selfesteem. I believe I am finding competition in everything. Whether it's who was at the gym longer, who studied the most, who had a better meal at dinner, who drank the most last night, or who's going to more parties, there is a definite sense of competition in everything between the people I know. The people I went to high school with. The people whom I now want to separate myself from. Another thing I have noticed is how sleepy I always am. Here I am at 12:22 writing this when I am insanely tired. But why go to sleep, when I do not have a class until 2 tomorrow. There are also a lot of sick people around. The allergies are much worse here than almost anywhere I have been. I have had a cough and a cold since I've been here. It seems like I have so many problems, but I know that there are many people who would die to be in shoes. That is a good feeling, to be in a place where others want to be. I know I need to give things time and make the best of what I have. "
Tell me about yourself.,"My throat hurts. I had a little too much troubling trying to spell throat. I've now discovered hat my brain works much faster than I can type. I hope I'm not getting sick. All I can think about is this assignment. Now I'm thinking about all the things I need to do today. And this weekend, I have to write a rough draft of a paper. I need to go to the library or something. It's really cold in here. My eye itches. I hope they found the people that were smoking in the building last night. That's probably why my throat hurts today. We could smell it through the vents. I need to go to the store. Now my nose itches. Our room looks kind of messy. Can I listen to music while doing this assignment? They'll never know. I have to watch the clock and stop at 10:47. I remember when I heard this song for the first time. I hope it rains today. I don't like Star Jones. She seems really mean and pushy. All I can think about is what should I think about next so I can type it. I need to email my mom after this. I'm trying not to, but I can't help but sensor this. She needs a different haircut. She would look better. Ouch. That hurt my sunburn. I have 8 minutes to go. Oh I really like this part of the song. I love jazz. I think I need to buy some cough drops. I'll out that on my list of things to get at the store. I really like this part of the song too. I need to get my math homework done early. Why did it repeat, I didn't tell it to repeat. Or maybe I did. What was that? I think it was talking chickens. When you turn the sound down, not all commercials are as selfexplanatory as you might think. I needed to know that. I want to go somewhere. I need to drive. I just don't know how to get anywhere. I'm just killing time until the 20 minutes are up. Oh laundry tips, I've got to watch. And look at that, times up. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am a freshman at UT but it is not a new experience for me. My older brother and sister both went here and my brother is still here to help me out which is awesome for me. I see so many confused freshman everyday even though it's already the 3rd week of school and they should know where they're going but they don't. I'm just really glad that it's not me. I am really independent however so this would be a fun experience, not scary, even if I was all alone. I like to look at things as being an adventure instead of a danger. I do go home every other weekend though because my boyfriend, who happens to be my brother's best friend, goes to the Art Institute of Dallas. Dallas is where I am from although it has changed a lot since I first moved there. I can't wait until this Thursday when I can go home to see Greg, my boyfriend again. I have been in serious relationships before but never have I been so much in love. Ever since we starting dating both of us just knew that we were going to be together for the rest of our lives. I can't wait to get done with school, start my job as an elementary school teacher, and be married to the love of my life. As corny and ""Leave it to Beaver"" as that may sound, that is really what I want to do. My real life goal was always just to be a Mom and nothing else. I didn't want a ""real job"" as they're called even though being a housewife is much harder than many highranking jobs out there. But, my dad said that I was too smart to do that and that if one day I just happened to be on my own I needed a good education so that I could have a good job to support myself or my kids with. It actually never occurred to me that I wouldn't go to college until he said that. I wanted to go to college for 4 years, but I guess I was just thinking that I wouldn't have a major but still graduate somehow. I was young then and didn't quite know how this whole college thing worked yet. But, anyhow, here I am and I'm loving it. It is such a refreshing changed from high school where you feel like you are going to a prison every day where they freeze you to death and make you tired as hell. But there was really no possible way to fall asleep because it was always way too cold to relax. So it really was like torture in that it was as if they were filling you full of some sleeping agent but holding your eyelids open for 8 hours. Enough about that though, bad memories. I am here now not knowing quite what to expect. I took summer classes at a really, really easy junior college this summer and have enough credits to be a sophomore when spring semester starts. The faster I get out, the better. But I know that UT is nothing like a junior college in any way. And I also know that no matter how easy a class seems during lecture, the tests are always hard and are nothing to take lightly. Which is good because if this school was easy, I wouldn't learn anything that I would remember longer than the test. But, it also puts a hamper on some of those freshman who expect it to be like high school. They go out on weeknights and party and don't get home until the next morning and then get up for class 3 hours later. And maybe they could pull that in high school and get away with it, or maybe they never did that in high school and are just experimenting with their new found freedom. Either way, they are going to get a big slap in the face when their first test rolls around. But that is their problem and not mine, although life would be much kinder to them if they would have learned that during high school. "
Tell me about yourself.,"At this present, I am feeling a lot of stress. I don't know why. There is so much going through my head right now, that I sometimes get confused. Maybe I'm just worrying about my grades and how my four years will come along at UT. I am concentrating at this screen, but feel kind of dazed and a little lonely. Come on now, hurry up and get through this. I am very strict on myself when it comes to following through with things. A few days ago, I took a quiz in my Bio 211 class. I don't think I did very well on it, and it's still nagging on me like an itch on my back that I can't reach. I have very high expectations of myself. I guess that's because of the way I was brought up, and the way I handled myself through my other years of schooling. In my high school, I was second in my class. I was that type of person who always had to get straight A's. Making a B was absolutely unacceptable in my mind. This had nothing to do with my mom. She really doesn't care what I get. I and only I brought on this extreme pressure that I put on myself. I guess if you're in a habit of always making good grades, it's a habit that's very hard to break. That is how I come to terms with my behavior and attitude towards work. I hate feeling awkward. I am very selfconscious. I don't know if it has to do with me being very shy, or what, but I get nervous easily. Sometimes I feel everyone is looking at me waiting for me to make a mistake. This happens to me wherever I go. Well, I'm getting a little tired and my head is starting to hurt. Maybe it's because I've been staring at this screen already for about ten minutes straight. I don't know. About my opinions about UT: I think it's a good school. The only complaint I have is the heat. It is very hot here. I don't remember it being this hot in Houston. I always wonder when the next cool day will come. When I first came here, I felt pretty homesick. Everything was new to me, and when I thought of the new responsibilities that I would have to grasp during the next four years, that really made me sweat. Not literally, but you get the idea. Now, I'm feeling pretty good. I am a very detailed oriented person. I write everything on lists, which includes my shortterm goals, my longterm goals. Everything. And every time I think of something else that I have to do in the near or distant future, I put in on a sheet of paper. I am really nervous about my future. I hope I will live beyond the expectations I have placed upon myself. I am really getting stressed out just thinking about it right now. My head feels like it's filled with cement at this moment. I got to relax and not take the mistakes I make too seriously. I am always serious. I am not a flamboyant person. Well, my twenty minutes are up now. Time to study. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I always knew college was about being on your own and being independent. Maybe I have been so busy that I didn't realize I was completely on my own until I got sick. Being sick is just one of those things I have never had to accomplish on my own. I always had my mom to take me to the doctor and even after I could drive, I still loved her company. I also knew that she would get me my medicine and make sure I was taken good care of. Being away from my mom and that comfort zone was not very easy when I became sick. It has definitely shown me that I depend on other people a lot, especially my mom. If there is one thing I am looking forward to about college, it is growing as a person. I hope to become more independent and prepare myself for the future years ahead. I always went away to camp during the summer and spent six weeks in Israel one summer but for some reason, being in college is a much different feeling. I want to be able to do things completely on my own without consulting others, like my parents. I think the greatest thing I need to conquer is decisionmaking. I have always been bad at making up my own mind without asking someone else if I am making the right decision. I hope being in college will teach me to make good decisions and become that independent person I want to become. Already being away from home has taught me so much about myself and how it feels to be distant from that comfort zone. Just like most things, I know it will only take time and patience. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Um. well I don't know where to start. This is extremely weird and I feel like I am just going to start rambling on and on. I think I'm thinking too hard for this little assignment and it's driving me crazy I guess I'll just go off on tangents and type away. I am so bored out of my mind and everyone around me right now is talking about being hungry and going to get something to eat. I shouldn't have eaten that can of soup and should have waited and gone some place good wit my friends. What am I thinking what am I thinking about. This is so much harder than I though. I thought things were just going to flow and I'm sure that they usually do but since I'm concentrating so much things are flowing like they usually do. I'm so stressed out right now. For some reason I feel like I have a world of things to do, do I? Well I know that when I think to hard about all the things I have to do it seems like I'm never going to finish doing what I have to do. In the long run though things seem to work and yeah I'm not going to freak out. I think right now I'm going to go back to my apartment and plan out exactly what I have to do for the rest of the day then get a pen and just scratch out as I go along. I know that I'll fall asleep though. I've been so lazy lately. I think I should start running to get my blood flowing but I know myself and it'll never last. Well who knows we'll see what happens, I could just go home and clean the apartment that would be a good work out. I think I'm thinking too much about unimportant things I guess who cares I'm just going to do whatever I want to do as things come to my mind and I'm not going to force myself into jogging around and sweating then never wanted to run again. Holy cow! This is not fun at all I'm running out of thoughts and this is just becoming words jumbled on to a paper. I wonder if I'm suppose to have paragraphs and stuff oh well too bad. Is this suppose to be something important or say something about myself. If it wasn't for having to type this my day would be complete I could take a nice long nap without having to worry about getting this out on time! Ugh! Okay I wish I could just live in Austin and not go to school. I wonder what I'm going to do tonight? Nothing is fun anymore it's always all the same stuff. Um well jayne and them are coming in from San Antonio so we'll see what happens. This movie is so cheap I laugh at the stupid parts even though they make no sense what so ever. What a mess what a mess. Ugh I need to clean up my home today so bad I don't want to! I clean up and two seconds later it's a mess all over again. Okay well I'm thinking my time should be up. Is it up yet. Yes two minutes and them I'm done. I'm starving all of a sudden. I'm so frustrated with this whole thinking process It's just a mess I hope we don't have to do this all the time. I think I'm going to be disappointed when I read back on this. I'm going to see that not one productive thought runs through my mind in 20 minutes. That is so pathetic. I wonder what would happen if I didn't have to do this and I started jotting down my thoughts. Okay time is up. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm supposed to write for twenty minutes. So I think that I will write about what I know the most about. I know the most about myself. Maybe this means I'm stuck up  because I'm writing about myself and not about something important, like homelessness or starvation and poverty and other things of that nature. But if that is the case, I will just have to be stuck up. I don't know that I really understand myself, so I'm not really sure what I should say. Sometimes, I'm fairly predictable. Other times, I just don't know why I do what I do. I guess everyone could say that about themselves, so I'm not being too original here. I'll try to think of something more original. I am weird. I wonder if everyone thinks that they are weird. I am not comfortable with love, yet I crave it. I close the door in love's face when it comes knocking. I like movie love. The kind where everything just ends happily ever after. Cinderella is a perfect example. She finds the man of every woman's dreams, and gets him. I think I once found the man of my dreams. But I just wasn't ready to find him then. At least that will be my excuse for letting him get away. I wonder why people think that love is so important to find. I feel like it is the purpose of our being here. Do animals really search for the ONE? Or do they just find a new partner every season? Maybe that is what is supposed to set humans aside from animals. Everyone thinks that humans are so much smarter than animals. I think that maybe animals are much smarter. They don't mess with love. They just have mates. I bet their lives are less stressful. I guess love really isn't that stressful, as long as both people are in love. It seems to me that when you are in love, everything seems perfect. Life suddenly loses its stressfulness. I think the phrase is that it looks like you're looking at the world through rosetinted glass. Roses are nice. I love flowers in general. They smell good. They look pretty. They are such pointless gifts because they die so quickly once they are cut. But I guess that is what makes them so nice to receive  the simple fact that someone spent money on something that will only last a few days just to brighten your face for a moment. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Stream of Consciousness Where could she have gone? She has been gone for 12 hours now and she did not even tell me where she was going. She left at 1:30 in the morning and it is now one in the afternoon. All she said was she was going to buy cigarettes and she would be back in fifteen minutes. Oh God what could have happened to her. I do not know what I would do with out her. Rally what would I do if she wasn't around anymore. She is my best friend, my sister. We have been through so much together. She knows everything. Every secret, every feeling, every lie, every cry, everything. Please be okay, please be okay. Where could she have gone? She could have gone to A&M to see Adam. Or maybe she went to Waco to visit Mark. No she wouldn't do that; she has not talked to Mark since Monday. She wouldn't just leave without telling me where she was going. Maybe she went to see Charlie at Southwest. No, she couldn't have. They were in a fight last time she talked to him. Please just be safe. I am totally helpless right now. I have called everyone and left everyone messages. Who is going to call her mother? I have to tell her. No one else can do it. She is my mom too. I am the only one close enough to her to tell her what is going on here. She is there, in Houston, and she is going to freak out when she finds out here daughter has been missing for 12 hours now. I hope Susan is all right. I am going to be so relieved when I see her, if I see her. Relived, I am going to be pissed. How could she not call and tell me where she was going? It is the responsibility of a roommate to tell the other one where you are going. Who else can I call? I have to call somebody. Somebody has to know her whereabouts. I can't ever talk to anyone right now. I am hysterical. Calm down; just clam down, Cara. Everything is going to be okay. Should I wait to call her mom until after I talk to the police? NO that is wrong. It would be one in the morning when the police would finally do something. She couldn't do anything then. She would be as helpless as I am right now. That is not fair to her. She wouldn't be able to do anything at one in the morning. She would be totally freaked out in tears. Okay breathe, breathe. You can do this. Just dial the number. Come on push the buttons. Stop crying and do what you know you have to do. Stop crying, Cara. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm going to be late, why did I schedule my classes so late in the day? I heard it was better to have later classes, but isn't 2pm for my first class a bit too late? It's too much trouble to change it, and oh my gosh! How am I supposed to concentrate in a room of about 500 people with my Microeconomics professor being so plain and boring. It reminds me of my U. S. History class junior year. it was crazy, I could barely stay awake. 2pm is generally when I take my afternoon nap as well, you know? Now it's twice as hard to stay awake in that class at that time. And today I've got a 12:30pm class, which I guess is a better time, don't you think? Yesterday I had a lot of time to spare before class, so I woke up early, and went to go work out, which worked out ok. I'm going to go workout to day as well. I'm going to try to work out as much as possible. you know how they talk about the freshman 15? That scares me. I mean I can see how freshmen can gain that weight. For example, I ended up skipping breakfast yesterday, and had a big lunch, which is more that I generally would eat for a lunch. SO I end up eating more than usual. But for dinner I had a sandwich and some cereal, so I think that was better. At home I just constantly snacked, which I heard is actually better than eating full meals. But at home, I actually had food lying around the house that I could just pick up at any time. IN my dorm, on the other hand, we've got ants, so I can't just have food out everywhere. And while others have a whole pantry full of food in their dorm, I've got a box of crackers, cereal, some soup, and fruit snacks. I haven't had milk in awhile, maybe I'll have milk for breakfast today. should I? Because if I do that then I won't really have a lunch, but breakfast for lunch you know? Uhh. I don't know, Everything is pretty new. This whole college lifestyle. Oh my gosh the first couple of days I was here I was really depressed. I didn't see very many of my friends, and the friends that I was seeing weren't my closest of friends. But we went over to one of my friend's dorms the other day, and just hung out and talked about old time. now that was fun. It's hard getting all together though, because everyone's got their own schedule and things to do. It'd be nice to get together again. One day at lunch I got together with a whole group of my friends, it was a lot of fun. better than just having a boring lunch with some friends that barely even talk. And my dorm room. I mean I like it, but when you compare to other peoples dorm rooms. oh my gosh! Some people really went all out. I on the other hand, just put up a few decorations and some stickers. Well some will bust out with poster and a billion frames surrounding their bed. I mean that's cool and all, but I guess I wasn't prepared to do all that. That's another thing. A lot of people already have siblings who are going here, or have previously gone here. That's why they know so much about the organizations and the things around Austin. They also have access to a car, another thing I don't have, which can get kind of hard. What if I want to go back to Houston? I don't really feel comfortable asking just anybody for a ride, and the bus? I don't know. I haven't actually sat on a bus to go from city to city. And I don't want to make my family drive three hours to Austin, just to pick me up, and three hours back to Houston, then all over again to drop me back off to school. I don't know. they say there's so much to do on campus and to get involved, but in what?? There are so many different organizations, and the one I want, I can't find. I heard that there was an Armenian cultural association in Austin, and that'd be really cool if I actually found the members and joined. I tried to look them up online, but apparently the web site doesn't work. I'm not really open and just start talking to people, so making a whole new group of friends is not challenging, but not so easy either. My suitemate is real comfortable just talking to anybody. I on the other hand, don't find it so easy. I'm hungry. should I get some lunch? I haven't really had a real breakfast. Did I already say that? Hmm. so should I just get some cereal, because I'm not all that hungry, or should I get a lunch? I don't know, I'll just see what they have for lunch, and then I'll decide from my options. how does that sound? Uhh. and our elevator doesn't work. oh ya! There's another elevator. I walked three flights of stairs for nothing then? OH well. good exercise right? I didn't realize we had two elevators because I always just take the one I'm used to, but it's ""temporarily out of order. "" Does that mean the other one will be out of order too? Hmm. I'll go see. ok. I guess that's about it. Maybe I should start another diary. I finished the first one I had. I've had it since I was about 12. It's kind of funny looking back at all the things I wrote about. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Although I have waited until the very last minute to start this assignment, it was totally out of my control. I've been dealing with getting my laptop and setting up my Internet for about two weeks now. The Ethernet card was finally put into today, but only after harassing the front desk of my dorm about twenty times. So, now I'm connected to all my friends who either moved or do not go to UT. But, even though I might be connected, I barely ever get any real information about their lives from them. One of my best friends moved to College Station to go to school. It might be only a twohour drive, but I haven't seen her in almost a month. That is really hard when before she left we were seeing each other almost every day. And, I don't feel I'm making enough of a conscious effort to keep in touch with her. Maybe I think that if I don't speak to her then I won't miss her. I've also been overwhelmed with the changes of moving away from home, meeting new people, and getting adjusted. So, I might just be extremely busy right now, too much on my mind. I've wanted to graduate high school and be on my own since I was about twelve. I've always been extremely responsible and independent, not really seeing the need for strict authority, parents, teachers, etc. So, I figured moving out of my house and into a new environment would be a breeze. I've adjusted all right. I do my homework, don't stay out late on school nights, and go to all my classes. Psychologically though is a different story. I never realized how much I'd miss my parents, and only now do I really appreciate what they do for me. I got sick about the second week I moved into my dorm, and all I could think about was how I wanted my mom to take care of me. Me, miss independent just wanted someone to cook soup for her and tell her what kind of medicine to take. Also, dealing with campus size has been kind of hard. I grew up in a small town and went to a small high school where I practically knew everyone. I am living with a friend from high school, so that's made it a little easier. But still, I don't feel like an individual anymore. I feel like one in a huge crowd, which is exactly the case. Especially in this class. How do you get to know people when you sit by someone different every day and there are over five hundred people that walk through the doors? That's almost three times my graduating class. Five hundred is half the town of Dripping Springs. It's so different, and yet I'm only thirty miles away from home. I also haven't really found much to get involved with. I'm not into sports, and at this point I haven't really experienced anything that I love doing and want to pursue. The only thing I've really done as a group is me, my roommate, and a friend from one of my classes went to a Pill Start class. Which is what it sounds like, starting birth control. That's another thing, I got to this class, yet I'm not sexually active, and I feel like such a minority here in college. I went to the class as a preventative measure. You now, a just in case it happens when I'm drunk or not thinking straight, or maybe even if I get into a relationship where I actually trust my partner. I have this huge overwhelming fear of pregnancy, and I think that's stopped me from being intimate. And, I'm not sure if that's a good thing. Yeah, it has kept me from having sex, but I'm also in a state of fear about the issue. I'm worried my sister, my friends, anyone and everyone is going to get pregnant and that scares me. I worry so much about other people, and I feel responsible for them. Like, I'm always offering to take so and so to go get birth control. Then, they look at me like I'm a freak and explain to my how there's really no way they can get pregnant. I mean, they are using condoms. And all I can do is look at them and think ""OH My God!"" How can anyone be so nonchalant about such an important issue? If I ever got pregnant my life would change so much. It's way too much to even think about. And, I don't ever want to have to make the decision of if I should keep the baby. I love children so much, but I don't want them now, when I can't provide for them or give them the life I know they deserve. But, I don't really think abstinence is the answer either. I think that at some point I'm going to just have to get over this fear. I don't have a problem with sex; I just have a problem with all the scary things that can result from it. Ten minutes of pleasure is not worth disease, death, or even a new life (right now). "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm so tired both physically and mentally. I just want sleep, sleep, sleep. I'm so overwhelmed with everything and I can't seem to think of anything but my future. I focus more on how my life might be in the future than how my life is presently. I just feel that it's going to take forever to get where I want to be in life. I don't know why I bother with the future when I have so many things to overcome right now. I just wish I knew how it felt to be completely satisfied. Although, I don't think that is possibleto be completely satisfied. It would make my life seemingly unnatural. What is natural to me are headaches. They are a natural result of stress; stress that is the result of my acknowledgment of my shortcomings. I just want to be truly content with myself and with my life one day. I don't know if that is possible, but I'd like to think so. "
Tell me about yourself.,"It's funny how people allow themselves to be manipulated by words. I was just reading my Philosophy book, and different philosophers were arguing the pros and cons of legalizing drugs. As I read I found myself being manipulated by words. I had to step back and look at things as a whole to determine my own view on situations. I think many people are victims of the society that we have created. We live in a cutthroat world that is very demanding. People feel pressured to please others above themselves. I believe that this can be dangerous. People too often define success by how much money they have, how many cars they have, and what their resume looks like. Many times we try to obtain success at all costs; even at the cost of our own happiness and well being. Students feel pressure from many sources. Many of those sources are our parents. They feel pressure to be a success in their parents eyes no matter what the costs. Even if the costs includes the well being of their self. This is a sad occurrence. We should be encouraged by our parents. Their is a thin line between encouraging and pressuring. We look for that line and do our best to walk as close to it as possible. Its funny how our state of mind changes from time to time. We go from being majorly stressed out to being very calm. Aristotle believed that we should always surf somewhere in the middle, never getting too high or too low. I think that makes some sense. Every time I get stressed out I have to step back and look at things in perspective. Then I ask myself if this ""thing"" I'm stress about is really worth it. More times than not it isn't. My question is what is the right way to live. If we never push ourselves we never allow ourselves a chance to grow. If we push ourselves too much we run the risk of becoming depressed. I guess like everything else, it all depends on the circumstances. Some things have a tendency to stick in my head. Movie lines for example. I'm always able to remember with great accuracy. Numbers on the other hand, I don't remember so well. What causes that? Is that a gift or a flaw? I have an identical twin brother and we are total opposites. I remember movie lines and he remembers phone numbers very well. Also, we look nothing alike. Isn't that weird. Every time we meet someone and tell them we're identical twins they never believe us. Maybe the doctor made a mistake and told my mom the wrong thing. Identical twins are cool because we have the same genetic makeup. I guess that takes the individuality away a little, but hey, its just like anything else, we've got to take the good with the bad. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm mad because I had just typed for twenty minutes and now I have to do it all over again because something happened to my laptop. AHHHHHH, I'm mad. Anyways today I turned 18. I'm so happy. Now I'm just going to write about anything because I'm hungry and tired. Today was a good day until this stupid thing happened. I'm mad. Tomorrow I'm going to San Antonio and I hope me three friends from Dallas can come visit me. It'll be all of them, Johnny, Cleo, my mom, and my two sisters. Lauren's letter made me cry. It was about how proud she is of me and all that good stuff. It was sweet too. Jesse made me cry yesterday because he got me something for my birthday and I thought he hated me since I'm with Johnny and all. That was sweet of him, but I wouldn't consider going back with him because of all the bullshit he put me through. He used to hurt me more emotionally than physically, but he did both at times. My other writing assignment was all nice and this one is all about bad things. Anyways, being 18 will be cool. I finally get to go into the club legally, meaning without a fake id. I also get to get my own bank account, either Wells Fargo or the University Federal Credit Union. I also get to go get my driver's license, because I never went to driver's education. Yeah! Okay, I'm a little happy now. Johnny is a good boyfriend though. He really cares about me and puts me first on what he should put me before. Like he rather be with me than his friends. That's cool sometimes, but I saw him this summer just enough to know that he really likes me. He hasn't called me yet. Oh oh I'm sad again. I miss him, and I'm glad I get to see him and all my friends tomorrow, hopefully my friends. I still have homework or should I say dormwork to do. HAHAHAHA! Okay that was corny, but I'm still cool. Oh yeah I'm going to a party at around 9:30. Oh oh I guess I'll have to call Johnny by then if he doesn't call me. He said he was going to the mall, so maybe that's where he's at. I know he had practice today so he got out at 5, but he still hasn't called me. Well it's still light outside, so I guess that's okay. Two more minutes and I hope the my laptop doesn't mess up again. Well today was a great day and I feel like Doey Howser typing away at my computer. That was dumb but I'm mad so I guess that's okay. Well times up, bye. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, I'm sitting here at my computer on my desk thinking about what to write  gosh I cannot spell right now  this is really frustrating. It's different when you type this kind of assignment because when you write things on paper, you don't have to worry about misspelling anything because you are writing and when you type, sometimes your fingers don't type the right keys and everything gets all messed up. Well I'm going to see my boyfriend in about a week and a half my hands and fingers are getting tired of typing  and his picture is right here on top of my desk. He is so wonderful. I wish we weren't at different colleges. It would be so much easier if we were in the same city so we could see each other more often, It's only been 3 minutes since I've been doing this and I have 17 more minutes this is going to be a really long assignment. It seemed easy when I heard about it, but it really isn't that easy. My fingers really hurt and I wish I could just write this out, but I guess you have to have it in email format. Well I'm really anxious to see my boyfriend. Every time I think about him I get a really big smile on my face. I told him that even when I talk to people, sometimes I'll just smile in the middle of what I am saying because I'm thinking about him. He's in Houston, going to Rice. I was really interested in Rice a couple of years ago because my cousin, who's 4 years older than me, went there and he really liked it there. Anyway, I've been trying to book a bus ride over there, but it's pretty hard to do that, especially when I'm trying to juggle my tine between trying to book the ride and going to class and everything like that. But hopefully it'll all work out ok. It's going to be really fun because I haven't seen him since he left for Houston on August 20th. It's been so long since I've seen him. We talk on the phone occasionally, but that gets really expensive really quickly and so most of the time we just email each other and I'M each other. But his schedule is so different from mine and its hard to talk especially when I need to study but I really want to talk to him. It's so hard. Ands all this studying is getting me tired. It's only the 4th day of class and already I feel burned out from all the reading and everything ok  I think it's been about 11 minutes, uh oh  I stopped writing because I lost track of how long I have been writing but now I know so that's' good. Gosh my fingers hurt. I've never typed this much before with out taking a break. Aye ok, I need to get my wrist pad because they hurt. All right, that's better. Now, back to Jake  that's his name. He's supposed to get online again at midnight and I really hope he does. He's been going to bed really early lately and it sucks because then I can't talk to him as much as we normally talk. I love him so much. It hurts inside to think of him and I really want to be with him right now. But I don't want to talk about that to you because it's my problem, that's why I'm going to see him next Friday. I'm so excited to see him. He's seriously the best thing to happen to me for a really long time. We've gone out before, actually my freshman year of high school we were dating and we've been going out off and on since then. I seriously think we were made for each other. He is so sweet and he's really in touch with his sensitive side, and that really turns me on in a guy. I like it when guys cry too. I mean, not too much, because then it seems like they're too sensitive, but if he cries a little, it means he's sensitive and that totally turns me on. Anyway, I'm probably leaving next Thursday so that I can spend the night with my other friend, Pam, who also goes to Rice. I'm going to go to a party on Friday night with her and Jake and then I'll spend the next two nights with Jake (but we aren't going to do anything) that's another thing I really admire about him is that we both have the same morals and expectations and he is really sensitive to my feelings and wants. He has got to be the best thing going for me right now  besides of course being at UT. That is really awesome too. Anyway, I'm running about of things to say, oops that didn't make much sense, but I'm almost done  hooray! Anyway, I'm staring at my really bright yellow hilighter right now and It hurts my eyes. I need to go pick up my football tickets tomorrow after my philosophy class because I'm in the draw. I wonder how I can get 8 tickets besides mine  that makes a total of 9 tickets. My whole family is coming up to Austin for the Houston game on the 23rd because my birthday is the 24th and we are celebrating it that Saturday. Well, it's been about 20 minutes so I guess my first official psychology writing assignment is done. That makes me feel good. Well, bye! "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm sitting in the library at 4:45am once again. Now I'm wondering why it is that I insist on pulling these all nighters constantly, and doing it without proper sleep or rest. Oh well. It's really cold in here, but it always is. I really shouldn't be getting distracted by the temperature in here. I should be more worried about the EE test that I have to take this semester or the CS class that I have to pass, although neither of them are weighing on my mind with the magnitude that they should. I'm begging to miss surfing again. I thought that the three weeks home this summer would help cure me of my love of the ocean, but it didn't. It never does. I need to be playing guitar more also. I've let it slip quite a bit here lately. I know the reason for that, I've let myself get too distracted with the girls around me. I allow them too much power over my life, and my actions. But that's ok because I'm done with all of that. I'm really going to try to cut my ties to all of what is negative in my life. Well at least as far as my friends go. I've begun to realize more and more how much people use me. The funny part of it is they all think that they're getting away with something, when in fact I'm quite aware of what is going on around me and what is happening to me. I guess I just give people to much damn credit. That's another thing I'm over. Despite how much I say I don't want those people in my life I know that I crave them being there due to my own insecurities and my need to have other gay people around me. But why the hell to I feel the need to have those gay people around me? They end up making me feel more ostracized than accepted. I'll never become what they see as normal. For that matter, I don't want to become that. I don't want to go out and sleep around, and do the drugs and all that other crap. It just occurred to me that who ever reads this will think that I'm writing this solely to seem like some good kid, yeah right. I'm not, but then again, they'll never know that. I find this assignment odd. I'd love to read what other students write, and more importantly I'd love to know how much of it is truly stream of conscious writing and how much of it is just premeditated butt kissing. Once again something I'm sure I'll never know. But sure enough something I'll ponder for at least a little while. I'm sure I'll be able to use that as an intricate procrastination method when I should be studying for one of the many classes that I'm taking this semester which are surely going to kill me. Man, I meant to pay my phone bill today. I've got to do that tomorrow. My credit is going to be so screwed. I've screwed up so bad as far as money goes this past few years, well actually it's been this past year. I just don't even like to think about money. It makes me sick to my stomach every time I think about it. If I were the least bit intelligent I would learn to budget or even better yet keep a check book like a normal person but oh no. God, there's that damn word again, ""normal"". I've come to despise that word. It seems like everywhere I turn I'm being bombarded with it, and what's worse is the fact that no matter who's throwing it at me I'm not fitting it. I just hate that word. Who's right is it to decided weather or not I'm normal. Who gets to decide what is normal. I think that's what I want to be when I grow up. the one who decides what's normal. No I don't want to do that, changed my mind. I don't want to put any more labels into this world than already exists. Speaking of things I've got to do soon, I need to change my oil. Since Chris and I drove to Dallas yesterday that put me nearly 200 miles where I was supposed to change it. I used to never let it get that far over. School has become such a distraction to my life. I know it's bad when my parents keep telling me that I'm working too hard and taking school too serious. I guess it all goes back to working hard at school as being a way of running away from everything else. It's just so much easier to come up to the library and work, and at least do something productive, rather than sitting around and dwelling over the drama and crap that exits in my life. Most of which I can't do a damn thing about. That's another thing I need to work on accepting what I can change and what I can't. I seem to get it in my mind that I solve the problems of the world. Before I do that I need to get my own life straightened out. I can't even get a date, and I think I can give the world leaders advice as to how to prevent war. Ok, sure Heidi, you can't even have a relationship with someone your own age who speaks you're language and you think you're going to go and create world peace with people who don't even speak English, sure. Talking about impossible problems I wonder when my new computer will get here. I really need to start on my program for my CS class. There's another thing that just makes me sick every time I think about. To think that I've got to get an A in that class to go to Germany next year just scares the crap out of me. Not much scares me. A lot of things will worry me. I worry too much. I try to deny it when other people tell me that, because common what the hell do they know about me? Well, Kid, a lot. I swear I get worried about the kid who's lonely their first year at college on the AT&T commercials. Alright that's a little overboard again, but oh well. I need to go buy some new study CD's this week. NO, NO. No more spending money. Where do I think I'm going to get this money from? DO I think it's just going to come to me when I'm not working or anything? And I know damn well that as soon as I get that new computer all I'm going to want to do is buy DVDs and programs for that crap. That's the last thing I needed to get on my laptop was a DVD player. That's just great. Now I can come to the Library to study and sit and watch a movie. And knowing me, that's something I would do just to show off my new toy. And I know that's part of the reason that I spent the extra money what to say that I've got a laptop with a DVD player on it. I say I'm not worried by what other people think, and I really don't think I am, but I sure as hell love it when they think I'm cool. Or even better yet, when they envy me. I think I get off on the whole envy thing because it makes me feel as though if there is a reason for people to envy me then my life isn't as messed up and pathetic as it seems most of the time. It's really not that bad, I just think I need to be on antidepressants. That's really common with the whole ADHD thing, but then again the whole ADHD thing brings in a whole new question of who has it, how to diagnose etc. It's really scary to see that these are the things that I think about when I've got free time to think. I really need to find a hobby of some sort. I mean I have one, I have several actually, but it's not really things I just sit and think about. Well music is, but I'm not going to sit here and write songs. I'm not in the songwriting mood. Although, if I didn't have so much work to do I wouldn't mind working on my comic book. I'm getting started on another character. I've got enough male characters the next one will be a female. Not quite sure any of the particulars yet. I'm sure it will be something along the line of goodlooking, selfsufficient, muscular, you know all of those things that most people don't relate to being in package deal with women. Ah, I like this song. It always reminds me of home. I miss my parents right now. I don't get home sick often but when I do it really hits me hard. It's hard to believe that I've been gone from home for two years now. It just doesn't seem real. So much has happened. This past year has changed my life without a doubt. I mean I never thought I would get the courage to tell my parents that I'm gay, or for that matter I never thought that I would get the courage to tell my sisters. What blows my mind is the fact that now I can sit and talk about it to my mom and dad more openly than I ever saw my sisters do with their straight relationships. Family, man. Another think that hurts to think about. I wish we could do with all the crap. I wish there wasn't the stupid petty shit that there is. I'd really love to know who is Waxahachie told my sisters that I'm gay. I mean someone else has to know from the way the whole town knows. I wish I knew that Sonja, my own flesh and blood would stand up for me, but then again I know that's never going to happen. I've sat though too many gaybashing sessions with her. That's another thing that just amazes me, how the same people can raise three kids, it what seems to be the exact same way, and they can turn out so different. Speaking of raising kids, I need to decide about grandpa's funeral. I really really don't want to give the eulogy. I had so much contempt for this man not 6 months ago, but then again I know that I should because it's one of his last wishes. Why should I honor his last wishes though? What has he done for me? That's wrong of me to say. I know that, and I know that in the end no matter how much I don't want to do it, I'll end up speaking at his funeral. That's right I need to call them tomorrow and see what the Dr. said, then I need to call the Dr. and see what they have to say. Never can get the same story from both. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Personally I feel really stressed out. I am a freshman at a very big university. I hardly know anybody and I feel very depressed and lonely all by myself. I am really close to my family so it is very hard to be eight hours away from them. I know this is a new experience, but I am just simply not happy here right now. Many people tell me that I'll get used to it, but I wish the process of adjusting could be a lot faster. I feel as if I should just give up this great opportunity to be at a great university and just go back home. I don't want to let anybody down, for example my whole family. The pressure to do good in school and not give up is so intense. I want to do something with my life, but sometimes I just look for the easy way out. I didn't know that adjusting to college life would be so difficult. How am I supposed to keep up with all this work that is assigned to me. My time management and study skills have not kicked in yet. I miss my whole family back at home. All I can do is get stressed out, I need to find a way to just chill out. I'm worried about basically everything I can think of. I don't know if I'm going to pass my classes, can I manage much longer here by myself, and are people going to accept me for who I am. I'm just not ready for such a drastic change as this one. I have hardly any money left, and I have not even found a job yet. I really need some help to figure out what I am going to do. I really don't know what buses to take to get to certain places. I get really frustrated reading all sorts of maps. Many times I feel as if I'm not even smart enough to be at a great university like this one. I think that is what my problem is, I just don't give myself enough credit. My brother tells me to think positive and he believes that I will make it here. I can not wait to go back home and see my whole family again. I wish I could be a Senior with only one year to go. Though that is not the case because I am a freshman, with many more years to go. Then again what else better do I got to do than studying and working. I would simply waste time and my life doing nothing at all. I want to be successful in life and have a good paying job. I know that is the reason I am willing to study and work hard. Knowing that when all this is done a job will be open to me. Hopefully a good paying job to support all my dreams in life. I really do hope I can make it here at UT. Right now as a freshman I really need all the hope and desire to help me get through this year. Hopefully when this year is over I will be glad because I made it through all my classes. I know study groups would really help me right now. I really dislike reading, but I know I'll have to do a lot of reading as a college student. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I feel that I am not very satisfied with school right now. I don't have that many friends but I am sure that I'll start making some soon. I miss my home and my miss my family and I miss my girlfriend who is also in fort worth. I always talk to her and I wish she was here all the time. I miss her a lot and all I can think about is being able to talk to her. school seems a little hard. I haven't gotten used to the studying habits yet. I know that I will soon get back into the grove though. I can't wait until I get to go home this weekend. I want to go home every weekend but I know I can't. it is so hot out side and I want things to cool down just a little bit. I want to be able to go out and play but I don't like going to parties and that's all people want to go do. so it seems like there isn't ever anything to do down here unless you go to a party. all I want to do is go home. it is a lot more fun at home. I don't understand why people say college is so fun when I haven't really had any fun yet. I don't want to join any frats because I don't think they're worth it. and I also hear that they make enemies also. and I don't want to make any enemies down here. my classes are kind of confusing. and since I don't know any body in the classes, I don't feel comfortable asking the people next to me questions. the weeks go by so slow. the only thing that I like about school so far is that I get done with school on Friday at eleven o'clock. that way I can leave for fort worth much sooner. my arms are starting to hurt and I still have just gotten started. time is going by so slow. I want to get out of my supplement housing. I don't like having a room with three other guys. and I don't like my room not having a sink or a mirror. I sort of like the big classes though. it makes class seem more fun. I am so sleepy right now. I don't know if I want to do my home work any more. I might just want to go home and take a nap. my room is so cold. we tried to get the a/c turned down but it still blows super cold air. and plus I sleep on the top bunk right by the a/c vents so it blows right on me. I always get a really cold nose in the middle of the night. and I also have a room mate with a really loud alarm. his alarm constantly goes off and he keeps hitting the snooze button. so every nine minutes it goes off again and again and again. it's so annoying. it's like just freaking wake up or turn off your alarm. I don't understand these people. and would be trying to sleep and then he walks into the room and turns on the lights which light up the whole room. and I'm trying to sleep. he has a little lamp but he doesn't use that instead. talk about no consideration. I don't like having to go down the hall to the bathroom just to brush my teeth. or going down to the bathroom just to put some lotion on my face. I want to be able to just wake up and do all that in front of a sink and a mirror that I don't have and what every body else does. I am getting tired of writing and I'm glad that the twenty minutes is almost up. I wonder if you guys are really going to be reading this thing all the way through. I wonder if you think I'm weird for saying some things that I have said. I wonder if I'm the only person that feels this way. last time I played basketball and now I am very sore. it's hard for me to walk around. I think I'm about to fall asleep on the computer. I can barely keep my eyes open. well sorry guy but my twenty minutes just about to up. bye bye and I hope y'all have a good day. "
Tell me about yourself.,"This is beyond weird! I never thought that college could be so exciting and scary at the same time. It is so weird how my thoughts have progressed through these two weeks of college. I never thought that things would be this independent. I am finally away from my mother and father who always told me what to do since I was a tiny little ballerina princess. No more telling me what to do or when to get back. And yet the weirdest thing about all this is the fact that I feel no urge to go out and party on sixth street. I guess all that time my parents were telling me what to do and when, was all taken into consideration when I moved up here. In changing the subject, I just came down with a throat infection and it is the worst ever. I told my parents that I had to get my tonsils taken out a long time ago but they never listened to me. It is not fair. I had the worst night's sleep last night and to top it all off, I have to catch up on all my class readings which means no catching up on sleep. I am such an observer when it comes to just walking down the street or on my way to classes. It is so funny how people I know act in a bizarre way around others compared to how they act in front of me. The other day I caught myself looking at a little boy no older than seven years old, and he caught my eye because he was on top of his dad's shoulders doing the ""hook 'em horns"" sign with his tiny little fingers. It was the cutest thing because it reminded me of when I used to get on top of my father's shoulders and do the exact same thing. In a blink of an eye though, it all seems but a distant memory. It is so weird how I always dreamed of going off away from my Rio Grande Valley life and coming to live my life far away from all the kind of people I could not stand. Do not get me wrong, I loved my family and ""real"" friends, but there was just something about that town and how everything ran on the game of politics. It was all about what kind of car you drove, where your family came from, how they were connected to some of the richest people in town, and so on. It all meant nothing to me in the end because the way I saw it was soon I was getting out of there with some place to go where people did not care about things like that. I accomplished everything I wanted in high school. The highlights were getting head drum major two years in a row and winning homecoming queen and getting to conduct in my white gown in front of my band, my family, and in front of everyone in Weslaco! It was an awesome day. The best days were when we would attempt to study for an extremely hard economics test by going over to someone's house and actually doing no studying at all. Those were the best because even though we saw each other in class, it was just on a 'hi' and 'bye' basis. When we got together, we would get each other caught up on the latest gossip and laugh about the stupidest things all the way into the night. Somehow, we all managed to pass the test the next day and we all felt better knowing that we had connected the previous night. Talking about people in our school was the main thing because our school was made up of all kinds of want tobe's, gangsters, stupid people who actually fooled everyone into thinking they were smart, and so on. Unless you were in band or on a varsity team, the people you hung out with were not at all your friends. It was the best feeling knowing that so many friends were there at band practice everyday and tennis as well. I would have to say the only thing really excellent about my old school were the faculty. My band directors were my closest friends and still are to this day as well as my tennis coaches. They always went above and beyond the call of duty to try and help with whatever I needed. Now that I am gone, I guess it is time for them to help raise another bunch of good students and friends. I feel really good leaving that small town, not knowing what to expect out here in Austin. My morals and ideas my parents, friends, and teachers taught me through the years will always remain a part of me no matter where I go! "
Tell me about yourself.,"My English teacher should go back to her own country. She read my essay today, and she couldn't understand a word on it. My topic is on samesex marriage, but she didn't even know that samesex marriages are illegal in the U. S. She read through the whole thing and asked me, ""So what is your point?"" At first, I thought it was just me, so I took it to the writing center. In a way, I just wanted to talk to someone. I had to complain about her to someone. Anyways, the guy in the writing center agreed with me. It's not my problem that she can't read. Well, I guess it is since she is the one who's going to grade my paper, but I am not going to put up with her. I am so going to change my teacher tomorrow. I am so glad that I still have the chance. I feel really relieved because my rough draft is done. I finally feel like I am getting somewhere with my paper. I am also very excited because the weekend is coming up. I am going to finish my homework in one day and enjoy the rest of my weekend. Maybe I will do my homework for the next week ahead of time so I will have more time during the week. I don't know. I seem to be addicted to homework lately. My dad said that I won't be happy if I move out. Well, I don't think that is true at all. I admit that college life is much harder than I have ever imagined, but living with him doesn't change that a bit. It's not like he could help me with my homework. He never did anyway. I feel so relieved after I moved out. It's great that I only have to deal with school. Dealing with my dad is much harder than anything else. I haven't really talked to my mom for a week now. I don't really know if I should call her. She is so worried about me. In a way, she is giving me a lot of stress. We are always talking about the same thing now. She keeps trying to convince me to move back. There is just no way that I am going do it. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Hi, I will start off by introducing myself. My name is Eric Michael Beeson, and I am 19 years old and a second year student at the University of Texas at Austin. I chose this time to talk because I have something very important on my mind. I met this girl about 3 months ago exactly, to this day at summer school (ACC), and we've been going out for about 1 month and 1/2 now. Within the last 2 weeks, I've been becoming very sad, and I think it may be due to our relationship. She does something that i've never had an exgirlfriend do before, and that is. she likes to ""hangout"" with her exboyfriend. It didn't bother me at first, I guess probably because we were just dating and not serious, but within the last month we became very serious and fell in love with each other. This is the first time i've ever been in love, by the way. I have become very jealous of this guy and sometimes even suspicious. I don't think I have suspicions of my girlfriend cheating on me, but that her exboyfriend will put a move on her, and she will realize she misses him and go back to him. I really don't know what to do. She promises me that they are just friends (you can tell we've talked about this a lot), and she does spend more time with me. Maybe i'm just insecure. I've never had a girlfriend stay loyal to me, and that's probably why I fear the same thing happening again. While i'm writing this paper she is with this guy. Let me tell you a story about what happened 2 days ago. It was a Saturday night, and I just got back to my dorm room from work around 9:00pm. At 9:10 pm, my girlfriend calls, and I ask her ""What's up?"" I was expecting her to have some plans for us, but instead she calls to tell me she's ""checking on me"" and that she's going to her exboyfriend's house to watch Saturday Night Live with him because it's a tradition they have had for awhile. I became upset, as you could imagine, and she could tell on the phone. I told her that my roommate and I were going out, and that I would talk to her some other time then. So, my roommate and I prep to go out. I should probably mention that I have had a habit of doing dip, snuff, tobacco, or whatever the proper term is for it, and i've been attempting to break the habit for my girlfriend since she hates it. Well, I grab the last dip can I had in my room (it was in the trash can half empty), and I put the biggest dip all along my lower lip. I was so pissed off! My roommate and I then start walking out the doors to our cars, and as I walk out the sliding door, there she is! First thing she says to me is. ""You have dip in. "" We were a couple of very angry people that night. She had canceled plans with her exbf to come see me. I was then obligated to cancel with my roommate. We walked into my dorm room, and had a long talk that night. She was very upset at me for dipping, but she is also trying to reassure me that she and her exboyfriend are just friends and nothing more. It's very hard for me to cope with. I don't want to break up with her because I like her so much, and I feel we are very compatible aside from this one issue that I don't see eyetoeye with her on. I'm going to try to go along with this and maybe get to know her exboyfriend a little bit better. Maybe that will help me. Only time will tell. Well, it's been fun, but my time is up now. Thanks. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am pretty proud of myself today, for I got much more accomplished than I thought I would. I figured that after my last class I would just take a nap. But instead, I went to the gym and had a great workout. It's always good to make a plan of everything that you want to do in a day. I always have to do lists. They are so useful, and I feel so organized when I make them. And when I finish everything on one list, I feel so good. It is a great feeling. I haven't been having too many great feelings recently. I'm not sure if I like it here. I don't think I ever will either; that is what bothers me the most. Everyone keeps telling me that it is going to get better, that I'll meet more and more people that I like. I just don't think it's going to happen. I really wish I had gone to Brandeis, for things would be so much easier. It is a smaller school, near Boston, much closer to my parents. Then I'd be able to see Brian and Jessie so much more often. I probably could see them every weekend if I wanted to. My phone bill would definitely be a hell of a lot less. That would be so good, because I don't have enough money. I feel bad asking for more from my parents, but it would just be so much easier. I think I really want to apply for that job at George Women. That is definitely a cool store because it has everything that I love there! Another thing I have noticed about being a college student, is that now I don't care about how I look or dress or anything like that. In high school, it was such a big deal to wear the ""right"" clothes and things like that. I didn't even mind doing that, and it seemed normal. I just miss my friends so much. I made such great connections with three people in high school, and I miss them so much. I am so jealous of all my friends who are so close to each other. Why do I have to get stuck with going to this huge school? It's not fair that I have to go through so many changes all at the same time. I just wish things were easier. It would make me so much happier. I feel like I have done something awful, that I deserve to feel like crap. I know that if I just keep on going, day by day, then things have to get better. I'm just so used to having so many friends and knowing so many people. I have just gotten thrown into this huge pile of people, and not knowing any of them is just plain weird. I just hope that getting use to this school will be a lot easier and quicker than it seems like it will be. I think that things will become so much better once I get used to this school. I certainly hope so because I just want to be happy. "
Tell me about yourself.,"The first thing that comes to mind as I sit here is an immense feeling of relief. I have just finished the rough draft of my Rhetoric paper. It's due tomorrow and I wasn't sure I could pull it together. It's not up to the standard of writing I like, but that's why it's a rough draft. I find myself dwelling a lot on on my life since I got here. I know that sounds a little weird, but it's actually a good thing. The first night I was here, I was sitting back listening to my music and reading when I thought about home and everything that had gone on there. I remembered everything from my close friends my senior year of high school to my friends from way back in my elementary school days. It wasn't homesickness. Something about the song I was listening to made me just stop and think about how lucky I am. I've had a great life. My parents were very supportive in whatever I did and still are. My friends were always there for me and I never endured any life tragedies. The truth is that I really have no explanation as to why that song triggered memories of home. It just brought back mental photos of friends, girlfriends, and what I personally considered an ideal life. I really do think I've led an ideal life. Never hurt for money, never abused, never had problems making friends. The only thing I consider a life tragedy is the fact that I didn't get a new car for graduation, but it was that or tuition and I fought to hard to get here to not come. I think that I'll love it here. Actually, I already do. Most people say that you will get incredibly homesick and even want to come home early on in your first year of college. I don't see how. The people around me are great, my classes interest me, and I'm never bored. I don't not miss home, but I'm not sitting in my dorm room crying about the good old' days either. As far as I'm concerned, the good old' days are just beginning. I'm really looking forward to this weekend and the next. This weekend I'm probably going out to a club with a group of girls, one of which I am finding myself attracted to. The next weekend is another football game. I'm in the band, so football games are a fun time for me. Marching in front of 80,000+ people is intimidating, but it's also a rush that words really can't do justice for. Of course, that's only half the fun. The real fun from football season comes from goofing off in the stands. I'm glancing at my clock and see that I've only got about ten minutes left? How am I going to ramble on for another ten minutes. I write fiction stories for fun, love English, and am a Journalism major. Rambling writing style for me. I wonder why I'm occasionally having trouble continuing. Who knows? Psychology is supposed to be able to tell what makes me tick. Maybe one of ya'll will find something interesting about my personality from all these completely random thoughts. This is harder than I thought. Maybe it's because there's not a structure to it. When I write, even a fiction story on my own for fun, there's some kind of structure. A plot, guidelines to follow, something that serves as a skeleton for me to put some meat on. Just writing off the top of my head is something new. Well, not new, but usually the ideas I get off the top of my head are related to a particular subject and I can plug them into a structure. That's actually how I start a lot of my English papers. Start off the top of my head and find a flow. After that, it's all easy, but here there's not even a skeletal structure to set my ideas on. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I love college. Although it is very hard work at times, you learn a lot about yourself and other people. I enjoy being in Austin, although my family lives in Fort Worth. This is my second year hear and so far I like how things are going. Of course there is always bumps on the road, but you learn to get by. Sometimes I miss being home with family and friends, especially because my best friend lives in Ft. Worth. We've been the best of friends for nine years now. It seems like a long time. I have so many memories and I like to dwell in them from time to time. My dog ran away. I just felt like adding that in. I just came home from work and found one of my fish dead in the tank. I don't know what happened, the other two are fine. I just got these goldfish. I guess I bought them because I miss my fish back home. I have six huge goldfish back home. They have been part of our family for almost six years now. They are getting pretty old. One of them is blind, I think, because he keeps bumping in to the aquarium's glass wall. I am enjoying all my classes so far. Let's see if I feel that way once testing time comes around. I am a bio major. I love biology. I think it is one of the most interesting subjects around. It is so complex and always changing. I want to go to medical school after I obtain my bio degree. I am kind of worried that I won't be accepted to any medical school. What will I do with a biology degree? I like to do research, so maybe I'll do that. I have done research in diabetes in the past. My grandmother has diabetes. I believe that is one of the reasons that I want to do research on diabetes. She lives in El Salvador. It is such a beautiful country and they have the most amazing beaches. I visited my grandmother this past summer. I spend a month there. This country is developing so fast; I didn't even recognize the colony I grew up in. Of course there are still some underdeveloped sections, but it seems like it's becoming more industrialized every time I visit. Ok, back to medical school. Being a doctor is what I have always wanted to be. Sometimes I think that there is nothing else I can do. I can't wait to go to medical school and actually work in hospitals. I went to a medical profession high school. We were able to work at different hospitals. We had a fist hand look at part of the medical field. I even got to help in various procedures like suturing, administering medication, giving vaccines. What I enjoyed the most was working in the ER. Sometimes it is very slow, but there are times when patients are coming in left and right. I was able to help bag a patient who had just had a cardiac infarction. It became pretty stressful at times. Afterwards you get a great feeling of satisfaction. I t is a feeling that you have helped someone in a time where they needed help the most. You can never forget that feeling and that is why becoming a doctor is one of the most important things in my life. Besides my spiritual life, a relationship with God, and my family and friends, that feeling you get when you help a person in a crucial point is the thing I want the most. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I have done this twice now and erased it both times. I wish I could do it on a different program but my computer is broken and I don't exactly know how to use my neighbors that is letting me borrow hers. I've been thinking a lot about my family lately. I guess I'm finally realizing that I'm here for good. I'm used to going on long trips in the summer so I know what it's like to be away from home and my mom and dad but this is so different. It feels like it's a point with no return. Even if I live with them during the summer which is a possibility it won't ever be the same. The days of grade school at home are over. I really miss my mom. She is my best friend. Really though so is my dad and my brother Seth. It is amazing how close we are. I feel so fortunate. In my marriage and family class we talked about a healthy and strong family and I feel like my family met most all of the items on the list. We have so many memories together. I'm so lucky to have my brother. My brother's good friend died when they were in 10th grade. It was the hardest thing ever for our youth group at church. I miss my church so much. It is such a home to me. My best friends are from my church. It is so sad that I will never be in a youth group again as a youth. I ay end up going on trips as a sponsor or something but it will never be the same. I'm at somewhat of peace with the change but it still makes me sad when I realize the little things like not having to rush around on Sundays in order to be back for choir, supper, and bible study. The things that can drive you crazy are the things you miss. I miss my cat. He is so old. I remember when he was a tiny baby in 1988. He find us and adopted us. We named him Kitty Duke after Michael Dukakis' wife who we were voting for that year (it was Election time) but soon found that he was a he so we changed it to Duke. Everyone says that it sounds like a big dog's name but oh well. He is an orange tabby cat. It seems like he used to be fatter but maybe I've just gotten bigger. We've been through a lot. W e used to play together all the time. I'd sing to him when he was a baby. Without my brother I would be such a different person. He has helped form me in so many ways. He is my hero. I think the world of him. I didn't always though, like when he would hit me on the head or do ""gross"" things in my face as a normal big brother should do. But I'm very lucky to be so close to him. I try not to talk about him around Caitlyn, Jake's little sister. When he died she was in 4th grade. They were so close. I remember it all like it was yesterday. Getting the call at 6 the next morning. I had seen hi that Sunday night that he died at church and I remember him giving me that half smile that he did and me melting along with the rest of the girls in youth group. I talked to Catilyn about it for the first time this summer since it happened when she was in fourth grade. She broke down one night in Montana when we were on mission tour. We were all sharing what something meant to us and several people ended up relating it to their siblings. She just broke down which was a first. I talked to her and told her that I hated talking about Seth around her because Jake and him were the same age. She said that she loved hearing about Seth but she just wished that she had an older brother so badly. She said it like any other person who had never had a brother would say it. My brother is getting married this summer. It is so strange. I love Lauren. She is already just like my sister. They have been together for four years now. At first I was so jealous because I felt like she was taking my place as my brother's best friend. I soon realized that we had very different places in Seth's life and that there is room for both of us. I have Seth' past and we both have his future. My Family and I used to drive to our cabin in east Texas and have the best time. Seth and I would play so hard. On the way down we would always eat at the same fast food place and get burgers and icecream. Seth would always comment on the fresh air as soon as we got out of the car in the woods. It's funny what a family thinks is so humorous that would mean nothing to others. On the way down he would always try to explain the wonders of the earth to my mom and me like the stars and solar system and physics and things that Ginny and Anne Claire Hickman would probably never grasp. That's one thing I adore about my family. We all contribute different things. We are so different but so alike. I miss days of being with just us. We always traveled a lot. I think I'm just trying to let go of that time in my life right now. With me leaving for college and Seth getting married, it's a whole new chapter. We have the best traditions. Even food traditions like Chicken and Cheese soup on Christmas Eve and Asparagus on Easter. I hope to start traditions with my own family. I miss my room, my bed, my church, the familiarity of Ft. Worth roads, my boyfriend Blake and his house and my best friends from church. Blake would be a fantastic husband and father. I always say that if I don't marry him than I'll marry someone just like him. I wonder how my parents came up with our traditions. Like every Christmas Eve, Seth and I open one present, an ornament. Mine are always angels and his are always bears. Eventually we added my mom and dad with cats and Santa's. My mom doesn't even like cats. When she was little her dad expected her to like the animals and be near them so I think that's why she doesn't like them. They had a farm. She hated her dad. I can't imagine. When we drive to Oklahoma to see my grandmother, we always have very soul bearing conversations, some of our best in fact. She would always tell me about her childhood because I was so interested. Her dad was so difficult. In two weekends we're all going to Duncan, Ok. My uncle is coming in from Florida so we all are driving in. It will be great. I'm very close to my cousins and I really don't see them that often at all. At Thanksgiving when we were little we used to all cram into my Grandmother's house and each get one kernel of corn at our place which represented one thing we were thankful for. We each said it aloud before we ate. Another great tradition. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I wander if I will go to psychology today. I don't feel like it since my car is in the shop today. I still need to go to the bank and return the DVD player. Should I exchange it or get my money back since I don't have much money. At least I don't have to go to work. I can't wait until I graduate only one more year. Oh yeah I have to do some reading today but I am having trouble concentrating. My thumb is hurting from typing. I think it is mainly from my old job but typing is aggravating it. I guess my thoughts are drying up because I am trying to write but I normally can't stop thinking about stuff. I really want to go to Italy but Loly is saying we don't have money. oh well we will see. She is frustrating because she is not focused on her future. I just want us to be done with school as soon as possible. I can't wait until I start working I hate not having enough money. I probably need another job now because I only work about 10 hours a week. when I get back I need to put my car for sale. It better not take to long in the shop like last time. I'm getting tired of this writing. I really need to get my stuff together so I don't fall behind in my reading but most of the reading is really boring. psy is kind of interesting but architecture and accounting, two classed I like are boring to read. Ill be glad when I only have a job and not a job and school. it should be fun to go home this week but I wont go back for a long time today. I'm tired of hearing about those damn firestone tires. I should invest in stock. the tv is on that's why I'm rambling. Morgan is going to be bought by chase Manhattan. I new I should have bought their stock. But no money to back it. c'est la vie I don't know if I spelled that right but oh well. well I'm just about done and none to soon. I wander what I will do tonight I'm not going to psy today. today was a lazy day. well see you next assignment. have a nice day. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am in a hurry right now. I have a retreat to go to in 20 minutes, which is at the end of this writing. I feel very rushed and very sweaty. Personally, I don't like long term assignments. I usually end up doing things at the last minute (like now) usually do to forgetfulness on my part. That's one of those college things that I have to adjust to. Other things I have to adjust to are the food, independency, new friends, new people, different people, persecution, etc. , etc. However, I really like this place because of the above reasons. For a majority of my life, I've been mostly independent, living in a singleparent family with one younger sibling. My mom took care of me and my brother, but she would always work. I didn't have much of a father figure growing up either. My parents got divorced, and my dad moved to Taiwan and got remarried. I stayed with my brother and my mom in Dallas. During those times, I grew and learned a lot about life, by myself. That was the catch. Everyone learns about life, the right things, the wrong things, in some way or form, usually from their parents. However, since my mom always worked, and I didn't have a father figure, I learned about life by myself. I made mistakes, I made several wrong decisions, and I did things that I regret. However, I also learned a wealth of knowledge that I feel others my age do not possess. I was ahead of the peers around me, in life and in experiences. My independency started at an early age, one could say. I learned to take care of my brother, as well as other everyday tasks. Do you know how many people on this campus don't know how to do their laundry?! It's insanely too many. For many students, their parents have pampered them and done their laundry for them for their whole lives. And then they come to a university where they have to do it by themselves and have no clue what detergent to use, how much, how to separate clothes, or even what fabric softener is. In the past 3 weeks, I've done my laundry twice now in the dorms. I live in San Jacinto, and since their is construction going on, our laundry hours are from 6pm to 5am. These hours suck because from 6 to about midnight, there are people crowding the place. Also, I'm usually out during those times, at the gym, arcade, eating, whatnot. So, the last two times I've done laundry, it's been at 3am in the morning. The washing cycles takes 30 min while the drying takes 45 min, totaling to about an hour and half, given loading and transferring time. The first time I did it, my roommate was with me. We stuck our clothes in at 3am, and came back at 4 to stick it in the dryer. But at 5:15am, we realized that our laundry was still down there. However, we were still in our room playing video games. We ran down there and found that the door was locked. Our clothes were stuck in the laundry room for the rest of the day. We wouldn't be allowed in until 6pm that day. This was especially bad for me because I had practically run out of pants. However, I seemed to have made it through. So, the second time I did laundry, I did it myself. Again, it was at 3:30 in the morning when I stuck it in. This time, however, I made sure that I wouldn't get locked out. So during washing and drying, I slept on the ground by the laundry room door. My drying actually didn't finish until about 5:20am. To my dismay, they did not lock the door this time at 5. I was very frustrated and tired; but glad I had clean clothes. Anyway, I miss my family. I really don't want to live with them again. I just want to see them and talk to them more than I already do. My mom calls me everyday. I think it's annoying, but I'm sad because I think it's annoying. My younger brother is getting involved with some bad friends and school, and our mutual friends tell me about it, but I can't do anything. I'm also sad because of that. There are more reasons I'm sad. The drawing for tickets for the Texas vs. OU game went on yesterday(Thursday). Each student had to get a wristband with a certain number on it (mine was 45987). It was given out at random. They started the drawing on Thursday with number 43001. By 43800, tickets were already sold out. Guess I won't be going to the game. That really stinks. It's ok though it would've cost me $35. I'd rather go to free games anyway. I think my 20 minutes are about up now. Again, I am still in a hurry to leave, since my ride for the retreat will be leaving soon. Goodnight. sort of good afternoon. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am so exhausted. These last few weeks since school has started has worn me out. I have pretty much no energy, and I got ten hours of sleep last night. My brain is also exhausted from all the partying I have been doing since I got here. I can't wait for tonight. I am going to club Elements, and I am going be wasted. I love techno music. It is so awesome. It is crazy how a DJ can put all sorts of different beats together at once and make it sound so perfect. I could listen to techno music all day long. I am listening to techno music right now. Every time I hear techno music it makes me want to dance and have a good time. Anyways, I hope Texas kicks some ass on Saturday. I love watching UT play football and tear it up. College football is the best sport in the world to watch. My other favorite team to watch in college is Michigan. My dad went there so I have been a true Michigan fan ever since I was little. I even went to the Rose Bowl in 1997 when they played Washington State. They won and Michigan ended the season undefeated and number one in the nation. In choosing the college that I wanted to go to, it was a choice between Michigan and UT. My brother graduated from UT a few years ago and I really looked up to him greatly as a kid. I finally decided to follow my brother and go to UT. So far I feel it was a great choice. Austin is an awesome city that fits well with my personality. I decided that if I want to continue my studies and get a masters degree, then I will probably go to Michigan for that. Right now, that is my plan for the next seven or eight years of my life. However, I really don't know what exactly I want my major to be. Anyways, off of that subject, there are so many fine girls here. Everywhere I look there is another girl that I want a piece of. I t is awesome. I have never seen so many hot chicks in my life. The whole experience of living down here so far has been awesome. I can do whatever I want, whenever I want. And it is great living far away from home. Nothing beats coming in at five in the morning and not having to hear my mom or dad bitch at me. Actually, my parents were very good parents and usually let me have my space. They learned after the first two kids what it is like parenting kids, so they were pretty loose with me. I really do kind off miss my parents. They are very good people who gave me a lot during my stay at home and they would do anything for me. They have always been there for me even when I have been in trouble with authorities and other high officials. Not that I was a bad teenager or anything, but I think everyone who likes to party a lot, like me, have had their share of conflict with the cops. Anyways, twenty minutes is up, so bye. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm starting to write this at six twenty five, It's really cold in this computer lab, I wish they would turn the air conditioner down, do they know how to do that, would they do it if I asked them, probably not, but I wish they would, there sure is a lot of typing noise going on in the room, no one is talking, I am thinking more things that I am actually typing, it is really hard to write everything that I think and I type a lot slower that my brain thinks thoughts, thoughts, thoughts, thoughts, I am not thinking of much right now, the professor is going to think my writing is dumb if he reads it, he probably won't read it though, and he probably won't really think it is dumb, there are probably students who write dumber ones than me. I am horrible at typing, I am making all kinds of mistakes, I hope I can read this a when I finish it, or else there will be a problem, brrrr It's really cold in here, I sure wish they would make it warmer. My fingers and my feet are freezing, and I'm already bad enough at typing, the cold makes it even harder to type, geeze I'm going to have to do a lot of spell checking after I finish this, I only have about ten minutes of typing left, I just heard someone's cell phone ring and they are not supposed to have cell phones in this computer lab, I always hear phones ring in here anyways, I wonder if anyone ever gets in trouble for that, they should turn their phones off, so they don't disrupt other people, even though personally it doesn't bother me if I hear a phone ring but I guess if nobody turned theirs off then they would all be ringing all the time and then all the ringing would get annoying, gosh I can't spell worth anything, I'm hardly going to be able to read this when I get done, I hope I can decipher it, my feet are freezing, I keep repeating the same thoughts over and over but maybe that's the point of this exercise that you think a lot of things and many of them are repeated. I wonder if its raining outside, that sure was a random thought that came out of nowhere, I wonder why I thought of that, hhhmmm, I saw all the clouds earlier outside, it was really dark and scary looking, I hope it rains a lot more, more than yesterday, it didn't rain enough yesterday, I love when it rains, it's better than the sunshine, I wonder if that means I'm a negative person, it can't though cause I am such a positive and optimistic person, well at least I think of myself as optimistic, I try to be optimistic but sometimes its hard, like last week I was so stressed out with all the band stuff, I'm really glad I quit band cause it was too hard but it was hard deciding to quit too, I wonder if anybody in band misses me, I wonder if any of the guys had secret crushes on me, I hope some of them did, but I guess that's not a good thing to hope considering I have a boyfriend, I really miss my boyfriend a lot, and I just thought about macaroni and cheese for some weird reason, I wonder why I thought of that, maybe cause both me and my boyfriend like macaroni and cheese, I'm such a horrible typist, this typing is probably the worse I've ever done, I only have a couple of minutes left to go, gosh time really went but fast since I was just typing anything I thought, I wonder if the professor will really read this, he is a really cool professor, I like him a lot, but now if he does read this he's probably going to think I was sucking up to him but that's not true cause I really love psychology, that's a hard word to spell, well its not hard but it takes a little time to think about how it's spelled, I remember when I was in the spelling bee in 4th grade, I think it was fourth grade, maybe it was third, I remember my ex best friend who was in my third grade class, I didn't really know her then but now she is really stupid but I don't really want to think about that right now and my twenty minutes is up so I guess I'll stop typing! "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, the twenty minutes start now. It feels strange having to write out what I am thinking. Seeing as how I've never had a diary or journal, I've never had to do this before. Funny how your mind draws a blank when you are supposed to be writing what you are thinking at that very instant. A whole minute has gone by and I can not think of anything to type. I guess that's kind of the purpose. don't think ahead for once, just let everything come out just as quickly as it comes in. all day long, my mind has been jumbled up with. well, stuff, and now I can't seem to remember what all the ""stuff"" was. Gosh, it's early and I'm already tired. It's not that today was stressful, just very hot and tiring. I can't wait until the weather finally cools off. I wish I could sleep in tomorrow. I wish I could go to sleep now. I hope what I actually write isn't important. After all, it's only a completion grade, right? I hope so. Sigh. Now that I'm thinking about it, this class kind of worries me, after 5 class days in here, I'm still not sure what to study or what to write down in my notes, the TA at the supplemental instructions class, I can't remember her name at the moment, says that we should pay attention to the book and the notes. But I think we wanted a more concise answer. My philosophy class is exactly the same. No body knows what to write in their notes, after all, all the notes we take are basically made up of questions. I'm a bit nervous about my first test in that class. And we are only going to have three, and that's counting the final. It has its good and bad points I guess. Double standard. Since I've started college, it seems like everything is a double standard. I don't live on campus that has its good and bad points. Umm, what else? Lots of things. hard to come with them right now. Dang, I still have to read for my writing class. ugh, that book is boring, I hope I don't fall asleep reading it again. More than likely I will seeing as how I'm sleepy right now. I think I should just read tomorrow while I'm on the shuttle to school. That'd be good. Oh, I can't. I have to get on the early bus tomorrow, it's going be too packed to be able to concentrate. Guess I have to read tonight. Oh well. Gosh, I'm tired. Wait. My mom always calls when I'm in the middle of something. Weird. Why did she need my schedule? I bet so she could call when she knows I'm not in class. I know this sounds bad, but I don't want to talk to her everyday. Every time she calls, she sounds like she's upset with me. I think she's mad because I left home. But it's not like I went out of the country, or out of state for that matter. I'm only 3 hours away, and I'm going home this weekend to visit anyway. She doesn't have reason to be upset with me. She's supposed to happy and proud. It was always hard to make her proud. Nothing ever seemed good enough for her. But not my dad, he's different. As long as I tried, my dad was always proud of me; I love him for that. Well, there goes my timer. 20 minutes is up. Thank you. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, after reading the assignment I began to wonder how on earth I could track my thoughts and feelings in my mind. I mean, does the professor want some sort of biological explanation? Because I just got through about half of chapter 2 and the whole neural process. My dendrites are busy sending neurons through my axon every supermillisecond, right? Then again, I'm sure those thought processes do not include all my feelings because I do think a lot. For example, now I am debating whether I should go to dinner or not, but I can't leave in the middle of this assignment so I guess I'm going to wait about 15 more minutes. To track my mind. let's see, most of my thoughts come pretty random (at least they do to everyone around me when I think aloud) and. uh oh, my roommate is talking pretty loud to me, influencing my thought process. Not that I have an attention disorder, it was just a slight distraction  like the music that's playing in my dorm room right now. I wonder how long it would take to read about 500 students' thought processeswould that start to influence your own? For some reason, every time I start hanging around a new crowd of people every few years, I start thinking like them. Is that an aspect of societal/cultural influence, or does it happen to everyone? Thinking is something that occurs all the time. For example, even when I want to stop thinking and go to sleep at night, thoughts just keep wandering in. I guess it usually comes from my visual observations during the day and the little things spark new thoughts that occur either right then or much later in the day. Oh, I just remembered I should probably save this page before anything happens to it  but would that take up time in my writing process? Oh well, only a few more minutes left and then I save. I guess I'm kind of stumped as to what I should keep writing. I'm trying to explain how I think and how much I think, but the words are hard to come by. This happens a lot, though. Whenever I understand something in my head, it's hard to explain it by mouth. Some people have absolutely no problem changing these chemical messages into physical sounds, but I can totally blank on words that I say everyday sometimes. I think pretty fast, though, so maybe the time it takes to transfer from my head to my mouth is just slower? I guess since I'm writing this for a psychology class, psychological thoughts come to my head. I have a whole bunch of questions, and I usually make up my own answers to explain them  but I usually find out my explanations are incorrect. Right now I'm not feeling too well: I have a stomachache and my throat is all dry and scratchy. So, I start assessing why this could be  maybe it's the dirty air here that I've been breathing for a few weeks, maybe it's the water, or could it have come from my roommate who has a cold? But my stomach hurts, too. Is it the dorm food that is causing it? Is it the heat outside that is so unbearable? I wonder if it is from stomach acidity or stress? Nowadays I cannot tell if my bad health occurs from stress or from real factors. Will I ever find a cure to keep myself healthy at all times? Is there any way to be rid of stress? There are so many questions, but probably only one right answer. Who knows that answer? When will I find out? When will these 20 minutes be up? I wonder what other people are writing about. What do you think about through another person's eyes? I think I should stop asking questions and start explaining more about my thoughts and feelings  but aren't my questions an explanation in itself? I think its interesting that psychology covers biology, because wouldn't that mean there is something permanent about your personality in your brain? The question of nature vs. nurture has always interested me. I've always wondered if its both part nature and part nurture that influences the way we think. Does anyone think as much as me? "
Tell me about yourself.,"why in the world do we have to do everything online? I don't have a computer yet PC Mall told me that the one that I wanted would be at least a month because it's backordered. My friend is singing bad German grammar phrases. Megan, Lori, and I just ordered a pizza, and now we're worried that we will get fat. She's still dancing like a complete moron she thinks that she is a hummingbird. I think that I will party hard on Saturday night but not as hard as on last Friday. I got really inebriated and bruised myself in several nondiscreet places. Lori is trying to dictate what I should be writing, but this is my assignment, not hers. Megan smokes crack, and Lori likes to hum really bad show tunes. Lori, please turn the light back on. Melanie just came in wearing an American Outpost shirt. I think that this computer does not like me very much. This Cure song is so wonderful. I'm going to Poly Esther's on Tuesday so that I can shake my groove thing to some quaint 80s tunes. Simple Minds, Jimi Hendrix, Aerosmith, Boston, Culture Club, The GoGos, TheB52sthey're all wonderful! I think that I need to go shopping for some new clothes sometime soon. I should have brought my music down here. Would I wear a black lace skirt with nothing underneath? Probably not, but I wouldn't put it past myself. Megan loves to hump monkeys, and Lori likes to screw donkeys. The pizza man better hurry the hell up I'm starving! This room is really freaking cold (chilly is not cool). The music just got louder, but it's not any better. I don't think that I would look very good in a charcoal gray skirt. Red is definitely my color. My radishes were growing mold, so I threw them out. Old Navy is for high schoolers, Gap is for college kids, and Banana Republic is for the working world. How much longer do I need to type on this damn computer? I would rather write by hand any day. I think my eyes are glazing over from the absurd brightness of the screen. Oohback cramps! My vixen red nail polish is chipping time to redo. random thoughts are running through my head. rings on my fingers but no bells on my toes Megan has a rash on her leg. Big bruise on my thigh. Now I'm just making stuff up. Are my 20 minutes up yet? Guess not. When I start typing randomly, I don't make any sense. Ladybugs everywhere. Ska is fun. Come on Eileen. I'm out of things to talk about now it's all going downhill. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I still feel sleepy because I just got up a few minutes ago. I am wondering if that is a good way to start a stream of consciousness exercise. My computer told me that I misspelled consciousness, but I don't believe it. I have always been a good speller, for years and years and my computer is only a few months old, so what does it know. I lost my geography notes sometime yesterday, so I'm still mad about that since I only found out a little while ago. It makes it tough, especially since the professor said that the class would be split into two parts. The book would cover one set of information, and the lecture would cover another, and I just lost the last two lectures. Oh well. I am thinking that I am thinking too much about what to write, trying not to forget that stream of consciousness is just that. The WP still thinks that I can't spell and I'm becoming irritated because I can't stop writing for twenty minutes to check what the mistake is. I thought someone was in my apartment, but it was just my upstairs neighbors, apparently. It's not any fun having five people and change living right on top of you. I wonder what kind of day it will turn out to be. Hot, probably. I can't wait for the cool weather to come. This oppressive heat makes me not want to go do stuff outside, and I love to do stuff outside. Well, that's not true. It doesn't really make me want to not go outside, it just isn't encouraging. I'm thinking that I've already written a lot for only about 9 minutes. Makes you wonder. I am wishing that I had all the cable channels in my bedroom, since I paid for them. I need a better study ethic. I think that I've been putting in about half the studying that I need to, but I haven't even had any homework or anything to study yet in my math class, so I'm not sure whether I should worry yet. I'm going home this weekend to see my friends and my dad, and I've been thinking about that a lot lately. I feel pressure to stay in contact with people at other school, etc. Maybe after a while, I won't feel that way anymore. I'm sure I won't, just look at my sister. And my brother, they just do their own thing, have their own small groups of friends. I feel I should include my brother. I worry sometimes how I come off, how other people see me. But other times, I couldn't care less how they see me. I think it's justified, I'm not a hypocrite, I just have an idea of myself and how I want to be and be seen and certain things dictate that I make an effort on them, and with other things, if I don't seem to care, then that is how I want to be seen. I realize that my writing is vague, only in ideas and few personal details, but that is what I'm comfortable with. I don't believe in diaries. If I ever did this sort of thing on a regular basis, then I wouldn't ever keep it for someone to find. I would destroy it. Kind of a harsh phrase isn't it. ""Destroy it. "" Like it came from a movie or something. ""Destroy it. "" I'm about to come to the end of my twenty minutes and I think that I've spent too much time correcting typos. Not that I make a lot of typos, but when I do, I always go back and fix them before I go on with my writing. I'm feeling sleepy again and I think I'll go make some coffee. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I don't like IceBreaker's gum because the flavor crystals sometimes don't break down in your mouth, and the texture is just plain disturbing. I won a huge pack of IceBreaker's gum from Pro Grad and I now feel obligated to make use of it even though I dislike it. I do that a lot. I eat foods that I don't really like just to make my mom happy. It is not really a big deal. I usually tell people what I like and what I dislike, but sometimes I don't. My grandma uses coconut in her sweets, and I don't like coconut, but I use to eat it anyway. One day I just stopped and she didn't really notice. I was like, ""Man I could have stopped a long time ago, but instead I didn't. "" Okay that makes no sense, but I do not always make sense. My mind jumps from thing to thing, and I digress a lot. I get off track often. Love is a funny thing; it is so hard to really say what it is. To me love is about small things that people don't really notice, but those in love do. I cannot really give an example; but then again that could be because my mind is not really focused on this topic. I can get deep and all emotional when I feel the moment calls for it, but right now I am just not really in a ""deep"" mood. I still have to read my Chemistry and read my Cyberreader for my Cyberpunk class. Why am I taking a Cyberpunk class? I have no idea. I like to try and experience new things so I decided to take it. Actually, it was the only one that fit into my schedule and had a writing component that accompanied it. Ummm eleven more minutes to go. what to say. I love to be happy. I hate to be sick. I love to go swimming or to stay in the shower for really long periods of time when I am sick. The water just seems to clear up and free my nasal passages. I don't want to do my reading assignments. I want to just go for a walk or go out with my boyfriend. I want to go see ""The Cell"" with Jennifer Lopez and Vince Vaughn. I can be such a teenager sometimes. I do some of the most immature and silly things. I can fall all over myself when I see a cute boy band, and I can gush over how wonderful it would be to be a superstar and have a superstar boyfriend. Clay Walker, a country singer, has a song called ""Ordinary People"". It is about how ordinary people have extraordinary love. It talks about how when superstars breakup, and how when they do breakup up that they probably wish they could be ordinary. The great thing about not being a superstar is having your privacy. I can't imagine being photographed all the time. I don't look good in photos when I am posing, so you can only imagine how awful I would look in ones where I do not pose. I sit here writing this and try to think of what you all will think when you read it. You all will see the section about me not liking to be photos and then draw from that that I have selfconfidence issues. I can sit on a dorm chair and swing my feet. I like being short. I like that people view me as cute just because I am short. Being short is good if you are a girl because it would suck it your crush was shorter than you. I just like the idea of the guy being tall. My boyfriend is six feet tall, and that makes us look cuter because I look so cute and little next to him, and for some reason I think that makes us look cuter. Why do they call the prestage room the green room? The green room is often not even green. I don't understand that. I don't understand a lot of things like why the sky is blue, and why the grass is green. Except of course for in way west Texas where there is no grass and if there is it is yellow and tan. I hate people who are hypocrites. I think that you should stand up for what you believe in, and if you don't know what to believe in then don't stand up on your soapbox going in circles. I wish I was smarter. I wish I could sing. that would be a great talent just because I like to sing. Two minutes to go! I can't help but look at the clock. I am the type of person who has to thumb through the pages of my reading assignment and see how many more pages I have to read. I am very impatient, but I am patient when I feel it is necessary. Times Out! The End! "
Tell me about yourself.,"College presents a life that is quite different from home life! Having to adjust the many changes is both challenging and fun! Doing laundry is a task that I am almost positive that I will never become accustomed to! It is boring and time consuming! When I visit home I appreciate the clean clothes in my closet even more, since they are clean and I wasn't the one to clean them! However, the independence I now have is unexplainable. I realize that I am in control of my life now and the direction I will go! Sure I had control of my life before college, but my parents were there to guide me and make sure I made the right decision. Now it's all up to me to make the right choices. I have to be the one to say, ""I don't want to go out tonight. "" And when my friends persist, I can't use the excuse, my parents won't let me, which makes it even more difficult! I know college will present me with as many challenges to overcome as well as fun memories that I will cherish forever. I am excited about my next four years here and am quite sure that with my determination and hard work, I will succeed not only at The University of Texas, but in life as well!  "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, hello. I am really not sure what to write about, I guess I can start with my day. You see, I am a commuter. I live in Bastrop. No one in Austin seems to know where that is but it is a little town on the other side of the airport. So, anyway, that means that I have the privilege of driving through morning traffic for an hour just to get to class, then what is even worse it that I get to drive back home through five o'clock traffic. It is a pain in the backside. I hate Austin Drivers. On the up side, I was lucky enough to schedule all 15 hours on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. That helps because I am also a Parttime employee with fulltime hours at the only department store in Bastrop. Three years ago the store opened meaning that Bastrop now had a WalMart, HEB, and Bealls. That is about it for stores. So, about my job, I am a Sales Associate. We recently switched new districts into the Austin area. The District Manager is very strict on how the store is arranged. Last week, whoever did the schedule only scheduled me to work on Saturday for Five hours. You can not pay bills working at a minimum wage job for five hours a week. So I told my Store Manager that I would be more than happy to come in if she needed any help prior to Annette (the District manager) coming in on that Friday. In the end I worked ten days in a row, pulling in forty hours before Friday when the District Manager was going to be in to audit. I was exhausted by the time Sunday rolled around. I was thankful that my Manager let me have Sunday off, I needed the rest. Today is my anniversary, I have been dating a guy for eight months now. This is probably of no concern to you but I am very proud of that fact. He goes to Incarnate Word in San Antonio. He is an Eagle Scout and spends all summer teaching camp at Lost Pines Boy Scout Reservation. On weekends, he comes back to Bastrop to ref. Soccer games at the BYSO Soccer fields. All this volunteering helped him when it came to my parents approval. You know, one time in my Drama Class, a friend of mine started to do just a stream of consciousness monologue. In the end he was talking about mixed drinks and jelly beans, it was very funny. I miss my Drama Class. Most of my high school stuff I had to give up due to the need to be able to afford college and get my degree. I had to quit dancing, I had danced for 13 years at a local studio. Then I had to give up Color Guard, an organization that I was the captain of for all four years of High school. Most upsetting though was giving up Drama. If I was not in a play I always tried to contribute somehow. I single handedly costumed four productions in one year in my ""spare time"". Oh well, I guess that is it for mow. "
Tell me about yourself.,"This morning I was late for my calculus discussion class. I was trying to catch up on reading last night and thought I could finish it all at once. I was wrong. I read most of it and finished the rest this afternoon. The stuff I read last night while I was half awake didn't stay in my head. I glanced over those sections this morning, but I don't remember most of it. I think I need to divide my time more wisely because I don't think I will retain anything this way. Since I didn't get enough sleep last night, I tried to take a nap around 2:00 after I got back from my biology discussion. I couldn't fall asleep so I thought I would read Chicken Soup for the College Soul, a book one of my cousins gave me for graduation. I read a funny story about how this one student took intro to psychology and fed his family back home all the new info he learned. He would relate what he learned in class to the simplest situations that happened at home. His parents were a little bit annoyed, but he was trying to apply his learning to everyday life. I liked how it happened to be about what I was studying. Anyway, after that, I shut my eyes and tried to sleep. I don't think I was actually asleep, but I feel less tired now. I guess that was the point of my socalled nap. My brother calls them power naps, but I could never understand that until now. When I was younger, I could fall asleep at any time and still go to bed on time. That has changed. If I sleep during the day, I can't fall asleep as easily at night. I think my nap today wasn't long enough for me to be awake tonight to study, but I'll find that out later. I am going to read some more chemistry and biology. I can't wait. Right now, we are learning the basics, and it's so boring. It's the stuff the teachers in high school just skimmed over because it wasn't as important as other things we needed to learn. Even though my classes used to be an hour and a half in high school, my classes now seem longer. It's odd that I keep looking at my watch. Classes are only fifty minutes, and it feels like forever. Some of my teachers drag on, and it's hard to focused, especially with no sleep. My chemistry teacher stopped in the middle of her lecture to wake someone up. She said that she wouldn't sleep in a cold, uncomfortable auditorium. She would rather sleep in her bed, with a pillow and blanket. She would rather be nice and snug at home. She wanted to know why students choose to come to class and sleep. The professor told the guy to go home and sleep. She wasn't trying to be rude, just telling him what she thought about how comfortable a auditorium was to sleep in. She said that we didn't need to come to class any other day but quiz day so that guy could sleep all he wanted, at home. It was so hilarious. I am sitting here thinking about how many different things I have talked about in about twenty minutes. I changed topics so many times, and this is probably how I talk to people also. I didn't exactly focus on one topic. What I started writing about led to something else, and now I have ended up on a completely different idea. "
Tell me about yourself.,"So, write for twenty minutes that should be easy enough. The concert last night was great I have never seen anyone play like that especially for that length of time. I mean goodness they played for three and a half hours. Victor is great I would have put incredible but I don't know how to spell it. I am kind of glad that I get to go home today. I mean I like Austin and all, but it's good to get home every once and a while. I'm also glad that Brandon got to come down for a couple of days, He was probably pretty glad to get out of Dallas for a while I can't believe this word processor doesn't have the word Dallas programmed in the spell checker. Some people. At least the ones responsible for the computers that is. Oh well. I wonder what everyone else is writing. I imagine that this could turn into some sort of confessional for some people. Weird. Read any good books? I haven't lately only newspapers and those don't count. I am excited about going to Berkeley next year. Not Berkley California, Berkeley Boston. Lots of good musicians there. Of course there are lots of good musicians here too, just of a different kind of breed everything here is about the blues while in the Northeast people look at things a little differently. Commercials on TV suck. I don't understand the ones that come on during prime time and then they say absolutely nothing about what it is they are selling or any relevant information about the products. Create interest nothing. creates confusion. Do theses people honestly think that the majority of Americans even give a shit about commercials much less THEIR product. Besides most of them are about disgusting stuff in the first place. Women's hygiene ads and balding men paraphernalia. Who cares people with those kind of problems would obviously know that they had a problem and most of them are seeking a solution so it seems to me that if you just shut up and spent your ad money making the best product on the market then people would buy it because it was the best. Not because Barbra on TV said that eight out of ten doctors seem to think that somewhere sometime this product might be exactly what you might be looking for. Well my time is done so I guess this is the end "
Tell me about yourself.,"As the past couple of weeks have flown by, I have been stressed about my work load. Like probably most college students I have the urge to wait for the last minute before starting any assignments. So far and usually I am always able to get my work done on time, however if I would only start the assignments a little earlier I would not have as much stress as I do now. Also after recently reading the first chapter of my psychology book I am wondering if the cause of my illness is to due to excessive stress. On Tuesday I started to have a runny nose which later progressed into a sore throat. I usually do not fall victim to illness very easily so I am almost sure that stress is playing a large part in it. At my house in Irving I had gotten use to having my friends and family all within a five minute drive. Now that I have moved to Austin and been separated from home for an extended period of time, I occasionally find it hard to balance my time. With the options of sleep, tv, eating, homework, video games, or just hanging out with my friends, it is hard to make a decision on both what I want to do and what I need to do. On the up side of things I feel like I am slowly becoming accustomed to my new life here in Austin. I have started to develop a study pattern and my urge and will to do work on time and efficiently has increased. Over the fall and spring semester my ultimate goal is to have a high enough grade point average to transfer into the business school. If that transfer is successful it will only give me more motivation to try harder and be a better student. That is certainly the goal of me being a college student to begin with. I am looking forward to continuing my hard work and hope to enjoy the benefits at the end of the year. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I really don't know the first thing to say in this paper. I know I was confused about what to do, but there is really no confusion to it. is there? I don't know why I am talking to the computer like it is really going to talk back to me. Well, what am I thinking. I first want to know why it is so darn cold in all of these buildings, like I am about to freeze now in the computer lab at Kinsolving, and my roommate is talking to me about her boyfriend coming to see her today. Hell, I hate men right about now, because my man and I broke up a few weeks ago, before I came to school because he can't handle being in a serious relationship, that just happens to be long distance. I just don't know what the problem is. I mean if I am capable of being faithful, which has come pretty hard for me in the past, then I can be in a committed relationship. God, I need to get these nails off of my fingers because I keep messing up and having to backspace all the time. I think I'll get them soaked off tomorrow, after I get my navel pierced. I must seem like a really superficial person considering some of the things that are running through my mind. My fingers are starting to hurt because I am having to work extra hard because I have on these freaking nails. I just saw the number one in the tower on the computer screen that this boy just showed me. He looked so young, and he was actually kind of cute, but not tall enough. I know I just said that I hate men, but that was a lie. I can't live without them. Especially the tall ones that play basketball or run track or something. God, I want a man! I wonder how I would sound of I started talking all philosophical and stuff. I am not the type to go into deep analytical thinking, and I bet you are say, then why are you in my class. I think that the you are cool. I mean Prof. Pennebaker seems to be cool, but anyway. I am so bored right now, I have to braid this dude's hair, and I kind of don't want to, but he's going to pay me and I need some money, soon, and there is some back to school thing in the business atrium tonight. I guess I will go for a little while, not too long because I have a class at 930 in the morning, and it just happens to be calculus, and my damn teacher can't even speak english all the way. Why would the math department of all departments have teachers that students can't understand? I don't freaking get it. It's one of the hardest subjects at this school, and someone that is a first year teacher and can't speak english is teaching the class. WHY? Are the powers that be trying to torture me? Well, whatever happens, I will stay prayed up and depend on the lord to help me through this tough class. I just thought about something, I am not going to be able to go home this weekend because my parents are going to Oklahoma for Labor Day to visit my auntie Bev, and my Uncle Lawrence. I wonder how Precious is doing. I hope she still isn't messing with that idiot Kevin, like I think she still is. when will she ever learn, men that pray on you, and want all of your money, and wreck your car are not good boyfriend material. I mean, I know that I have had some trouble in the past dealing with idiot men, but I learned my lesson. I want to find me someone to act right and help me along the way when I need it. Is that too much to ask for? Gee, I can go on and on about men, and the experience s that I have had with them, but that is old and I am in a new place, and have to meet new men, and make new friends and most of all make awesome grades so that I can be on the dean's list like I want to be, and make the cheerleading team this year is going to prove to be a great one, and I hope that the lord blesses me do do well in all that I do this year and my years to come. I know that I am capable of doing it all, but I just want to survive. This city is filled with opportunity, and it's all mine for the taking!  "
Tell me about yourself.,"Writing this paper on Friday is extremely irritating for me. I know that I was given plenty of time beforehand, but being the procrastinator that I am I waited until the last minute. This annoys me because I usually do this on most of my assignments. I have a feeling of regret that I didn't do it beforehand. It is hard for me to concentrate seeing that after I am done writing this assignment I am going to go back home to visit some of my friends I haven't seen in awhile. This gives me a good feeling. It is almost a feeling of relaxation and anticipation all in one. Tonight I am also going to go to a football game in my hometown. Thinking about watching a football game gives me a rush. I get flash backs of my quarterback going through the snap count, my heart pounding with anticipation and anxiety as I am about to get the ball, the snap, and a huge burst of adrenaline as I get the ball. Thinking back through each step  I can feel the emotion that was accompanied each step, only at a lower level. I am also extremely tired having stayed up way to late last night. This is probably why I am finding trouble concentrating and being consistent with certain ideas. I also feel confused because I really think that this isn't what the professor wanted, but too bad. "
Tell me about yourself.,"As I walk down the middle of campus with thousands of people rushing by me on their way to class, I feel like a star in the huge night sky. With so many stars scattered throughout the sky, I seem to go unnoticed and lost. This is a feeling that I have seldom felt. As an allstar volleyball player, the student council vice president, and the homecoming queen I have always been one of the brightest stars. Just a month ago, I seemed to have my entire world in order and what seemed to me perfection. I now feel lonely and intimidated as I embark on this new phase in my life. I feel like I no longer have control, and perfection seems harder to achieve than ever. Knowing that if I do not obtain a B in Chemistry 313, my dreams of becoming a nurse are next to impossible. Can my life long dreams honestly be shattered by one college course? As I search for answers, I question whether or not I made the right decision to choose to attend the University of Texas, or if I'm even college material at all. What am I saying? Going to college was never an option for me. I want a good life for my family and I, and I've always dreamed of becoming a nurse and helping those who need me. My parents have always taught me to do my best and work towards my dreams, but words are often easier said than done. However, I could not have made it through my first week at the university if not for the love and support I have received from my family. Throughout my life, I would probably have to credit at least fifty percent of my accomplishments to my family, because they are my strong hold. Though I regard them so highly, I also feel that in this instance they are somewhat of my downfall. The transition to college would not be such a struggle for me if my ties to my family and friends that I have left behind were not so great. It is incredibly hard for me to accept change, because I accept my surroundings and others and become comfortable with them and do not want to leave my comfort zone. I feel that this is somewhat peculiar because I realize that even if I was to remain the same, with the same friends and circumstances, the world and people around me would continue to change and grow and expand. Eventually I would be left behind. As I work to achieve and to be the best I can be, I hope that along the way I will find the happy, positive person that I once was and know I still am. "
Tell me about yourself.,"My goodness. I have so much to do over the next few daysnot to mention the next semester. Wow, my first semester in college. I love this freedom. I want to go to sleep. I feel like I'm completely wasting the time and the freedom I have by sleeping through it all. My roommate is at a Delta Gamma function right now. I'm in the sorority. I really should be there. I guess I'm a party pooper. She pissed me off a few hours ago. I really liked her, but I'm beginning to get some weird vibes from her. Someone was caught smoking weed on our floor in our dorm tonight, and the resident assistant went to talk to him about it. My roommate got really mad about it. She said, ""That's so dumb. That's why those people wanted to live off campus. The RA said he was going to be lenient on that kind of thing, and now he's getting them in trouble just because someone ratted them out. "" Oh well. oh God. I have to go deal with some feminine hygiene issues. Okay, I'm back. Anyway. I don't care where you live. That's still completely illegal, and people shouldn't be doing that. She was just so blas about it. I don't drink, and I don't exactly condone that either, but smoking pot is so much worse. If people are going to do illegal things, then that really sucks. But if they're not hurting anyone besides themselves, then whatever. If that's the case, then let them do their own thing. But they absolutely do not have the right to feel victimized if they get caught. That's so immature and irresponsible. I'm listening to Canon by Pachelbel right now. Wait. I have to check the spelling on ""Pachelbel. "" Yay. I was right. I figured I would be. not to sound cocky or anything. I just like when things are spelled correctly. oh. I have to press ""repeat. "" I really like this song a lot. I'm getting more and more into this classical music thing. My parents, or my mom really. my dad's not really concerned with me very much. my mom raised me to be pretty cultured. I love music and the arts. So anyway. I love this song. The string quartet played it as the wedding march at my mom and my stepdad's wedding when I was only eight years old. I was the maid of honor. Goofy. This song reminds me of one of the instrumental pieces from the little mermaid. the part in the movie where Prince Eric is escorting the human Ariel around his town. The instrumental piece is playing when they are dancing in a little square and he lifts her up just as the music climaxes. Oh. it's so beautiful. That part always gives me the chills. That sounds so dorky. I think it's just the combination of the beautiful music and the thought that Eric and Ariel are falling in love. Hold on. got to press ""repeat"" again. Sometimes this laptop really makes me mad and frustrated. The keys are so small and close together that I press the wrong one a lot. It's really annoying. I miss California. I used to live there. I feel sick. I'm also coughing because of a guy that lives down my hall. He was smoking earlier, and I was in the same room. On top of that, I've had a cold for the past four days. I'm all stuffed up, and I have to blow my nose again. I switched to another classical cd. I especially like some of the pieces on this cd. Right now, Tchaikovsky's (yes, I did look at the cd to see how to spell that) ""Piano Concerto in B flat minor"" is playing. I really wish I knew what ""in B flat minor"" means. Ok. my ""stream of consciousness"" was interrupted. I feel really bad. My hallmate called me and I've been down in her room for the past 45 minutes. Oh. I just walked back into the room and ""The Waltz of the Flowers"" from the Nutcracker is playing on my ""100 Masterpieces of Classical Music"" cd. This is such an amazing song. I miss taking ballet classes. I really need to get back into it. I'm so out of shape. I have this yucky flab on my thighs. And I really just miss the discipline and the beauty of dancing. I'm sick of all of the superficial drill team dancing that I've been doing for the past three years. It's all for show. I want to go back to taking classes where I can dance for the sake of dancing, where I can appreciate the beauty of it, where I can allow my emotions and my compassion to bring feeling into my movements. I guess I'm weird. I just get these really amazing feelings sometimes, especially when I'm listening to music or when I'm dancing. I just have these moments where I get Goosebumps and I'm so overcome by the feelings of the music. I really miss California a lot. And I'm still coughing because of that guy that was smoking. My throat hurts. I just remembered that someone the other day asked me how to spell ""throat. "" That kind of thing really scares me. I mean. We're in college, and someone doesn't know how to spell a simple word. I really hate it when people spell things incorrectly or use poor grammar or punctuation. It just really pisses me off. That's so analretentive of me, but it just really makes me mad. Okay. I have to do my homework for my linguistics class now. I must say that I had a really interesting time typing this assignment. I've never done anything like this before. I think it has convinced me that I need to start keeping a journal of my thoughts. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I don't feel like going to class today, but because I paid a great amount of money for this education I might as well. But wait, it's a discussion class for Calculus, oh well, it's not like I understood anything what Dr. Friedman was saying yesterday in class. Do I really have to walk all the way over there? If I don't go, I can spend some of that time studying for a chemistry test tomorrow, as well as download some more songs off the Internet. The chemistry test is my first test and I don't how Dr. Brodbelt makes her tests. But because it's over the first two chapters, which were basically a review of chemistry in High School, hopefully, it might be easy. I sure hope so! Ahhh. school, it's getting on my nerves. Let this week calm down, it'll be okay next week. I can't wait until the weekend. On my gosh, I have 30 minutes until my next class, what should I do? Sleep, nahh. what if I oversleep, that would be bad. I guess I should start packing my books and looking for my keys to lock the room, which by the way, I really don't understand why the lock on the door opens when you turn the key to the left, and locks when you turn the key to the right. Shouldn't it be the other way around? Oh well, why am I making such a big deal about it, it provides me the security of my place. I should be thankful. Anyhow, I need to get to class. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I have lots of things to today. I need to read and take note for all my classes. The bird is really getting on my nerves. I hope I will be able to finish all of my homework in time. If I write my paper at home I can print it at my sister's house, but I would have to finish it before I go home because I do not want to do it this weekend. I would ask someone to print it for me but I do not have enough time to go in the morning. I wonder what the psychology test is going to be like. I can't wait to go home. I miss my nephew so much and he is growing so fast. I miss my mom and dad. I hope my dad is o. k. The doctors can't do anything anymore and I am very worried about him. I do not have to do laundry today and the apartment is going to quiet if I do not put the television on. I am going to try to work all day without the television. Once as I turn it on it will never be turned off and I need to study. I really enjoy my days off. Too bad this is the last time I get to sleep late and not have to go anywhere. I would not be able to go anywhere since I do not have a car and I can't drive a standard. I want my own car, a VW Bug that is midnight blue. My aunt has one and it is so big and has lots of space. It is the perfect car for me because I do not like huge cars. Big cars seem to take control over you and I like to be able to control the car. I also want it to be an automatic because I do not know how to drive a stick shift. It would also be so much easier with an automatic. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Today I woke up to the sun sinning in to the room and it gave me much joy. the warm sun rays lighting up the room starts a day off very nicely. sweetie now that made me feel all warm and fussy in side. I just had to sit back and take it in for a few moments before closing the chat window. she called me sweetie, Wow! I hope she knows that made me feel special. I hope I make her feel special. because she is special to me. JoAnna what a unique name. It is a lovely name. one with two capital letters. laptops, this is so cool I am typing on a laptop, I wish I could have my own. maybe I could save some money some how. I wonder if my mom will give me some for it. hmmm. must likely not. my sis is doing better. she needs to eat more healthy. this summer was a great summer. God really blessed me. I worked a lot help on the house met one great family and to great friends in it. I got all the classes I wanted to switch in to these fall. so awesome. God is awesome. I am so bless through his love. I pray I make the most of it and continue be focused. I have so much time and yet I always want things faster. I seem to want it now. but time and patients will help me through. Sweetie wow I just can't get over it. I am so lucky to have some like that in my life. just to look at her brings me joy. and those eyes. I love getting lost in those eyes. what if I didn't say anything? will she turn away? will she be embarrassed? I hope not. does she feel the same way? If she does is this the one? or maybe it is another I have not met. I wish I knew. I have to be patient. all good things come in time. I wonder if she knows that I wonder what she is doing sometimes. does she do the same? when can I see her again. when is too soon to talk to her. what is to much? who knows! her smile is so beautiful. no wonder I am so at tracked to her. the smile is the first things I notice in a girl. and my mom likes her too, what are the odds. something must be right. maybe I thinking too far ahead. all I now is I like it. I like JoAnna and she likes me. That is what I know. I know I want to see more of her but that will have to go slow because school is why I am here in Austin. maybe over Christmas we can see more of each other. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Goodness gracious! I am so tired of returning to this page that I absolutely don't know what else to write about nor say except for HELP! This is like my fourth time trying to complete this assignment and I am so tired of it but it is to late to complain now so I might as well shut up and continue on writing or shall I say typing. It looks again like I will be going to bed after midnight, I hope not but I do have a lot of assignments that I still need to complete. My most important assignment will be to get organized because going at this rate I will have a hell of a freshman year just trying to keep up. I am doing a little better now with following my syllabus but I still have a long way to go. Maybe when I get a job I will learn how to manage my time more wisely and I will be able to develop better study skills. My fiance' tells me that I have good study skills I just worry to much and stress myself out over small unimportant things that have nothing to do with my classes or myself. To be honest, I do believe that I do get stressed out over every little thing but I think that I am getting a lot better at handling different situations, like this one. My biggest problem is that I really miss him and it is so hard being here in Austin all alone while he is in North Carolina. Hopefully after this year we will be able to come up with a compromise and a solution to all of our problems and concerns. I miss him and I am really looking forward into seeing him in a couple of months. Well, my time is about up and I really need to go so that I can begin to tackle my other UT coursework. I have to make my grades so that they won't make me. "
Tell me about yourself.,"For some reason I am very tired. Ever since I have been up here I always feel tired. Some days I don't do very much so it does not make sense for me to be very tired. I also get very bored sometimes. I can think of absolutely nothing to do. I wish I had my computer so I could save this so later I can see what I wrote. I thought I would be doing more and going more places when I got up here. My friends that I am always with up here are not very active and exciting. I miss my best friend a lot. I don't miss home, just the people there. I also miss my very, very good friend who goes to school in Indiana. I miss him so much. I think about him all of the time. I miss him more and more each day. He is just my friend, so I don't know what is wrong with me. We became a little closer over the summer. Some people that I know think that we should date. I don't know. I think I might like him, but I sometimes feel that I shouldn't. I don't know. I miss him so much. I worry about him all the time. I also worry about my brother and my sister very much. Hopefully, I will get to visit Justin in Indiana for Thanksgiving. However, he might come home. I really hope that he does come home. If I go up there I will get to see real snow. I like it up there very much. I don't know why. I have been twice. I really like his friends up there. They are great guys. We have lots of fun together. All the guys who go to his school are gentlemen. I have told myself that if I don't like it here this year that I will transfer next year. But, I love it here, even though I get bored sometimes. I love Texas. Justin hates it for some reason. He thinks I should transfer to a college near Indiana. I have thought about it. The only thing is that I like it here. If something goes wrong I might transfer. I would love to be closer to him, but anything I have ever done for a guy has turned out bad. One should only do things for oneself and one should only listen to their own heart. I'm not sure what my heart is telling me to do, yet. See, I need to quit thinking about him so much and concentrate more on school and studying. This is what I came to college for. To study and learn, not in search of a relationship. I need to remember to go to Mezes and sign up for experiments. I wish we didn't have to do that, but it is much better than writing a 5 page paper. I have never been able to write research papers well. I can write stories and essays well. Oh! I just finished the best book ever. It is Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. I love it so much. I think Jane Austen is my new favorite author. I am now reading Emma by Jane Austen. It seems like it will be a great book, also. I think 20 minutes are over. It sure did go by rather quickly. Bye! "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm sitting in a library waiting for my chemistry class to start and I just thought of a comment placed on the psychology bulletin board that referred to how people see light and if it is different from person to person. If you think about it, the only way we have to reference a color is by what we have been taught what it is. If I see green for what you see as red, how would we know the difference? This desk is sure filled with a lot of profanities, but not as much as the bathroom on my floor of Jester West. Oh, isn't it fun to live in a dorm, my roommate never sleeps, does homework, but he does eat, all the time, including my food from the fridge. The best part of the dorm was getting kicked out at 8 AM so they could install a fire sprinkler system, this building is a lot older than me, why did they wait this long to put in sprinkler systems? Did they do some sort of statistical analysis to determine it is about time for a fire, that it pretty scary. Wow, I've only been typing for ten minutes, this is going to be pretty long. Lets talk about something. Like. well I don't know, hey, it sure was hot last week. I've lives in Texas all my life, but that was still pretty hot, for September. I lived in San Antonio and saw snow once in my life, that was when I was six or so and people say it sometimes snows in Austin, I am starting to find that hard to believe. It's weird living in a smaller city, when I have to drive across town, you think this will take a hour, but it only takes about 20 minutes. The guy next to me keeps looking at me, it's starting to freak me out. I never knew I could put so many commas in a single sentence, the grammar checker in Word in putting little squiggly green lines all across the screen, hey it kind of' looks like my rhetoric paper's first draft, and the second. I don't like that class, why oh why do we have to take it? Well my 20 minutes it about up and I need to start heading to my chemistry class with a teacher that doesn't speak English very well, but it not hard to understand him, well at least I stay awake while tiring to decipher him. "
Tell me about yourself.,"My first week here at UT, I went through rush. I was kind of pressured into it by family and friends, but I also wanted to meet people. After a week of being fake and smiling a whole lot, I was invited into a sorority. I'm not the type of girl that loves having a ton of girlfriends, doing hair and make up, and talking about boys. I personally like to keep most of my feelings to myself and doing my own hair (which includes washing it only). I'm not into curling irons or the right eyeliner. Those things just really don't concern me. That is what I thought sorority girls were like. Some of them are girly girls, but I found a few to click with. I'm still not really sure about the whole Greek life thing, but I'm going to try it for a while. The part I really don't like is the whole politics of the whole thing. It is very harsh and costs a lot of money. But, like I said, I'm going to try it. Nothing about college has really surprised me yet, and I haven't really been that homesick, which is a very good thing. I do miss my pets back home and my best friend, but the people here are all so nice and friendly that it makes it a lot easier. I am a little nervous about some of my classes but hopefully that will die down after the first test. I was thrilled when I realized my roommate was normal and the fact that we get along so well. Right now I think I need to focus on getting more sleep and not getting sick. I know I have plenty of time to go out and have fun and I need to learn to study. My parents keep on stressing to me how important it is to go to class and I know that and I haven't missed a class yet and don't plan on it. I want to do well but have fun at the same time. I don't really know what else. The Emmy's are on right now and I really want to watch them. I'm obsessed with tv and movies. I seriously think I watch a movie a day and I guess that is good because RTF is my major. I have a really cute picture of my best friend and I sitting on my desk right now and looking at it is making me want to call her, which I think I will do now. "
Tell me about yourself.,"i think that the only reason college is as hard as everyone says it is is because they do not want to look dumb in front of other people. I came here thinking that I was in for it but all my classes seem not too difficult with a little bit of reading and work, but then again when people ask me how it is I can pretty much, no clearly see myself saying it is really hard you are in for it. I hate how, no I like the fact that my brother knows a million people no really by a million I mean a million but a cannot stand the fact that when I meet them for some reason after I am introduced by my name and then a relation of his people do this kind of weird double take and say oh YOU are his sister as if they have or had heard many of incidents and or events involving me it makes me a little uncomfortable more so with the males than the females though sometimes I think that the whole world does in fact revolve around the way people look (although when asked the whole world denies it) as if they do not judge or insinuate on the appearance of others I wonder what people think of me I have been told many of times that I fit the idealistic look of that of a rich snob, almost brat like appearance which is then reversed though my personality I would have never thought people would think of stuff like that about me I am highly, no I would say extremely satisfied with myself appearance, social class, and moralistic views though in the least conceited manner possible I do not understand sometimes the way males think though  especially after a few or more drinks I cannot wait until I can buy my elephant a real live circus if you will in my own back yard I am starting to think though that I might have to settle for an elephant shaped pool instead I have never really believed in love at first sight or that someone was ""made"" or ""meant to be"" for you you just find someone you can make it work with otherwise why do so many people get divorced and remarried multiple times before or ever finding the right person it irritates me that people think that you are interested in them in a relationship type of manner when you simply look at them, I look at everybody if the door opens I turn around and see who walked in I highly dislike immature people and seem not to understand why certain people are the way that they are I mean I know experiences and relationships have shaped their past but I have many faults in my past and have dealt with or lived with the one person I actually can say I hate I am the least bit negative though and am equally open to everyone that is introduced to my knowledge I like being open minded it enables people as well as myself to look at views and people in an entirely almost inhuman perspective I recently also noticed that nothing really stresses me out or makes me scared or nervous I never stress out why bother stressing about it which also wastes valuable time when the time can be using in a calm cool manner completing the task I just as similarly cannot think of anything that makes me nervous or scared I do not have a problem talking to extremely large audiences nor am I afraid of death I do not understand why people pass out bibles on campus either although I am not christian I went to a catholic school which helped me learn to respect other religions as well as traditions and practices so I cannot throw the bible away and I do not want to leave it anywhere because it is the word of someone else's supreme being "
Tell me about yourself.,"As I sit in front of my computer, trying to put my thoughts into words all I can think about is how tired I am. I am unable to concentrate on any given task that is related to school. All I see in the corner of my eye, is my roommate trying on my favorite black dress. I can't help but laugh, because she just got the sudden urge to try on my clothes. I feel distracted in many ways, because while I am trying to write this psychology paper my friends keep coming in and out of my room. This makes me feel that I am missing out, and I want to join in on the fun. I am also feeling very excited, because tomorrow is finally Friday and I get to see my best friend from high school. She goes to A&M, and it will be interesting to see how life is in Aggieland. This week was stressful and I am ready for a break. I find this assignment quite hard for many reasons. I am not comfortable with expressing my feelings or thoughts to a stranger. I also find this paper difficult because I have so many random thoughts running through my head and I don't want to sound ignorant. For instance, right now I am wondering why our neighbors constantly blare their music. It is very annoying, and is hard to concentrate. Right now the phone is ringing, and I am yet again distracted. I wonder who is on the other end and I am disappointed to find out that the call is not for me. It is hard being a freshman at a huge university such as UT but it makes it a hundred times better because I am rooming with one of my best friends from high school. Right now I am thinking about how much laundry we have left to do. Not fun! I have been writing my thoughts now for about 20 minutes, and I feel as though I wrote probably the most boring paper ever but those were my thoughts that crossed my mind!  "
Tell me about yourself.,"this is now the third time I am writing this paper and I am honestly pretty sick of it. the first time I wrote this, I hit a delete button and erased my entire paper. the second time, the system went down so I couldn't submit my writing. hopefully this time everything will go as planned. I don't really pay much attention usually to how thoughts enter my mind but I think I know generally how my mind works. as long as there is nothing around me stimulating my thoughts I generally think about my insecurities (I am always thinking about how things could be different if say, I were prettier, or smarter, or more outgoing, or whatever), singing a song in my head (whether it be from the radio or a commercial), or stressing myself out over a test or something. if I do see something, like a young couple walking a dog in a park for example, I first take the event for what it is. t might think to myself ""oh what a cute couple"" or ""that is a cute dog. "" as the event passes though, I tend to relate whatever I just saw to me personally. I would probably think to myself, ""I want to get a dog once I get my own apartment. "" my thoughts would quickly digress as I would think of other things I could do with my own place. I would imagine decorating the walls, planting a garden, or even in what part of the city I would want my place to be in. my point is that my thoughts rarely stay on one subject matter. I quickly move from one thing to another, forgetting about whatever it was that I was just thinking about. thoughts simply lead to other thoughts, with one small detail changing the mind track completely. "
Tell me about yourself.,"There are many things that have been bothering me lately. I feel as if I have been betrayed by those that should be absolutely loyal. It is sad that people must always interfere in the things that make you happy. It is as if other people sense when you are content and are trying to steal your happiness out from under you. I have made many new friends that I know will be there for me for many years to come. I feel as if I am part of a sacred family that always supports and protects those that it calls its own. Well, that family has just been defiled by the actions of one. Even though I am not perfect myself, by any means, I always try to do my best when it comes to keeping promises. I am afraid to see what may come of this action. The consequences could be severe indeed if we are found to be guilty of this false accusation. I do not understand what could possess another person to want to place his family in jeopardy just for the sake of conversation. I am deeply saddened by this recent turn of events and I hope and pray that everything will work itself out and that my family will survive and be able to grow into the future. I am prepared to accept the consequences of the actions of my brothers; that is what makes us a family. We have already grown beyond the notion of selfishness and are prepared to assist our family members in any situation, even if it means that we will suffer greatly for actions that were not ours to commit. This new family means the world to me. After leaving my home I felt alone and afraid until I found a group of friends so loyal and so trustworthy that I immediately felt at home again. I will do anything to see that my new family is not harmed or defiled in any way. I believe that it is necessary to have a strong support group to succeed, not only as a student, but as a human being. I am prepared to lay down my selfish tendencies for the good of my family. It is the least I can do. I love my new family as much as my old family. I refuse to see it be destroyed. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I've decided to write this stream of consciousness paper on laptop going home to Houston. My brother was doing the driving so I decided to use my time wisely and write. Right now I feel relaxed going home. I still call Houston my home, although for the second year in a row I've spent 9 months of the year in Austin. I wonder if I'll ever call Austin home. Maybe only if I live here when I'm more settled in my life. What's weird is that though I am going to college with a goal, and doing reasonably well and taking courses that I myself have chosen, I still can't but help feel at time that I'm not sure where I'm going. Or if I will reach these goals. I wonder if others feel the same way. I'm quite sure they do which is probably why when the weekend rolls around six packs are brought in. I, myself, have never drank, so maybe that's why I feel that I am taking the whole impact of this college thing, so much more than others. I kind of figured out why college students feel so pressured in college and I've came up with several reasons. First, you have to study like hell to do well. Second, sometimes you can study and not do as well as you expect. Third no folks around to cry on their shoulder and then you can't because you're a so called wuss if you do. Fourth there's no tangible evidence like money to make you feel like you're going to succeed. By the time a kid reaches college level he or she wants the financial freedom of an adult but knows it way down the road. Sometimes that road seems too foggy to see down. Finally if your a momma or daddy's boy you miss that home cooking. With all that dry and dull food and on top of that mounds of homework and hours of studying to do any right person would not call Austin their home. Not just yet. We all need a safe haven to go to. Mine is in Houston. "
Tell me about yourself.,THIS IS MY FIRST YEAR HERE AT UT AND I AM ENJOYING IT. I AM A TRANSFER STUDENT FROM DALLAS AND I AM MAJORING IN EDUCATION. I HOPE TO TEACH IN AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN DALLAS. I LIVE IN AN APARTMENT OFF OF RIVERSIDE WITH MY BESTFRIEND. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME FOR BOTH OF US TO BE APART FROM OUR FAMILIES. I AM DOING GOOD. I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE HOME SICK THE FIRST WEEK HERE. BOY WAS I WRONG! I WENT HOME THIS PAST WEEKEND BECAUSE MY BESTFRIEND HAD A DOCTORS APPOINTMENT IN DALLAS. I WAS SO READY TO COME HOME(AUSTIN). I HAD ALREADY STARTED TO MISS MY CUTE LITLLE APARTMENT AND THE PEACE AND QUIETNESS THAT I HAVE HERE. MY FRIENDS CAME IN FOR THE LABOR DAY WEEKEND TO VISIT. THEY WERE ONLY HERE TWO DAYS AND THEY HAVE TOLD ME THAT THEY BOTH MISS IT. IN THE SPRING SEMESTER MY OTHER BEST FRIEND WILL BE MOVING DOWN HERE FOR SCHOOL. SHE IS ALSO MAJORING IN EDUCATION. WE BOTH LOVE KIDS VERY MUCH. NEXT FALL WE WILL ALL BE LIVING TOGETHER. IT WILL BE FOUR OF US IN ALL. WE HAVE BEEN FRIENDS FOR ALMOST SEVEN YEARS. ALL OF US ARE VERY CLOSE AND I WORSHIP OUR FRIENDSHIP. I HAVE A LITTLE SISTER WHO IS A SOPHOMORE AT A MAGNET SCHOOL IN DALLAS. WE USUALLY DON'T GET ALONG BUT THAT IS NORMAL FOR OUR AGES AND FOR US TO BE SIBLINGS. I HAVE TWO OLDER SISTERS WHO I GET ALONG WITH PERFECTLY AND MISS VERY MUCH. THE ONE I SEEM TO MISS EVEN MORE IS MY PRECIOUS DARLING NEPHEW ETHAN. HE WILL BE FOUR YEARS OLD IN NOVEMBER. AND IS AS SPOILED AS THEY COME. MY FAMILY IS VERY CLOSE. MY MOTHER AND LITTLE SISTER ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO ARE LIVING AT HOME. MY FATHER PASSED WAY IN 97 FROM LEUKEMIA. I HAVE TWO BROTHERNLAWS WHOM TRY THEIR HARDEST TO TAKE CARE OF MY FAMILY.

I KNOW I WILL BE A GOOD MOTHER. I DON'T WANT ANY OF THAT ANY TIME SOON. RIGHT NOW I AM ONLY WORRIED ABOUT TAKING CARE OF MY SCHOOL. 
Tell me about yourself.,"My main thoughts right now consist of music. I am thinking of a new song that I wrote about my thoughts on the people that I have seen at UT. Music I feel is the greatest thing in the world because I get to release all my emotions through a song. I think most people do not understand music or in that same since the love for sound and melody. These reasons have helped me to conclude why people like bad music like boy bands. Surely anybody with any amount of intelligence could see that these bands or groups, have no talent except that they can sing other peoples songs. I don't believe any of them write their own songs, so I can't see why people would think they are talented. This brings me to something else I do not like about people, they are generally fake. What I mean by this is that they do everything to impress others and not them selves. For example, people try to fit in with a crowd by wearing certain types of clothes and name brands of everything. This things I do not do and hopefully never will. I feel that people really do not know what they want or even how to get to where they do know. I thought by coming to UT that I would see less of this type of attitude from people but I now know that this is not the case and people are like that everywhere go in life. From this point I would like to say that UT is great(except for parking)and that I do like more people here then I did in high school. I am not sure what I want to do with the education I am receiving from this school but I hope that very soon I will recognize my calling in life. "
Tell me about yourself.,It seems a bit strange just to be writing to be writing but I am it is probably very interesting to read back over it after you are done writing it. I am so used to being in English classes were you have to keep thinking about what you are writing that it seems strange to me right now that I am just writing thoughts as they are coming out of my mind with no real point are concern of where this is going. I have done an assignment like this for a writing course before but its purpose was to help us learn to let our thoughts flow more vividly on the paper so I am a bit curious about what this could tell about myself. I honestly hate computers and typing so I can't say I am enjoying myself too much right now. The clock seems to always move very slow when you are doing something just to do it for a timed amount of time. I suppose I will just keep rambling on though to get to that twenty minutes. I really did wait until almost the last possible second to do this today. Its around four right now so I will be sending this in just minutes before it is supposed to be turned in. This week has really drained me and I am so glad it is friday. I can actually get some sleep now and go out and unwind and have some fun. I really wanted to cut back on the partying this year but so far I'm not off to a good start at least I'm not going out every night though. I have a job now though so I suppose that occupies a good part of my time. Its a pain trying to balance that and school but at least this gives me money to go out now and have a good time. I'm a little more self dependent then I was last year. I'm not having to call home all the time and ask for money. I just have a couple more minutes so I am trying to think of something to say right now. My mind just feels like mush. My whole body needs sleep and rest but I am going to just go out and wear it out anyway. I'm young I should have fun while I still can. That is exactly what I am going to do now because I have reached my little time limit so I hope you have had a great time reading my ramblings from my little mind. 
Tell me about yourself.,"I guess that I should start by telling you where I am. I am in my dorm room at Castilian. I only had one class today, Calculus. I don't really like Calculus that much. But it hasn't been too bad so far. I want to call my old band director and tell him good luck tonight. Tonight is their first football game and they are playing the Astrodome. I got to play in the Astrodome once. It was really cool. At first I was really envious of my friends still in high school because they were going to get to play there again. But then I realized that I was going to get to play at the UT Stadium and at many other great stadiums across the country throughout my time here at UT. My roommate is playing a video game now and I'd really rather be doing that. Not because I dislike this assignment, but because I haven't gotten to play any games in a long time. School and band are taking up a lot of my time. But I think that is good. I like to stay busy. Last year in high school I was in band, jazz band, choir, pop choir, mock trial, KEY club, a little student council, and track. I had a great time and was doing stuff constantly. I would like to have that kind of life here. I think that I would like to join a fraternity, Longhorn Singers, a Bible Study group, mock trial, and anything else I can find time for. I like being a part of many different things. That way I can have friends from all over and with many different interests. UT has been very interesting so far. I love the way my schedule works. I am through with my classes today and it is only 12:45 (The day by the way is Friday if anybody is actually reading this). I think that I would like for somebody to read this even though it isn't the most exciting paper in the world. At least then I wouldn't have written it just see how accurately I type. Anyways, I'm not sure what I should be writing about. Uhhhh. My parents are going to be here tonight. They are coming up here (or over here technically) to watch me march at my first college football game. My mom is really excited. My dad is also but he is also coming to see the game. My mom could careless about the game. All right! Only 3 more minutes. Uhhh. I have a really nice view of the city from my room. It's on the twentyfirst floor. It really sucks trying to get up here on an elevator though. And it's really hard trying to find a place to practice my trumpet in a dorm. I tried the roof but it was locked. I'm really hungry now and that's good because I only have about thirty more seconds to type. Yaady yaady yaady and now I'm done. I am going to go eat. Thank you to whoever has read this. And if nobody has or ever will, there isn't much that I can do about it. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, I suppose since this is a stream of consciousness exercise I will just say whatever is on my mind, which at the moment happens to be how incredibly horrible this past weekend was. But, let's back up and get the basics down. For graduation, my grandparents promised to buy me a new computer. New, being the operative word. So they told me to go find one that I liked and tell them where it was. My mother and I went out and looked at computers and found a nice setup that included a printer for about $1500. We thought that sounded reasonable, so we informed my grandparents of the computer's location and they said it sounded good. HOWEVER, they went to see my Uncle's family in Dallas for my cousin's birthday and decided to go a cheaper route and not buy a namebrand computer. So I ended up with this piece of crap that keeps shutting down on me. My Dad has been freaking out for the past two weeks how he knew all along we should have gotten a different computer in the first place and how my grandparents always go the cheaper route even when it means less quality and now my entire college career is jeopardized because I cannot get online. So I spent Saturday messing with my computer, trying to reinstall stuff to see if it was a software problem. It wasn't. My Uncle drove in from Dallas on Sunday and took Windows off, reinstalled it, deleted my C drive (which is a big deal), then created a new one and repartitioned it, Everything SEEMED to work for a brief period of time before my computer decided to do one more mad little dance of irony and shut itself down. Now I am stuck with a computer that doesn't even partially compute and my Dad has to come pick it up to take it to some store called ""Computer Doctor"" and meanwhile he's still ranting about how he was right all along and my Mother should talk my grandparents into getting me a new computer, and if they don't how my parents should because if they don't I'm going to flunk because after all everything is online nowadays, etc. So I wasted my weekend sitting up in my room with my family when I could have been in the music room practicing. And I'm a music major, not computer science, so the music building is where I should be. But my mother wouldn't let me go to the music building because she wanted me to be around while they were messing with my computer. So I didn't practice AT ALL this weekend when my professor says I should practice 4 hours a day at least, and I just got a bunch of new music and now I'm totally screwed for my lesson on Friday. I also am having trouble in my music theory class because my teacher never bothered to tell me what an augmented interval or a diminished interval is, and they expect us to learn this stuff in one night, and since we have the class everyday, it's not like we can procrastinate at all. It's very frustrating. or maybe it's just me. I don't know. All I know is that I haven't even typed for ten minutes yet and I'm still complaining. It's not like I usually procrastinate about anything anyway. I mean, I was valedictorian of my high school, I think I know something about time management. Although, being valedictorian of my school was no terrible feat. I went to all the parties and pulled all the typical high school stunts, and had the highest number of ""unexcused absences"" you could have without being held back. And I wrote my speech at three in the morning the day of graduation. So I guess I know a little about procrastination anyway. But I had a reason for waiting that long really! When it was certain that I was going to be valedictorian, everybody started giving me tips, like they knew what they were talking about. ""Don't make it too long, I'll pay you five dollars to say my name, don't make it too boring. I don't want to sit through some damn boring speech. "" Even friends' parents were giving me tips. Everybody wanted to know what I was going to say, so I just didn't even try to come up with anything until the last minute, so I wouldn't have anything to tell them. Most people like me speech I guess. I worked in a favorite quote of mine by Theodore Roosevelt about how the real cowards are the ones who never try. It's a really encouraging quote, and I always used to repeat it to myself when I went to violin auditions because I am an extremely nervous performer. I also used to repeat that thing from Dune by Frank Herbert that the main character Paul used to say ""I will not fear. Fear is the mind killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. "" etc, etc. It always sort of helped me get a grip on myself I guess which I need because I'm a very insecure person. And I'm sure that my typing is annoying my roommate right now because I have to use her computer and she's trying to sleep and her computer is right by where her head is on her bed. It's only 12:34 though, and she always goes to sleep around midnight which I think is weird. But then I'm an insomniac and I can never sleep anyway, so I'm usually up until about three. I also am a coffee addict. have been since the age of seven. I think it usually surprises people that I've been drinking coffee so long, but my Dad used to drink at least a pot a day, to that was a drink that was always available. You'd think it would have stunted my growth, but I'm 5'7"". Then again, my brother is only 15 and he's 5'9"", so maybe I would have been taller. Maybe not. I sort of like my height. Hmm, I've got two minutes to go, and I lost my train of thought, so I guess I'll just keep typing until something comes to me. Oh, I'm listening to the soundtrack from ""Schindler's List"" right now. I totally love that movie and the music makes me cry. Music always makes me emotional, but this cd is played by Itzhak Perlman whom I personally feel is the greatest violinist in the world, although Joshua Bell, who did the soundtrack for the ""Red Violin"" is also really good, but younger so he doesn't have as much experience. I'm sure he will be so much better when he's older though. Well, it's been twenty minutes. It was interesting. a little personal odyssey of the mind there. Bye! "
Tell me about yourself.,"Today I am leaving for my grandfather's funeral. I am so sad that he had to pass on. I know that he is in a better place now and can no longer feel pain, but I wish he was still here. Even if he could only stay for a few minutes. I just want to tell him how important he is to me and how much I love him. I would tell him how strong he is and how everyone looked up to and admired him. I wish that I could tell him how jealous I am of him, because his life was so interesting and fulfilled. But, most of all, I would tell him how much I love him. I am not really sad that my grandfather has passed away, I am sad because there is so much left unsaid. I just hope that he already knows everything that I wish I would have told him, before it was too late. I find it so odd that every time someone you know or love passes on, you sit and ponder all of the things that you wish you would've told them and vow to never make that mistake again. But time passes so quickly that you never get the chance to tell everyone that means anything to you that the are important, that they are somebody to you. I guess that my twenty minutes is up. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, all that is on my mind sure cannot be summed up in twenty minutes, but I will continually type for that time. Lately I have desired to do nothing but become closer to God. He is awesome. My freshman year of high school was great all because I had God on my side. Now I feel like I have lost him. I know He is still there for me, but I have damaged that relationship that we had. I chose to live my life and not listen to Him. It hurts because life was stressfree and I always knew that God was just right there waiting for me everywhere I went. When I would walk outside I would smile and greet God with open arms. Now I feel like sometimes I look negatively upon the weather and don't even think of the great God who made everything. I have been trying to become closer to God. I read in the Bible more often. Rather than praying for myself or for God to do great works in my life, I now ask God what I can do to better the lives of others. I think that my outlook on life will change once I fully begin to ask Him what He wants of me rather than demanding Him to help me. I think once my relationship with Him improves, my money worries will go away. One worry is about transferring out of the school of business. I could transfer out of the business school, but I am afraid of what my future holds. I know with a business degree at UT jobs will be flying at me from every direction. Instead of being a cutthroat businesswoman, I want to help society. If I would get paid a good amount, I would definitely help the homeless or disabled. That attitude is wrong. God does not want me to think like that. He wants me to trust that He will provide all my financial necessities. He wants me to pray to Him to find out what I need to do in life. He will give me meaning once I am fully ready to accept His answer. I continually pray to God asking Him what I am to do with my life. He has not told me. I do not think it is that He has not told me; I think He has told me to wait for the right time for him to tell me. I know He will let me know when He feels I am ready to accept the task He has prepared for me. Right now I long to know what that task is. As I read the Bible daily and pray to Him daily, I feel I am taking one step closer to receiving a better understanding of my life and knowing what I am destined to do. I cannot wait until God shows me the way to my career, my husband, my kids, my destiny, but I always have to remember what my mom says. God and her both agree: patience is a virtue and in order to obtain these goals, I need to be patient. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now I'm listening to Travis. The band not the person. It can be really confusing talking about all the Travises that I know. There's the band, which happens to be from Ireland and is really awesome. Then there is Travis who goes to school here. There is Travis who goes to Trinity and who I dated at the beginning of the summer. I really liked him. It's too bad that didn't work out. Then there is Travis who goes to TCU and who I really like a whole lot. I've liked him for almost two years now. We just really connect and get along. It's crazy when you meet someone you just work with. I have met a few people like that, and I'm not just talking about boys, but all relationships. I always feel lucky when I know someone who is like me, who I can just hang out with and be boring with and just have so much fun. My mom and I are like that too. I miss her so much. She is my best friend. I know some people say that, and it just becomes another petty phrase, but when I say it, I mean it with all of my heart. She is the most awesome person I have ever met. I want to be just like her. That is my goal, my stretch, the place I know I can never reach, but my dream. She is my stars. I would be so happy even to be half as great as she is. She is a teacher, but not only in the sense that she works at a school and teaches her students French. It is one of her innate gifts. She is a teacher and a nurturer. When you let her be those two things, awesome things happen. Now that I let her be those things in my life, we have the most fulfilling relationship one could ever ask for. All I have to do is hear her voice and I am practically in tears. It's crazy how much I miss her. I've never missed anyone so much in my life. I just want to be with her all of the time. It's crazy how this is my mother and I feel so close to her. I'm not supposed to be in that place for at least a few more years. I guess I am just incredibly lucky. My family is the most important thing in my life. I figure it will take time until I get used to being away from them. I don't think anyone would ever peg me as the homesick type. I would have never pegged myself as the homesick type. I had no clue I would take it this hard. That's a surprise. I guess it's such a shock because two years ago first of all I was not so close to them, and I was a major stoic. No feeling. And now I am not afraid to admit that I love my family and miss them. I think that I am going to go home this weekend. I wasn't planning on it, but I don't want to stay away from them that much longer and there's no reason I have to since I do live in San Antonio. It's not like it's a terrible trip. My father makes it every day. I don't know if I'm going to though. I really don't want to ride home between two huge men in my dad's carpool again, and I don't have my car yet so I don't know. I'm still listening to my Travis CD and really enjoying. It's on the last song, which lasts almost 15 minutes and is like 4 songs in one. It is really great. Sometime I have to listen to the words though, because I really have no idea what it is about. Now I'm back to being excited about seeing the band. It's in less than two weeks, and Travis from TCU is coming down to see them with me. That is going to be so awesome. I really want to go home but the whole carpool thing really bugs me. Maybe I should call my dad and tell him that. Just tell him that I don't want to ride home with his carpool because that is a terrible experience. Maybe he would be able to work something out for me. Well, the CD stopped, and twenty minutes has elapsed, so those are my cues to stop writing. I'm going to go make my decision now. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well currently I am stressed out. It is as if I have so much to do and not enough time to do it. I get real frustrated and tired yet, things must be done. My academics take up a significant amount of time and then there's my extracurricular activities. I am so used to being involved to the point that I came to college and repeated the same cycle. My grades reflect this. I just want to get at least a 3. 6 and go to a decent medical school. My sorority's members are some of the most elite black women on campus, in the community and in the world. All of my friends want to become members. I am so nice to them which is not the proper protocol for interested people. My line sisters reiterate to me daily that I must learn how to be stern and forceful to them instead of befriending them. At our interests meetings we turn mean. How can I hug them on the behind closed doors and intimidate them at meetings. I don't want them to consider me a hypocrite and I want to maintain that level of friendship. They look to me for knowledge and direction instead of evilness and cruelty. My first mind is saying forget what people are saying those are your friends. My second mind is saying that they don't respect you and they feel as though the have nothing to prove because we are already friends. They'll learn when what's up y'all turns into, salutations and how are you. I have so much on my mind that I believe my mind is going to overload and explode. Must do homework, must practice, must get involved, must go to work are just a few of my daily struggles with my time  "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am so stressed out right now I don't even know what to do. If it's not one thing it's another. Everything seems to be coming at me all at once and there is no escape. I'm trapped. I have so much inside that I want to let out, and sometimes I don't know what to do with myself. There are just too many pressures. Sometimes I wish I could ignore all the pressures and just have fun and everything would still be okay. But it wouldn't be. Sadly, I'm stuck with all of these barriers that keep me from being who I really want to be. I wish I could just be Mary all of the time. But, it's impossible. I'm always too worried about everything, but I think you're better off worrying than just not caring at all. I always seem to look at many things in a different perspective than most people. I also find it hard to express those perspectives. Most people just don't care, but I seem to fret over everything. Maybe I'm obsessive, I don't know! But to top it off, I'm pretty happy where I am today. I guess all the fretting over tests and exams in the past got me where I am today. I can't believe how some people really are. Some people I know are on so much alcohol or drugs, that that's all they think about, and forget about life and forget about their dreams. They let their life pass them by, and before they know it they'll be a big nobody in the world. I don't want to waste my lifetime like that. While I'm still young I want to take so much advantage of the opportunities that I have. I would love to contribute to the world and be the best person I can possibly be. I don't care what anyone says or thinks about me. I know the truth, and no one can judge me accept God. I want to be able to smile at the world and the world to just smile back. But the world is not that nice. It is such a mean, ugly world that sometimes I wish I didn't live in it. But the world can also be a magnificent thing to experience. There's just so much you can do, but it feels like so little time. Sometimes I'm scared that there won't be enough time to do whatever it is that I want to do. A friend once told me to do at least one thing a day that scares you. I like that advice. There's so much inside of me that I want to explode! And I wonder if this feeling will disappear with age. Well, I certainly hope not. I want to be 85 and feel like I'm still 15. A lot of times I wish I were 3 or 4 again with no worries or responsibilities. I believe being around that age was the best time of my life. I had no real care in the world. I was too confused to. I had no idea I actually existed in the outside worldI just was. Well, I could go on forever but I got things to do. I kind of like this assignment. It's neat. Well, I don't want to bore you or anything, and I think my 20 minutes is up! So, it was nice chatting with you Dr. P! "
Tell me about yourself.,"Ok I have to type for twenty minutes straight. This is kind of odd, I've never done anything like this before so I don't quite know what to do! I should be doing my economics homework but forget it, I'll do it later. I don't even understand it anyways. Calculus is a pain in the back too, I'll wait until Monday to do that homework. I can't wait to go home this weekend and see all my old friends. It's been a while since we've all hung out. I hope I don't miss any really good parties this weekend, but I probably will. In a little while I have to go take a shower and get ready to go out with the girls at the house. We'll probably go to 6th Street or something like that. I'm glad I finally get to go out tonight, I've been sitting in my room for a week straight. Ok I'm bored and am running out of things to say already. I have nothing else to think about right now! Full House is on the TV and I'm getting annoyed with Michelle whining. Why is the TV on this channel anyways? I guess my roommate put it on. I'm glad she's gone right now. I needed some peace and quiet. I'm getting real hungry I hope Danielle wants to go eat soon. Gosh I still have another load of laundry I have to do before I leave tomorrow. I get to sleep in until one tomorrow because I don't have class until 2. That rocks. My room is so messy but I'm way too lazy to clean it right now. It's dusty more than cluttered. Oh well, I'll get over it. Hold on my phone is ringing. It's my boyfriend Matt just saying hi as usual. I wish I saw him more. It's a lot easier now that I'm in Austin but it's still not the same as living in the same town. Oh I totally forgot that he can't go to San Antonio this weekend, looks like I'll be without him again. I really need to catch up with some of my old friends this weekend. We need to party and hang out like we used to. I might end up going to the high school football game if there is nothing else to do. I just don't want to look like a hasbeen with a bunch of high school students and then a college student just chilling out there. Ha ha that might be pretty funny actually. I'll get Robyn to come with me so I don't feel too stupid. Oh I like this song. I wanted to go to the concert but the tickets were all sold out. Speaking of tickets I never did get the Dave Matthews tickets for the September show in Houston. I can't believe I forgot to get them. Now I'll never get tickets. Looks like I'll miss out on yet another awesome concert. At least I'm in Austin now. No good bands come to San Antonio, so I'll get to go to plenty of concerts here. I still haven't gotten my stupid Ethernet Card yet. I went to the computer store earlier but they didn't have any more for laptops. This stupid thing isn't worth all the trouble! This song is so annoying. I need to find that remote control right now. Much better. I think this is Matt's CD. He has plenty of mine so it's ok if I don't give this back for a while. He won't miss it. Ok I really am so bored and hungry it's unreal. I need to take a shower but I'll just wait until this thing is done. Two more minutes. I can do that. I want to go dancing tonight. That sounds like fun. None of my friends back in SA want to go so I'll find some of the KD's to go with me. My room is so crowded with pointless junk. I should take some of it back home this weekend but I probably won't just because I'll forget or something will come up. I need to get this roll of film developed sometime soon so I can put some new pictures up. I'm sick of looking at all these old ones. Well my time is just about up for this thing so bye bye for now! "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm doing this writing assignment and I hope I do it right so I don't fail the class. I wonder what that noise is in the room beside me. I think it is a telephone that someone needs to answer. Now they left it off the line and it is beeping continuously. Now it stopped. My hands are so freezing. I think this is the coldest room in the entire dorm. I wonder if my roommate is swimming yet. I hope she is because that means that I can swim at Gregory as well. I have so much homework to do and the teachers assign so much reading to do. It's almost impossible to get it all done and have time for any type of social life. plus my family and friends are demanding my time so much that I feel like I am going to explode and I don't want to tell them this because I know it would hurt their feelings then I would feel guilty and I hate to feel guilty. My back hurts from walking so far with that heavy backpack on my back. This campus is so huge that you have to walk like miles just to get where you're going or at least it seems that way. I wonder how I will fit everything in that I want to do tomorrow. I know I need to spend time with my sorority and I need to see my mom tomorrow before she leaves and I have to get all of my reading done for next week. Boy, I didn't realize how worried I actually get until actually having to type my thoughts down  no wonder I can't ever sit still  I feel like I have to constantly be doing something or I will fail someone else or myself. Just writing this right now makes me want to cry. I hope my dad is okay at home  he really needs to stop working so much in the heat. I wish I had gotten closer with him before I moved but he didn't make too much of an effort either but still I guess I could have made the first step. But it seems like we just don't ever have anything to talk about. I know he's proud of me  I can see that when he cries when he is proud of one of my accomplishments. I just feel so guilty for not talking to him more. I hope he doesn't think I don't love him or care about him. I wonder if my mom is getting along with Belle tonight  I hope she isn't being rude. So many people are rude to Mom and I hope she knows that when I'm rude to her I don't mean to be and I try to be the nicest one to her. So many people take her for advantage  I hope she comes out of her surgery well next week  I don't know what I would ever do if I didn't have her. I feel that way about my mom and my dad  well actually a lot of people. I just hope everyone I know will last longer than me so I won't have to say goodbye but then if that happened, I wouldn't be here much longer  I guess they should go first because they're older but I just don't wish death upon anyone. Sometimes when I really hate people like Erin, I really think I want them to disappear but then I think of their families and even though I don't care about the girl, her family never did anything to me so why should I wish her dead? Goodness I'm going into some really embarrassing things. I hope whoever reads this doesn't think I'm psycho or something. I'm not  or I don't think I am  I guess people with problems don't realize they have those problems. My shoulder is really aching from typing. it's the same shoulder that always hurts though. I wonder if I have a bone spur or something. My hands are so cold it feels impossible to type. I wonder if the psychology department is going to use these writings for some kind of experiment or something. I wonder how much time I have left. Oh, I'm through! I hope I did this right! "
Tell me about yourself.,"Last night around 11pm or so a friend of mine from high school came knocking at my door. She told me that a guy I went to high school with had just committed suicide on Friday. Apparently he had a fight with his parents about his drug abuse (which I had no idea was even an issue with him) and he stormed out of the house. No one knew where he was so they went looking for him. They found his body by a creek in a neighborhood near mine (some of my friends still live there, too). It still hasn't hit me yet. I have been at school with him since the first grade. I know that at the funeral, it will definitely hit me. After last year I thought everything was going to be better. At the beginning of the school year (actually the summer before my senior year) Kyle committed suicide by hanging himself. After getting over that, Will was killed in a car accident. After coping with Will's death, I thought nothing else was going to happen. I mean, two deaths (not to mention the death of teacher) happened within the span of about three or so months. The rest of my year was going great until April. That was when I found out that one of the girls who I had been best friends with in elementary and junior high had committed suicide. She overdosed on her medication and died in her sleep. I couldn't believe it. For years I would talk to her and hang with her and played sports with her all through middle school. Going to her funeral was the hardest thing that I have EVER had to do. I cried the minute I got there and didn't stop crying until days later. Seeing her parents made it even harder. I mean what can you say to them. Nothing you could ever come up with could make them feel any better. Nothing could make you feel any better either. She had an open casket, so as we walked out after the service was over, we had to pass by her. I absolutely and completely fell apart. I couldn't see where I was going I was crying so hard. Even now as I am writing this assignment I'm getting tearyeyed. I still don't understand (and I probably never will) why anyone could take their life like that. I mean, don't they know how many people need them, how many people depend on them, or how many people just love them for who they are and how they make us feel when we're around them. Marshall is the second one to kill themselves from my elementary/junior high school. Everyone always talks about how things like that come in three's. Now I'm just wondering if the saying will come true. Will there be a third suicide or death that I'll have to deal with? I really and truly hope so. I sure as hell can't take another death or another funeral for that matter. When I first started this assignment I didn't think that I'd have much to say, but that doesn't look like the case. This is kind of therapeutic though. I'm tired of talking and thinking about a gloomy subject like death, so I've decided to start typing about something better. I really excited to be here at the university. I really love it here. My classes and professors are great. I am worried/anxious about final exams though, but I still have awhile before those come around. I'm still getting used to the fact that you pretty much get one grade at the end of the semester. Unlike in elementary through high school in which every 3 weeks you got a progress report and then every 6 weeks came your report card. I'm also getting used to being alone a lot. Sometimes you have to eat by yourself, or sit in class by yourself, etc. But then again you meet so many new people. Well, my time's up. "
Tell me about yourself.,"So here are twenty minutes of Brian's thoughts. As I sit here, I am dumbfounded by the ignorance of humans. Today I talked to a coworker about religion. He found out that I'm agnostic and proceeded to proselytize. I can respect this, because his religion dictates that people who don't accept Jesus Christ will go to hell. But at the same time, I poked several holes in the Christian philosophy and in the Bible. He wasn't able to counter my arguments, and he responded only by saying that he has faith. This epitomizes human ignorance. I have faith the chair I'm sitting in now will not collapse and harm me. This faith is based on my past experiences with chairs and with seeing things that turn out to, in fact, exist. Yet he claims he has ""faith"" in a god that nobody on this planet can prove they've seen. I can just as well assert via faith that there is a Pink Elephant on the other side of the moon that we'll never see. I've never seen this elephant, but I KNOW it's there. I have faith. It speaks to me through the Elephant Spirit. What the fuck is that all about? How can someone bastardize his or her beliefs to knowledge like this?? It is incomprehensible to me. I realize that people have a deepseated need for absolutes. Nobody wants to think our planet is a lonely hunk of dirt floating in space, so instead we conjure up deities that give our lives and our very existence meaning. Never mind that there is absolutely no reason to believe we are correct save a book compiled thousands of years ago based on events hundred or thousands of years before that! Who needs logic and reason anyway? And it never ceases to amaze me that some scientists still embrace religion! It scares me how easy it is for them to walk away from work and into church and never mingle the two because they're so incompatible. It makes me truly sad that people can be so stupid. Thankfully our society is progressing further and further away from religion, albeit at a crawling pace. And even so, rather than shedding this relic of our intellectual infancy we simply mold the religion (absolute truth, mind you) to fit our current society and way of life. I'm dumbfounded. It also amazes me how closedminded people can be. I'm gay. Big deal. Yet many people (though a few proportion in Austin) perceive me as evil for it. My actions are vile and disgusting to them. Never mind the fact that homosexual activity occurs in nature, though not as frequently as heterosexual behavior. And don't even touch upon the fact that there is no logical, reasonable justification for opposing homosexuality. People have all these notions that homosexuals are pedophiles or that we try to ""recruit. "" At the risk of sounding pessimistic in my writing and thoughts, I can't believe how moronic our society is, on average. We even have Al Gore in the news saying he opposes samesex marriage based on religious reasons. (Hmm, are my two pet peeves of the day related? Of course!) J. And so I'm left sitting here, wondering how people can be so stupid as to embrace Christianity and oppose homosexuality. Ugh. THESE are the times that try men's (and women's) souls! Which brings up another point. I'm so annoyed at how misogynistic our society is. The craze in the past decade has been political correctness, and conservatives are sick of it. But things haven't changed nearly as much as people think. I still sit through lectures where the professor refers to every character described (a banker, an investor, a CEO) as he. he. he. I can't stand it. But perhaps it's not so much that these professors are bigoted to some degree. Perhaps they're simply trying to convey the way the world really is! Because women don't have anywhere near an equitable stake in society. In finance we were shown some subcommittees of the boards of directors of Procter and Gamble and Home Depot, Inc. Out of some two dozen positions between the two companies ONE PERSON was a woman! I can't stand it. I feel like I'm a bastion of fairness and equity and reason in a sea of stupid people! (Keep in mind, I'm not this pessimistic in my day to day activities, perhaps just in my mind. Hehe. ) And, not that I'm trying necessarily to relate it to our class, this is all psychology! It's probably evolutionary psychology more than anything. With regard to religion, as survival machines for our genes, we'd like to believe we will continue indefinitely. This manifests itself in various religions that promise us eternal life. And we'd like to believe that our existence isn't arbitrary, so we conjure up a god who gives us meaning, ignoring the myriad moral and logical problems this presents. With homosexuality. gay people don't reproduce if they fully express their sexuality. Of course not all do, which is why homosexuality could persist in the population as long as it has. And so on some level I'm sure we're afraid that if we accept homosexuality, more people will ""choose"" to be homosexual. Then the species will die out! Oh no! (I know per Richard Dawkins that evolutionary psychology operates on a genetic level, not a societal level, but you see my point. ) Anyway, I suppose that's my time for this week. Tune in again next week for more ramblings from Brian's ultraliberal mind. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, today was a bad day. Not bad in the sense that negative things happened, it just wasn't good. I talked to Maggie, the girl I really like, and it turns out she doesn't feel the same way. Earlier in the week (I hope Lori isn't reading this) I had another girl come out and tell me she had feelings for me. I hope Maggie doesn't view me as I view the girl. She is nice, but I feel awkward. I don't know how to act or respond sometimes. Am I sending the wrong signal? Am I communicating poorly? Who knows? Certainly not me. So, that's that. Maggie Still really likes me as a friend, but nothing more. Kind of sucks. I wish I were more attractive. I think I got the bases covered on personality, just the physical appeal that is holding me back. I'm working at it. I am enrolled in intermediate racquetball and playing whenever I can. I'm up to two pullups. This is a big accomplishment. This summer, I started working out with my best Friend Thomas and then I could do any. Now two. I so excited. Thomas goes to A&M. He was supposed to come here, with me, but decided that ""pep"" and ""spirit"" was his thing. I'm cool with that I guess, I just wish I wasn't stuck with the ""potluck"". Will, my roommate is all right and all, I just wish I could open up a little more than I do. He doesn't ""get me"" like another one of my good friends would. My best friend from high school, Greg Wayne, will be coming up this weekend. I can't wait. I miss just hanging out with the crew. I like college and all, and I'm making the transition fine, I just miss the good ole days. I am coming to terms so much better than some I know. Katie, the one who came forward to me about her feelings, is having a really ruff time. Apparently, whenever she tries to talk to her mom about it they get in a fight. So instead, the just avoids confrontation all together. Not a very wise approach if you ask me; and she did, and I told her. I like meeting new people. Katie apparently doesn't. It's out of her comfort zone. Actually, that's how I met Maggie. She's so awesome. She into anime just like me, she draws, she's tall, and she just all around cool. Sadly, she does not share this sentiment to the extent of which I put forth. She thinks I'm hilarious and a great guy to hang out with, but she just doesn't like me like that. I should go on, get over her and whatnot. I cant. I've tried. I like her way too much. I will eventually though, or that is what I've been told by the ones I open up to here besides Maggie. Vivian is a great friend. She thought that I liked her at first, but then I started opening up to her about Maggie and she understood. She rooms with Martha, whom I met at orientation. She had a thing for me too. I don't know, when I like them, I get turned down and away, but when I just think they are cool, I get asked out. Why can't things go my? Be different, somehow? This can't be fair. I try so hard to get what I want. It never just comes to me. Like now, in engineering, I have decided that I don't like engineering, but I'm stuck there for at least the semester. I enjoy PSY301 with Pennebaker. He's a character and the subject matter interests me. I would consider psych as a major, but that is my brothers field and I'm already too into his shadow. Oh well. We will see how things turn out. They usually do. For the better, or worse. what's the difference? I don't know. Could I even tell? If I follow that principle things would turn out regardless. good, or bad. Who cares? Well, I do. The future is uncertain and that is why it's scary. Whether or not this is actually read or just run through an analyzer, it has been a good place to vent. I look forward to the next installment in this tedious tale of love, trust, faith, and social bearings. Until the next time. =) "
Tell me about yourself.,"I've been thinking and this ""freshman fifteen"" thing has to be an urban legend. I mean, really, I've never walked so much in my entire life. Everything is about a fifteen minute walk from my dorm so I figure, if I walk to class to my dorm to class to lunch to my dorm, that has to be a few miles just walking the campus. Then I run errands and visit my friends and before I know it I've had an entire week's workout. And then when I have extra time I go to the gym and I know I'm not alone on this because it's always so damn full. For instance, tonight the entire weight room was full and every last piece of equipment was being used. So I know I'm not the only one who walks, like 20 miles a day and still goes to the gym. But let's suppose I rode the Campus Loop everywhere and didn't go to the gym, then would I gain weight? No because the Jester cafeteria is not somewhere I go for seconds. Of course the food isn't the worst I've ever eaten, but I'm definitely not going to over indulge in it. And on top of all of that they post the fat grams at the buffet line. There is no way to ignore the fact that you're eating unhealthy. It's all spelled out for you six inches from your face. Cheese Pizza: 19 grams of fat; Hamburger Topping: 6 grams of fat. How can you ignore that? But I guess these are all positive things because the freshmen fifteen is definitely something I want to avoid. I am willing to eat small portions of not so good food, walk 20 miles a day, and still go to them gym because Gosh Darn It! I will not gain the freshman fifteen. I will not. I won't let it happen. I will break the rules and not follow the fate of college students past. I can't do it. I won't do it. I will not gain the freshman fifteen. Besides, it's just an urban legend anyway. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I swear that office space is the funniest movie I have ever seen. ""Yeah, hi!"". ""It's Bill Lumb. "". I can't stop laughing. Albert is on the bed hugging a leopard pillow. Jo just emailed me from St. Louis and I don't know if she's okay. I haven't talked to her since I left for school. She is okay to take care of herself I guess. I can't believe that Pami, Liz and Katy left for Dave without me. They suck, oh well. I'm doing fine myself so I guess it doesn't really matter, shit, I've got the place to myself. College life is pretty bad ass. No one really cares what I do, well I guess my parents care. Oh well, I guess I'm in another state and it really doesn't matter. Liz is so retarded that she bought a poster about the movie Breakfast at Tiffany's. She picked that out of all the Bob Marley and Pink Floyd posters there. I guess that is just her style. ""I'm going to have to ask you to move again to another office"" ""That would be great"" But I set the building on fire. It is so funny I can't even stop laughing. I wonder if Kenny is going to call tonight. I really do wonder how much longer I will really be with him. I love him to death but I'm to young to have a serious boyfriend. Al is so funny. He looks like he would be all buff and mean but he is really complete goof. He tries to get all big so he can impress the ""ho's"" but he doesn't understand that he can't do that. He's to goofy. Just kidding. He kicks ass though so I guess its all good. I can't believe my dad made me add another class. Schools already been going for about two weeks and Ill have to make up the work. Plus all the other stuff I have to do. I want to be able to go out more, and have fun. That's what college is for. I'm still going to study a hell of a lot but also party too. I don't want to miss out on anything and then have to feel regret for not doing all that I'm allowed to do now that I'm in college. I don't understand why everyone is freaking out. I guess their just freshman, well so am I but oh well, and they will get in the hang of it soon enough. Peace out PSYCHOLOGY its been twenty minutes. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am hungry. I haven't eaten since last night. I have a chemistry test on Thursday and I do not understand some of the stuff. I hope nobody comes to my home on Wednesday night. Usually people are always at my home and I don't get any studies done. They stay until 2 or 3 at night and then it is too late to study. Why don't I study in my room? Probably because I don't want to study when people are outside partying. Why don't you go to the library? I don't want to go to the library. After 5, I don't want to have anything to do with school. I don't want to think it even exists. Library reminds of school. On Wednesday, I get off at 5. Good I have until 9 to study until people come over. 4 hours is more than enough to study for a stupid test that is probably easy as hell. I am just worrying over nothing. I actually like it when people come over; it is not boring then. Just do your studies early and then party later. I had heard there were fine women in this university but I was fooled. I haven't seen any girl that is eye popping fine. All the girls on campus have the same old stuff. Legs and other stuff that I do not want to mention here. I am sick of the same old stuff, why can't there be a girl that has a pretty face with all that other stuff. Like a perfect package. Well whatever it is damn hot outside. I have to go to my classes in this heat and then study my brains out. Then go to work and then return home again in this damn heat and still not see a fine girl. Then take the bus home and then study again. Then I hang out with my friends. Which makes doing all this worth it. And I would just like to comment that the damn west campus bus takes at least a half an hour to get to the bus station and sometimes it is full and you have to wait another half hour for another bus. They need to freaking spend a little money to buy more busses, cheap skates. I have do go through all this crap and then I can't even get a decent ride home. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am really enjoying myself to a certain point here at UT. I already am homesick and miss my friends and family. I am having a tough time adjusting to life around here. I just got out of Biology class where my teacher barely speaks English. I know I don't like that class, and really dislike the teacher's methods of teaching. I just know I am really going to have to be on my toes in that class. I am meeting new people here which I hardly ever did back home. I still need to make more friends. I already have feelings of loneliness just because I don't have the support here that I do in Dallas. I hope that changes soon. My time at UT may change from four years to one semester if things do not start to look up. Everyone keeps telling me to stick it out and do my best, but I am not even sure I want to be here. Austin is nice, I know that. However, since I don't know anyone, Dallas is better to me. I know my way around there and have a car and know what things I can do around there as far as entertainment. It's a rough adjustment that I will have to deal with, either now or later. That is the only thing keeping me here. I did meet a girl down here that I knew back home but have no idea what to think about that at the moment. I'd like to think that means something, at least meeting her was a big step in branching out, I guess. I dislike my roommate. He spends every minute of life on his computer. He was up last night until 2:00AM while I am trying to sleep. Jester rooms stay pretty lit with one light on so it was hard to sleep. The guy is just hard to live with, yet he never talks unless I talk to him. His friends call the room all the time, including up to 1:00AM, and stop by the room at again 1:00AM. It ticks me off but what am I going to do? I talked to one of my friends back home last night. He has decided to go back to high school and try to finish. He should have graduated last year but dropped out twice in the same year. He has ruined his life with drugs, but at least he is trying to restart. Man twenty minutes is a long time to write As far as my classes go for college, I know I hate Biology. That is definitely my worst subject. I really don't know what to think about psychology. My grades were not that good in high school in psych but I still remember a little of what I was taught. Mythology looks like it could be fun but I have only been to class twice. I have my teaching class tonight so I'll see how that goes. As far as I know, there are few guys in the class. That could be good or bad. Well that's the end of twenty minutes so I'll see how the rest of this class is before I decide if I like it. I do like the writing assignments so far. Hopefully, that will continue. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I guess I'll just start out by explaining how I feel right now. Because of school, I've been feeling really stressed. Although because of our class I'm not really sure what stress is. To me stress is when I have a lot to do and no time to rest and relax. I haven't been getting as much sleep as I usually do at home, but it doesn't ever feel late at my dorm because everyone's up late. I feel like my whole life is school right now. I live on campus, don't have a car here with me to get away from campus and my classes are spread out all during the day. By the time I get to my dorm in between classes I have to leave in 30 minutes to get to another class 15 minutes away. The days have been going by really fast though. I'm always so busy. I try to just get my work done during the week so I can go out on the weekend and have fun. I'm really excited about college because already I've learned so much. I feel like I'm being able to think better about things. Or I guess maybe deeper about things. Not just school related stuff but stuff about life as well. I've begun to think more about what I want and what type of person more about my opinion on things. I guess you sort of have to be like that at UT, because there are so many people. In high school no one really expressed themselves like the do in college. A lot of the classes push that during the discussion times I guess because the classes are so large. Our psychology class is bigger than my graduating class in high school, and everyone else I talk to have an even smaller class than I did. It's really weird but I keep seeing the same people in a lot of classes. I know of 5 people that are in 3 of my classes. Maybe it's just that I recognize them. I still don't really know what to expect from my classes. Most of them seem interesting except for Calculus and Economics. I really like the experiments we do in class. Ugh, I can't think of anything else to write about. I hope this is the way we were supposed to write this. Actually it's helped me relax and get out some of my feelings even though no one will read this. So I guess it's sort of like a journal. I actually don't feel as stressed now that I've gotten this done. It's one less thing I have to worry about. Now I have to figure out how to copy and paste it. I'm not very good with computers. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Wheres my bank literature. I don't know? I need to call Stefani. I wonder if she cheated one me. I think she did, oh well, in some ways, but I love her. This paper is orange; it looks cool. My dad is here, he's been drinking. We went to hooters. The girls there were completely the finest creature walking on the face of the earth lol. I had so much fun last night. I went to keg Thursday at our pool, then to a party. I met Dawn, we went to a sorority crush party on sixth street at the Soho club. It was so wild, I met sooo many girls, hell girls were all over me it was the greatest thing in the world. I kissed a lot of girls, may have gotten a possible girlfriend, the phone just rang, it was bridgette, she lives in illinois. My dad is watching the drew carey show and setting on my bed drinking on of my beers! he better by me more. Stefani. I love her, but I don't know if I want that to be apart of my life because it brings much stress, bush is a dumbass, now I'm talking to my dad at the same time. Gore was on letterman doing the top ten list. But if I go the other route and try my luck in relationship out with either karen or kareth I have a feeling my life is going to be much better now but maybe not in the future. So I'm torn between love and having a possibly better present life. What do I do???? Oh well, now I'm thinking of this assignment. This just might be the best or most fun assignment I have ever done. It says, you can be yourself, my psychology class is my most favorite class. Its really the only one that actually interests me. I missed class though the other day because our water was cut off and I hadn't taken a shower; that's the second time the water has been cut off here at melrose. It throws such a big dagger into any plans you have. You don't realize how water is such a big part of your life until its taken away. and it almost leaves you not being able to function. I have eight more minutes left. I wonder how much everyone else typed. I figure for some reason I might be typing less who knows. Oh well its not like it has to be a certain length or anything. And plus I can't exactly type as fast as I think. I need help in calculus, I have done really bad on my first two quizzes and am going to look into getting a tutor next week. and before I leave this evening I NEED to sign up for some outlook thingy for email in the business school about setting up a bus account. The girl I set with in class is really pretty, my dad just turned up the tv and is watching a sports show. Wow my stream of conscious is jumping around to everything I didn't realize I thought this much, but this even isn't the half of it because I'm thinking so much more than I can type. I met a UT football player last night, he was really cool. I miss playing football. I'm going to UMHB tonight to party with a few of my friends back from high school. I'm going home this weekend for the first time since I've been here. My clothes are washing. I wish my dad would turn the tv down. I have so many girls phone numbers all over the place from girls, I should really think about organizing that stuff or I'm going to loss them. I hate people who do drugs, so many people don't know how too party right and when enough is enough. Oh did I mention lol I love girls hehe. Wow, they are awesome!. I love to dance, Troy Aikman isn't going to play this week. I set my time on my clock, since the power went out this morning. I use CNN's time by which to set mine. I like watching comedy central, we didn't have it back at home. My computer messed up yesterday. and with that I'm spent! :) "
Tell me about yourself.,"How do you know when you can really know what another person feels. How do I learn to trust what people say to me. It's hard for me to be in a relationship when I can't see that person everyday. I know that I am the kind of person that would never want to cause any pain, yet I see people who are in relationships for such wrong reasons. My friend was telling me that she is dating this guy yet already has plans on leaving him for something better. I don't understand why people can be so selfish to where they don't think of other peoples feelings. I am in a very intense relationship right now. I love my boyfriend with all my heart. Having a long distance relationship is very hard to deal with when you are the type of person who needs that comfort of a companion. I know how I feel for him and I think I know what he feels for me to, yet in a world where people can be so deceitful, I find it still possible that I can be the one being used in a relationship. I guess you must do what your heart tells you to because love is a risk. I believe it is worth taking. When you love someone, you have this vulnerable feeling towards them. I don't want to walk blindly into a relationship, being overwhelmed by the feeling of love but I would want to see how the flow goes. I want to learn how to be a good companion. I hope someday to make a really good wife. I find it important to marry your best friend. I can't wait until I figure out what life has in store for me. I want to do so many things and right now I feel so limited. I just hope that no matter what happens with my relationship now I can keep a friendship. I believe that the first love of your life will never die, and true love lives in you forever. I can never imagine not loving him anymore. I don't want to be person that is dependent on someone else but I do think that it is good to have someone to run to when things do always go right. Sometimes I feel like I don't know what to say when he runs to me with difficulties in his life. He always seems to know what to say to make me smile. When he told me about his cousin in the hospital and how he figured the funeral would be coming soon, I had no idea what to say. I didn't know what to tell him other than the only thing we can do is pray for him. I believe that that is all we have when we come to situations like that. I just wish I could talk to him and be able to be more comforting. I have to feel like I am bringing him a sense of comfort in this relationship. I love him so much and I don't want him to suffer any pain. It is just so hard not being able to physically be there for him because just the comfort of having someone at your side, can help you get through rough times. When I do see him I will hopefully know what to say when that moment comes. I find that ever chance that we do get to see each other I try to absorb the feeling of his presence. I try to remember his scent and the way his lips feel against mine. It's so hard to let go of him. I just want to try to treasure that moment so that it can get me through another week. I miss hearing his voice even though we talked just a day ago. So how do I do this going maybe four years of living in another city. My life right now is perfectly the way that I have always planned and dreamed, except for living away from him. I know that I am not in a place to compromise. I can't compromise my education. I have always dreamed of going to this university and now that I am here, I wouldn't dream of letting this go. Yet my problem is that I don't know that I could ask him to give up what he is doing, because I love him and I know that he loves what he does. Yes, it is possible that he could move to Austin, considering there are jobs available to him, but I wouldn't want him to make that decision because of me. I would want him to have more than me to move. So we just seem to take it day by day, but I can't help but ask ""Where are we going to be next semester, next year or after I graduate?"" my question must wait until the time happens. I have to just learn to have patience and see where destiny takes me. I will become stronger through all of this. I hope to learn selfconfidence and to be more dependent. I know that I have many good things to bring out to people and someday I will know who the person is that deserves my love and affection. Maybe I know it now but in time I will find out whether I am right or not "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am here, miles and miles away from where I started. things are progressing slowly but I can see what I want now. yes for a moment it seems oh so clear and then it fades. it does not matter what I do with my life only that I am alive. anything besides being alive is what the time was like before I was born nothing. I do not fear this nothing however I just know it will be at the end of all my experiences. so I better make these experiences count. there is no resting no relaxing when there are times to be had. I again get distracted though. this body I inhabit continually calls upon me to fulfill its need. if it is not this it is that. but it is the only place my mind has to stay. sure it is a great tool beautiful in a way but I feel the drive to leave it behind. I spend many passages of time trying to discover what feeds the burning inside of me, what will motivate me to take a task to a great level. I want to design I want to build I want to create. a need is present to put something not just something but something carefully crafted out there for others to take in and make it part of their entities. I alone have fed off what others before me have so delicately created and taken it in through my eyes and ears and other senses. all those creations have helped craft the person that I am. so I know it is time to project all this back outwards with a spin that is all my own. and when I do this I must not think about it I must subconsciously perform using the feeling that lay inside me. I have found a companion. we have discovered that when we combine our idea our thought our joy our pain it becomes a thing of greater nature. we are translating our combined impulses into a media, a media that will allow this combination of raw human toil to be available for others if they so choose to spend the time taking it in and seeing if it is a part of them as well. "
Tell me about yourself.,"This is going to be a cool assignment. We just get to talk about what is going on right now in our lives. I think college is going to be really awesome. We are going to learn so much from all the different types of classes we are taking. I am very tired from classes today. It is tiring to walk all around campus. I will not take the loop cause I don't want to be lost or anything. I think that would be scary to get lost on the loop. My roommate just left to the coop. She has to return all these books. My computer is pretty slow and I hope it doesn't break down while I am typing this. I think that Jester is pretty nice. I am glad that my suitemates are really cool. They take me places cause they have cars. One is from Katy, and my other suitemate is from Austin. My really good friend is sleeping, because she is waiting for me to eat. We are going to go eat at Jester probably. It should be interesting cause I really don't like to eat Jester food that much. It was alright at lunch, but I think it is going to be pretty gross tonight. People stare in the windows at Jester. It is weird to think that there are people out there that could be looking at you. It is really has a pretty courtyard though. I am so tired. I don't think I have much homework to do tonight though. It should be interesting, because I have to write a paper for English. I really don't know what I should write it about though. I have no idea. Gregory is a really cool place. You get to run and workout. I like to play volleyball. That has been lots of fun being able to play at night. UT has really cool places to see around it too. I think I have eaten out so much. People here are so different. I think that is really cool though cause if they weren't, this place would be really boring and stuff. The computer is sometimes a waste of time. I know so many people that just sit and chat on the computer for hours. I think it is really fun too, but you don't need to stay on it for a couple of days. People think that college is really easy and therefore don't have to study. I think they are going to get a rude awakening sometime. My suitemate is trying to work her computer. It is pretty funny cause she doesn't really know how to work it. My sisters just sent me a care package. It was really cool. It had like some soap, and candy. It also had like pictures and stuff. I have to move out soon cause of the pipes are being installed. Well, my friend says to write about the future. I don't know about the future. It should be pretty interesting I hope. I think that I will have to study a lot this year. My sister is going to try to help me out though hopefully. She is going to have it hard. I am going to play I'M sports. I hopefully will be able to handle everything cause I know it is really going to be hard and stuff. I eat too much. I am pretty full and all, and we are going to go eat soon. I only have a couple more minutes so I will talk about how my computer is not working. For some reason when I got home it was broken. My friend tried to fix it. I think it will be alright. My favorite tennis player won the US Open yesterday. It was pretty cool. He is really cool. He is from Russia. I am tired once again. I just want to finish this. I have taken Psychology before so I hopefully will be able to help my friends also that are in my class. All the people from where I am from all hang out with each other. It is pretty funny. I think that everyone should meet new people. My friends tried out for the MTV show. I don't know if they made it though. My time is up. I am very happy. "
Tell me about yourself.,"After I finish this paper I'm going to go work out, then get something to eat at Jester Center. I need to get back in shape. I feel better. Then I'll finish reading from my Zen book and economics book. I hope I am not taking the same economics class I did last year at CCCC. That is going to be a big waste if it is. I can't wait to go home on Friday to see my friends and family. It's not all what is cracked up to be down here. Dallas is so much better. It bigger, better stuff to do. I just like that environment. It's ok down here. I really have not met many people. Just my roommate and a few in my dorm. Oh yeah, I almost forgot that I met a very friendly and pretty girl named Tanya today. She lives in 407 of the Towers. She told me to come by. I'm debating on going over there or not. I'm sure Brandi wouldn't like it. Obviously since we are not doing so good right now. I just don't know what to do with her. I feel like if I break up with her it is going to be a mistake. I don't know what I feel. I'm lost. I don't feel like I have the freedom to do what I want to do. Sometimes I just feel like I'm better of with out her. She would be crushed if I broke up with her since it would be like the 10th time. I feel like there is just something else out there better for me, but I never tell her that. The sight of seeing her hurt and crying makes me feel so guilty and sad. I feel so sorry for her. I lie to her all the time about my true feelings because they are so mixed right now. I feel like I'll be lost with out her, but that might be just because I was with her for so long. I am getting pretty hungry right now, but I need to work out first. There are a lot of fine girls that work out. Sometimes I wish I could hook up with one of them. Tomorrow night might be fun. I only have one class, thank god. I hate Tuesday's and Thursday's. Three classes from 812 is forever. Actually I just hate my Cal class. I can't stand sitting in those chairs they are so uncomfortable. Just two more days until I leave. I 'm getting pretty anxious about it. I can't sleep very much at night. I don't fall asleep until 2 or 3. Then I wake up very tired. I can't wait to back to sleep after classes. But then I feel like I'm pressured for time. If I sleep it takes away the time I have to study, therefore taking away my free time. So its either nap, or play. I hope my tests aren't difficult at least after I have studied well. I have this horrible fear that I am not going to do good and fail out. That is the last thing I want to happen. "
Tell me about yourself.,"There are so many things on my mind today. I am still trying to get the hang of college life and trying to cope with the new change. Everything here at UT is so different. College is different. It is not what I expected it to be or even what I had imagined. Do not get me wrong, I love UT, it is just that I am use to the High school ways. You know, the whole part of being spoon fed. Here I have to be responsible, be an adult, make my own decisions, and I am just not ready for that quite yet. UT is so huge and diverse. There are so many people and organizations. Right now I feel overwhelmed and a little out of place. I guess it is because I am a Freshman, but I know that I will get over it soon. I have been missing my family, friends, and boyfriend so much today. You see I have never really been away from home for more than a week, so this is really new to me. It is an experience. One that I know is going to change my life forever. All night I have been thinking of everything and how new all of it is, and it has made me a little scared and nervous. I have even felt a little stressed out about it. And now I have this thought in my head that I won't make it here at UT. But I know that it is just a thought and that all I have to do is adapt to this new change and work my hardest to make it be successful. I have four years here at UT. I plan to make them the best. Besides, I have always loved this school. Ever since I was a little girl this has been my dream school. And now that I am here I am going to make the best of it. I have the pride. I have the spirit. All I need to do is believe in myself and do my very best. UT is the best and I am very glad that I chose to come here. So in all, I guess the way I am feeling is pretty normal for a Freshman. I just need to get the hang of things and everything will be alright. Hook 'em Horns. "
Tell me about yourself.,"It is kind of hard to just do this on the spot like this. Well, let me see. I am thinking about a guy/friend that I have. He is not being very honest with me. It seems like he is trying to trick me into thinking that he is a really nice guy, but I know better now. He is just going behind my back. He got this new girlfriend and we had been going out before and we had agreed to stay friends, which I thought was a really good idea. But now he is trying to leave me hints to his new girl, but he won't just come out and say anything. He is just being really dishonest. Now I am thinking about how bored all of the reader of this project. How you all may have a real problem and I am fixated on stupid stuff. I am sure you that whoever is reading this must thing I am a really big idiot. Well when it comes to problems I am. I can't ever seem to settle things without messing up. It is such a shame that I can be good at stupid things like science, but I can't seem to solve anything without being upset. I guess I am so worried about what the other person thinks that I just ignore the fact that I need to look out for myself too. You know I can't really understand why I need to reveal my thoughts to some complete stranger. I guess it isn't a bad idea because all of this is kept confidential, but it just seems like the people that I have been trusting have be really dishonest, and I am not just talking about the guy I mentioned above. There is a girl who I really got to know this summer, but she was also dishonest. Maybe I am just a really bad judge of character. This would be a lot easier if I could write it down. I wouldn't have to keep backspacing all the time. My fingers are already getting tired and I haven't really been typing that long. My roommates alarm keeps going off. Why doesn't she just get out of bed and make us both happy. I am really a happy person in general. I mean I have my problems just like everyone else, but I am usually pretty pleasant. I must sound like an idiot. Why the hell do I even care what you think? I am never going to really know who you are and you don't know who I am. I mean you have my name and all, but you don't know me. And you can't know me just thought a little writing assignment. I wonder what you guys are going to do with these. I can't really see how you could do a complete project or anything. I guess you all have some reason. You know, I think I should be told what this is for. I mean I am just typing and thinking and I really don't know what this is going to do. La La La La La. Now my mind had drawn a complete blank. I mean I am always thinking; it is just that I am thinking about how there are so many more interesting things to think about. My typing skills have really improved since I have been in college. I mean I used to have to look at the keys, but now I don't; it is really nice. I wonder how that happened. I think that I always knew how to do it, I just didn't trust myself. I mean, it is still more comfortable if I look at the keys and I can go a lot faster, but I make more mistakes. I think that is because when I am not looking at the keys I am looking at the screen and I can see when I mess up. WOW! All of the statements I have made have been so profound. You would think that I would think about things a little more important. Hmmmmmm, like what I wonder. I could think about pollution or racial inequality. Maybe something like the deficit. The thing is I think more people are more concerned about them selves not the problems of the world. I bet the first thing that someone would write would be one of their problems. Ha Ha! Interestingly enough that is what I did. WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE GOING TO DO WITH THESE! I really want to know. I don' t know why it bothers me so much. I think I just need to relax or something. OK, it has been a little over 20 minutes. I am going to go eat something and watch some TV. I hope my brain interested you. "
Tell me about yourself.,"It's been a long day and my head and body are tired. I think that my classes are going well but I feel a little worrisome due to the fact that I have not had a grade taken in any of them. I see people in school and wonder what they are thinking, and wonder why so many people are afraid. They seem scared to talk or to smile or even look up while they are walking this huge campus. With so many people around and the diversity being so big I feel they are missing out and are short changing the rest of their school by not being social. Lately, work keeps awake at night. I always feel as if I have things to do but do feel like doing them. I get upset that my teachers make us read so much. They need to be more hands on to get my attention. Also it seems as if school is not that big of a deal to my friends it bothers me because I don't like school either but I still have to do it. I guess this is what college is all about. The few that do take it seriously are the people that end up doing the best, at least I hope. But what happens to all the people that don't take it seriously. You always hear about those individuals that struck it rich because they didn't follow the norm. I wonder if I'm one of those people. I know that either way I'm lazy so I don't think I'll find out. I miss laura, I think of her a lot and I see her image in a lot of faces. I see curly hair and I imagine her walking, or if I see her figure on a girl I look up to see the face but its' not her. I wish she was here for at least a second. just that one touch of her hand made things better. She always made me laugh and happy. I think I did the same for her, but I still wish she was here with me. love is weird. I think love is something that everybody has with one another and with some it's even stronger. And that strong love is what causes the weird stuff like marriage and so forth. But I wish people would only say love when they meant it. It's used so frequently that now it doesn't have the same affect as it used to. but oh well who really cares. I think laura was the one person who understood what love meant to me, her and my mom both knew. But everybody else thinks I'm weird. Why is a relationship bad to have even if it is long distance isn't that relationship better than not having one at all. I feel that if you really care distance can't stop what the heart feels even if you can't see, touch or hear them. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm realizing, as I begin to write this, that this psychology assignment is probably the weirdest thing I've ever had to do for a class. On one hand, it seems utterly useless, but then again, I know nothing about psychology, so I'm fascinated to find out how they can use something like this for scientific purposes. I just got my wind ensemble music about half an hour ago, and I'm already nervous. I'm also really hungry. I should be meeting Ashley for lunch right now in Kinsolving, but I'm doing this assignment instead. Hope she's not mad. I don't think she will be. Christina wanted to eat over there anyway, and I'd like to try their food, so we'll probably go over there for lunch. Maybe not dinner. I have rehearsal tonight for LHB. Dang it. The last thing I feel like doing right now is marching. It's so hot. I really miss Doug. He's been on my mind every once in awhile, ever since I started school. I don't know why I think about him so much. I've tried to deal with these feelings before, and they've gotten better, but only a little bit. I think of him as a friend, but a part of me still likes him a lot. I don't know why. I should know better. He's the last person I'd ever want to date. But maybe that's why I like him so much, that whole ""opposites attract"" theory. I don't know. Actually, it's not that I don't want to date him, but he has so many qualities that I shouldn't like. When I think about his friendship with Carolyn, it always stirs up jealousy inside me. I know I shouldn't get jealous of her. They were such good friends  more than friends  for awhile, and there's no reason that I should mean as much, or more, to him than she does. I should be happy for them. I love carolyn. She's one of my best friends, but at the same time, she drives me crazy. I don't think she realizes how much it hurts me when she talks about how sweet doug is to her and everything. I wish she'd just make up her mind between him and zag. But the more I think about it, the more I don't miss all that crap from high school. I know there are going to be other guys that I meet  I already have met several in LHB  but it's just that I don't know anyone well yet. There's nobody that I can just talk to, or sit beside and listen to them talk, like I did with Doug. I really miss those times when he'd play with my hair or hold my hand or stroke my cheek. All the times carolyn wasn't around. Weird. No, I need to stop thinking like this. What did my book say? I'm supposed to wait for God to put someone in my life. I shouldn't go chasing after guys (like Carolyn does) because that'll only get me hurt. I try so hard to be good and do what my Christian friends say, but I guess it's that human nature that makes me want to do the other things. I'm really getting hungry now. I think she just finished her calculus, so maybe we can go eat when I'm done with this. I wonder if dad ever found my phone last night. I hope I can remember where I put it, because I really need to have it. I wonder how Matthew is doing with his region band music. I'm so nervous for him. I really want him to beat Brandon. No, I don't. I just want him to get some more confidence when he plays in front of people because he is so good. Well, pretty good, at least. If he had some attitude, or if he didn't get so nervous, he'd be awesome. I wish I could fix it for him. Doug has so much confidence. Matthew needs to be more like Doug. In some ways, at least. I miss me. Nicks, too. Sometimes this whole college thing feels temporary, like I'll go back to school in a week, and everything will be normal, and fun, and stressfree. Jennifer and Jean and Rosie are doing a good job, but there are so many things that I wish they could do differently. Conducting bugs me the worst. Or maybe it's just the fact that they've replaced me. I'm no longer needed at Connelly, and that really bothers me. They might miss me, but they don't need me anymore to keep things running, and it hurts to think about that. Of course, it's kind of nice to be at the other end of the spectrum for awhile, and not know what's going on. Being a freshman is nice, to a point, but then it just drives me nuts. I wish I had a tape player so I could listen to Mr. P's tape. I can't believe wind ensemble is starting tomorrow. I wish I had my car down here with me. I feel so isolated, helpless. I'm homesick, but not really. I just miss Doug, I think. I wish I could've seen him this weekend. I can't wait until I make some good friends here, but all the guys I've met so far are so immature. It's frustrating. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now I'm a little bit depressed, not much has gone my way this week. I made some fabulous friends last week and we were all planning on going home together tomorrow, but now they seem not to want me to go with them. I don't know why everyone is getting mad all of the sudden, maybe it's something in the air. quite ridiculous, if you ask me. I have tears in my eyes as I'm typing, which is strange because I have tried so hard to not let little things get to me. My mom has always told me that I was overly sensitive, I thought I could overcome it, I think I can overcome anything. I had Mono a few years ago, and I overcame that one. My mind has not been forced to think in a while, people that I've talked to are just not to stimulating, I guess I should go and hang out in a coffee shop or something. I always thought college was going to be so much fun, and it's really not. I am this close to packing my bags and going home. Last week, I was the stereotypical college student and now, definitely not. My roommate and I are just not compatible, I mean she's a nice girl and all and she has good intentions, but I find her incredibly dull and childlike. She is a sophomore and I am a freshman. She has a really low self esteem and that's something that I don't deal well with, because I used to too. I don't like to think about those times, because I've overcome them. I fear that she is what I will become and it makes me resent her a bit. I don't want to live the life, or lack thereof, that she is leading. I make my life incredibly competitive, and I like to win. My cousin is down here, she rushed, she's actually in this class. But we've competed with each other all of our lives, whether the other one realized it or not, driving home, getting ready, meeting guys, they were all competitions. She and I are both incredibly stubborn too, so we butt heads quite often. I know that I've changed this year, and she has too, but we've changed differently. She's become more and more dependent on people, she can't be alone at all and I've become more and more independent of folks, for instance tonight, I walked over to the turtle pond and fed the fish, Carrie would freak out if someone told her to do that alone, but I really enjoyed myself tonight, I haven't felt that quiet peace in a long time down here. I don't know if UT is the right place for me, and I don't know. This is ridiculous. I'm here, and I'll graduate from here. Is this the sort of paper you're looking for? My mind is definitely not in a deep ponderous mood. This his how my mind works, worry after worry. I'd rather not get too far into myself here, if that's alright. On a happy note, I saw a guy in my Philosophy class today with absolutely Amazing hair. It was bleach blond and had four inch spikes! I admire people being gutsy enough to do that, never in my life would my hair be in spikes or fuchsia, I'll just stay the way I am. I miss my dog. I talked on the phone to my parents last night and I heard her bark in the background. I am ready to go home that's pretty much what has gotten me through this week. It has been the first time that I've gotten homesick. I think it's because I am going home tomorrow. Before, I didn't get homesick because I didn't allow myself to think about it too much, but I saw a Dallas Morning News today and got all choked up. What is all of this about anyway? Where do I benefit in the long run of living with someone I don't like and being forced to eat bad food? I'd much rather be in my own apartment. HA! My folks would really go for that one. They are so overprotective. The people that I was originally going home with are going to the Dave Matthews concert, and my mom won't let me go, I'm also not allowed to go to the TX v. OU game. That is stinky! I just need a good cry and a good nap and a hug from my grandma and everything will be fabulous again. I swear! If my roommate asks one more time if I want to talk about anything that's bothering me I will scream. I told her already that I'm writing a paper and she is still jabbering. Okay, Deep Breath. Back to Grandma. She is the cutest old lady in the entire world. She is definitely a cookiecutter grandma. It's fabulous. I told her I was coming home and she got so excited! My twenty minutes are up, but I feel much better now, I'm glad I got to take all of my emotion out on this essay rather than on my roommate! I don't know quite how to end my thoughts, even though I am 99. 99% sure that no one will ever read this. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now at this moment I am feeling a little anxiety. I tell myself that this is normal, being a first year student I should feel this way. But the thought does not comfort me. For some reason I feel I am the only one who is going through this right now. I don't feel anxiety all the time though, when I run into friends or go to class it all disappears. My only explanation is that I am comfortable with routine. I hate routine. There is nothing exciting about it, it's just boring. There's no risk in routine or adventure, only security. Maybe that's why I feel so much better when I have work to do or a class to catch. I hope I grow out of this and become more relaxed. The way I see it is that the only way I'm ever going to grow out of this is to get use to the different lifestyle by gaining confidence over time. You can only gain courage towards something as you do it. All I have to do is get over that first hurdle, just do it and not think about the situation for too long. That's my problem; I worry about the future way too much. Worrying is a waste of time and I know that from experience. Half the things I have worried about here at school have turned out to be nothing. But for some reason I still worry, I worry a lot. I have noticed that nothing ever turns out the way you plan in your head. So if I plan on worrying, why do I actually worry? I know there's a good chance it won't happen because I thought of it. I will never enjoy life like this. If this keeps up I'm going to have a problem. I want to go out into the world and totally change something. But I know for sure that won't happen if I don't grow up!. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I can hear my roommate clicking on her mouse as she searches for something over the Internet. She's doing her homework, which, to me, seems overwhelming. It's not like high school where even the hardest classes were easy. They were all just blow off courses to me. I never had to really work because the teachers never really graded. College is different though. It's real. High school never counted for anything, but college can determine your whole life. That is what worries me. I feel that one little screw up can ruin my entire life. I have so many worries, so many fears of the future, of making a wrong turn. Man. I look at it now and run into a corner, trying to hide from it. I remember I use to think high school was important, but it never was. I always felt I wasted my high school years. I should have spent more of it doing things I shouldn't have been doing, not doing things I should have been doing. I could have had more fun, I guess. I did have a lot of friends, though. But, I recently met an acquaintance from high school; he didn't think I had any friends. How sad, I thought. He thought I was a loner and made me name all my friends. I didn't even get through half of them, and he said to stop. It's strange. This is the guy whose motto is don't judge. He judged. Everyone judges, even those who promise they won't. I guess in a way he's a hypocrite, but everyone is a hypocrite. That's what's wrong with this world. Society always makes rules, they tell others don't do something, but yet, they still end up doing it themselves. My friend told me that if evil didn't exist then there could be no good. There would be no standards for good. That's very true, I thought. Everyone would always be on the same ground, and no one could be called a genuinely good person. That wouldn't exist and the happiness from finding one who is actually genuinely good wouldn't exist either. Then there's one less thing to be happy about in this world. We need all we can get. There are to many starving people in this world, too many sick, dying, thirsty. There are always abundances where they aren't wanted and not enough where it is wanted. Like recently, Australia was overcome with huge floods. I remember having to take off my shoes and roll up my pants to walk through a river that wasn't supposed to be there. Dead fish floated in it because the water was so cold. There was too much water there, not enough here. But this memory was happy, nonetheless. It was a strange thing that I would normally not have to do. I stood on the tip of my toes with my gear slung over my back and shoulders and walked carefully as to not step on the mounds of dead fish sitting on the river bend. The fish were sad. They died of cold, but in a way it was fascinating to see them. They were being eaten away by bacteria, and their eyes were huge and black, and empty. Their fins were torn up and gills were opened from the bacteria chewing at them. It was horrible, but at the same time fascinating and wonderful. How strange. I'm so against killing animals, but at the same time, something like this is a magnificent sight. I guess that makes me a hypocrite too. No one can avoid being a hypocrite no matter how hard they try. I say I try not to act on my judgments, but I always do, if not then there could be no opinions, and everyone would be naive. In a way though, I have it better than others, I think. I don't see people when I think of them; instead I see the colors I associate with them. How strange, I always think, but that's how I really do see them. I can never see a person unless I actually try to look at their face and when I do, it's strange. It's not familiar. I looked at my sister's face, and even though I've known her my entire life, I was surprised that is the way she actually looks. How strange. My friends think I'm strange for that reason I think. I can't see a person, I can only see their colors, and when I look at a person, they don't seem like the person I know. Because of this, I never look at people anymore. I forget how they look, but I always remember the feeling they give me when I'm around them and the emotions they stir up. I think this is the best way to think. I'm glad I can't see like I'm supposed to. I always have a layer before real sight, and it's wonderful. "
Tell me about yourself.,"At this moment I am in the FAC computer lab typing away among about 100 other students. Being a freshman, these first couple of weeks have been VERY hard of me. I live at home and commuting, to me at least, isn't a problem. But to other people, it is. They can't believe that I do. They think I have no life, won't make any friends and will be stuck at home my entire life. Which some of that is true. I do have a life, SCHOOL! I'm not going to UT to make friends, I'm paying to go here to get an education and make something of myself. Not to party on the weekends, get drunk, have sex with random people and ""buy"" my friends by joining a sorority. I probably will live at home during my undergraduate career. And why not? I live 15 miles away, why spend $8000 on room and board? I saves SO much money. I have a big family, 7 people. My older sister will be going to Medical school in two years, I plan on law school, my little school wants to be a doctor too and my little brother doesn't know yet. That much education, plus tons of other expenses add up. We could afford to live on campus, but I like my room and bed at home. We're hoping not to take out any loans for all my siblings and mine education, since taking and charging interest go against my religion, Islam. But enough of that. My classes are going well, except for this class, to be honest. I haven't done the reading. Which I better do soon, and I know I will. I've heard James is a good teacher, and I'm a great student, so there shouldn't be a problem. I know most people, especially freshmen, are too busy being distracted and having fun that all they care about is passing the class, or making a B. Which is fine. I really want an A though. Difficult to most people isn't that hard to me, I've always been in AP classes and I can handle working hard, which not a lot of people can, and not a lot of people want to. Besides school though I have two jobs. One at Tinseltown USA, and a box office person, selling tickets. And the other at Kaplan Test Prep, as an student advisor. I hate the latter. I wanted to quit so bad but they begged me to stay since a lot of people are leaving. The managers are SO rude to the students, which is SO wrong because they are paying $1000 to come there. But I only work Sunday, so it's all right. I don't have a boyfriend, which I sometimes wish I did. I want a companion, someone I can always talk to and someone that will listen to me and love me. It's really lonely not having someone like that. There are guys I would date, but either they wouldn't date, they haven't asked yet, or I can't date them. The can't category being one of my managers from work. He is the nicest guy I have ever met in my entire life. He's genuine, caring, goodlooking and funny. He deserves THE BEST. He's only 25, which is 7 years older than me. I'm pretty sure he doesn't have feeling for me, and that's ok. I like the friendship we have now. I can talk to him about whatever I need to and he'll always be considerate about it. I wonder no one has taken him yet? I would if I was ready to get married. I've taken a few weeks off from my theatre job so I don't see him. Twenty minutes has gone by, but I like this. I didn't to clear my head. It's a good thing there is a writing assignment like this. I almost want to keep a journal now, which I've heard is a good idea. I think I'm going to go eat now, and then go to an SI for this class. :) "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm pretty stressed out right now, I just have to get this paper out of the way so I can start on my other 615 hours of homework. What is going through my mind right now, hmmm I haven't called home enough. I've skipped Biology too many times, but I still need an A. I think the teacher is throwing way too much at us for this to only be a 2 hour class. I can get through it though. What is going on in my mind right now?? Actually, I'm thinking I need to think of something interesting to write about so the person who has to read all these doesn't slip into a coma and die. I have a date tomorrow night with a girl that I hardly know, but she was cute enough I don't know what I think about this date thing every weekend, it is getting very old way too fast. How is that supposed to help me adapt to college life. A date is not necessary for every single event, especially when I am dressed up as Country Club Ken (by choice of course). I just heard from someone that this socalled hot date I have has some personal issues. What is that supposed to mean? No one would go into detail, just that she had issues. She could be a bulimic head case for all I know or it could be something simple like she is very into herself. I have a friend who always says that about someone else, but they couldn't describe it. I'm worried about my roommate. He acts strait but every once in a while I catch him staring at me when I get out of the shower. Now that I think about it, it is extremely hard to write about my constant thoughts, because you have to put effort into typing it out, you cannot just think. In class, that is when I can think continuously without interruption, the things that go through my mind in one hour of lecture can begin with some girl I saw looking at me and end up with my thoughts about my first exam next week. There is one good looking girl on my floor that I keep going back to, I winder if she has issues as well. I have been to her room a couple of times, but I can't decide if it could happen or not, I do not like to go for things unless I am absolutely positive she will say yes. Maybe I think about girls too much, but I am a college freshman boy and what else do we think about besides school occasionally and my lack of money by the second week of the month. How in the world does that always happen to me once I get on my own, I could always manage money at home, but the day I moved up here it just disappeared and now I am already left with hardly nothing. People always told me that, but I never listened. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I guess the way I feel right now is overwhelmed. I just came back from a class of 540 students, which is double the number of kids in my whole graduating class. Although there are many students here who are so excited to be away from home and all on their own I wouldn't mind going back home and staying their for a while. I am very pleased with my life at home and this sudden change has left me to start all over. Although I know this is a part of life I feel as thought I am losing some of my childhood friends yet no one is replacing them. At first I told myself that is just how I feel and if those childhood friends felt the same then I might be right but this whole summer all of my high school friends were ready to leave for college. Now that we are all separated we understand how much we depended on each other. I have been here three days and everyday for at least an hour I have talked to my friend back home. I guess what scares me the most is that when you meet someone here you have no idea where they came from, where they have been, or what type of person they are. Back at home we all knew each others families, knew what type of person they where etc. I can truly same that moving to Austin has definitely made me reevaluate myself. Not to be cocky but back at home everyone knew who I was and what type of person I was, but here everyone thinks I am a nobody. I feel as thought I have to impress someone for him or her to approach me where at home others approached me. I guess the comfort of home was my stability and now that I am here I have to build a new foundation to start from. I am very great full that there is one other person from my school here because we are together all the time and it makes this transition just a bit easier. Now that we have started classes I am trying to busy myself with my work, which is, a good thing and then it seem as thought time goes by a lot faster. I think I just have to mental got myself ready for this semester and then I will be fine. I do like challenges and that is why I came to this university but the challenges I expected are not the ones I am having trouble adjusting too. It is completely different aspects of college life that has thrown me off. "
Tell me about yourself.,"The light above my computer is shining so brightly onto the screen. The bright light, almost blinding as I try not to look straight into it. My mind works rapidly as I am trying to focus on my thoughts. Whenever I actually try to think of something my head seems to go blank and I can think of nothing. I guess I don't really think of nothing because the brain is working all the time. There is always some sort of idea or made up story in my head. When I am alone, such as when I walk to class I always daydream about fictional stories or ideal occurrences that I would want to happen in my life. Then I worry that since I thought of it, it would never actually happen like that. I do not believe we can predict the future. Unless dreams are a prediction. Usually my dreams predict nothing and just are a picture in my head of the things I have been thinking about most often. Sometimes they are ridiculous and make absolutely no sense but that could be our imaginations working. I don't seem to get very much sleep. I wonder if that is bad because I am not resting enough and do not have as many chances to dream. I think dreaming is healthy and so much fun when you have a good, inspirational one. Our minds our so interesting. Why do they work the way they do? Will this question ever be answered? Why are people the way they are? It is so interesting to analyze people and their actions but many times I cannot comprehend why they think and act the way they do. Such as when they focus on all the unimportant aspects of life that really have no meaning. It is so special when I can actually find a person that I have a good conversation with. I left all my friends like that and am searching for those people here in Austin. They have to be somewhere, considering there are thousands of people here. Those conversations that leave you feeling in the best mood with a huge smile on your face are the best ones. When you've realized you've shared something amazing with that person or when you were just able to really understand what each other were thinking. Those are the people that leave an impact in my life. Those are the people that moved far away from me and are only reachable by a long distance phone call. These amazing friends are irreplaceable and I am only hoping to find people that come close the type of people I have known. This was something I was kind of worried about when I came here. Would I be drawn into the bubble of people's lives that move in a cycle with no positive direction at all as to who they are going be? Will I be strong enough to keep my attitude, hopes, and feelings about the person I am or want to be? I have found direction, the getting there is the problem. I am actually listening to the song Patience right now and I think it has a good message. This song makes me sad every time I listen to it. It is tied to such strong memories and now especially because I have left many of the people I love. It is hard when I think about this person. I miss them so and my body aches when I think about not seeing them for such a long time. This is maybe one of the hardest parts about college: the fact of moving on and leading a new life with out the people you have loved for so many years. Maybe, but my time is up now, and the rest of my thoughts will only exist in my mind. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now I am sitting in my dorm room. Wondering whether or not I should do this on the word processor. Because this assignment seems so fun that even if the information doesn't get there, I wouldn't mind doing it again. I accidentally just sent you people a blank page because I forgot to scroll down. I really miss home. I have the music on and I keep finding sad music to listen to because it reminds me of my family. I don't think that I will mind this later, but right now, I'm having a bit of trouble adapting to this new life. I am not really too sad, just extremely disoriented. There are only a few people here who I am good friends. Even my boyfriend has changed, and seeing him change (he has been here for three months)makes me wonder how much I will change this year. He even looks different. I think that being in college makes him more attractive, just because he holds himself differently. I wonder if I will look different. I already feel more independent and mature, even though I think that I always have been. Just being away from home gives me a bit of a different perspective on things. People are up here and they are talking about how they are "" independent because they are doing their own laundry""! I sit there thinking ""what! I have been doing my own laundry since I was in 6th grade!"" My parents brought me up, always encouraging me to help myself, meaning that they didn't want me to expect everyone to do things for me. Out of all of my friends, I am the only one whose expenses (personal and what my scholarship doesn't cover) come straight out of my account. My parents don't plan on having to wire me any money this semester, or maybe even the next. I worked this summer and saved my money for that reason. I wanted to make things a bit easier on them. my friends talk about their depleted bank accounts, but even though they worked as well, the only thing that makes use of their money is anything that revolves around their personal interests (aka shopping) I had to buy my own books, a good three hundred dollars that I could have used for something else, even though I probably would have just saved it all, because I love the feeling of having money. It is not just the security, but the feeling of accomplishment, and feeling like I am not just throwing away my money on material things. Even though I always want to shop and I always see things that I want, I never indulge because I feel like if I start I won't be able to stop. But seriously, I really do want some more clothes because I recycle the same shirts in a matter of a week and a half. That could also have something to do with the unbearable heat. It was 113 degrees the other day and I have four hours between classes. By the time I get back from my first two classes, I already feel all icky, so I change shirts. Oh, today I went inside a sorority house. I don't really understand what the difference is between a dorm wing and a sorority. After all, they are essentially the same thing. You get food and shelter and you get to meet a lot of people. It is up to you to build that ""sorority"" with the people in your wing. But I think the same kind of relationship is possible for girls who are living in the dorm. Speaking of girls, when my boyfriend moved up here, he and his roommate became friends with this girl who I don't like. She is over at their apartment day and night because her friend lives in the same complex. My boyfriend thinks that she is really funny, and I know that he thinks she is pretty because he told me so. It seems like they have more in common than we do. I am a really jealous person and I am really jealous of her. I feel like she is better in every way than I am. She is taller and prettier. And he laughs at her so much. My boyfriend cheated on me once in the very beginning of our relationship, with his exgirlfriend. I think that by nature I am already a jealous person, (WOW Pepsi One is really gaseous because I never burp and this is the first time I have ever tasted it. I just burped out of nowhere) where was I? oh yeah. since he cheated on me it is really hard to trust him. So far he has betrayed my trust but I can't help but forgive him because I feel so much for him. I always looked down on people, girls, who let guys walk all over them. And even though it may seem like that is what's happening, that is not the way I see it. I don't no why. I know that it sounds really naive, but I feel like we are different. Now I know that you should not judge people or assume things about them until you have been in their position. I know that I have been talking for more than twenty minutes, and I really don't like thinking about these boyfriend crises, even though I do it more than I should. Anyway that is the stream of my consciousness. "
Tell me about yourself.,"This is very odd trying to track my thoughts by doing this. All I can think of right now is I can't type as fast as I think. I am slow at typing in general but this makes it even harder. So lets see what do we talk about. Today I have a long day cause I have four classes and I don't get home until late. Mondays and Wednesdays are my longest days. Anyways, this weekend my goal is to be caught up with all my reading and all the things I have to do for my classes. I have been enjoying college so far but I don't like the work aspect of it. There is just so much reading and constant memorizing and remembering it. It wasn't like this in high school but then again I am not in high school anymore. Let's see what else. My roommate spelled rice all over our room carpet just a minute go and now the room smells like Chinese food. She cleaned it all up but now the rug is greasy. So after I finish typing I will clean the carpet so it's not so greasy anymore. I am looking at the clock and I only have been typing for 5 minutes. I am tired already of this. I am looking at my little cousins' pictures right and I miss them very much. It's lonely here in college but I am working on having fun. But there doesn't seem like a whole lot to do that doesn't involve alcohol in some way. Everyone seems to just want to get junk and pass out and not even remember what they did the night before. I am not much of a drinker and certainly not to the point of getting junk and passing out. I like to just go out with friends and hang out and talk like we used to, but most of my friends are so spread out that we have to do the email thing for now. I like email because its' just wonderful. There are no long distance charges and you can send it in a second to anyone anywhere in the world. Oneday people are going to not be able to remember their lives before email. I don't even think they can now. I still can because I was just a freshman in high school when it first started getting popular. But I still like the days when we were not so technology driven. I like the later 80's and early 90's. Though I am not that old I can still remember those times where things didn't seem to be so fast paced. And now everyone is trying to be millionaire and wanting more and more of material things and just wanting to have a ""good time"" and not really caring in depth about things and people. Its just use and get ride of the next day. But then again there are other people who don't do this. I don't know. Now I am looking at the clock and seeing that I have been typing for fifteen minutes now and my fingers are getting really tired. I am glad I ate before I did this cause then I really would have been annoyed with this. Looks like it's going to be another hot day. I want it to cool down but I don't want it to rain when we have to go to class. It can rain on the weekend but not while we have to go to class cause that would cause more headaches. Anyways, I just want to be home right now. I want to be in my car and drive to the mall or just whatever. I miss being at home and I didn't get much of a summer this summer cause I was so busy preparing for college and making a list of things to buy and packing, and going and being in camp and just lots of stuff that I needed some more time of relaxation and enjoyment. Will I have about one more minutes of typing so I guess this is it. I don't know what I am even saying. Oh there I hit the 20minute mark ok I am going to stop typing now, goodbye. "
Tell me about yourself.,"This assignment seemed so easy at first, but now that I am actually writing it, it is hard to find something to write about. I thought that would spend a little time telling you about my first few days at The University of Texas. I come from a very small town, and all my life I have dreamed of living in a very big city. So around my junior year in high school I began looking at different schools and one of them happen to be here. Well I have been to Austin before, but I never got to really go on campus. As I stood on the south mall and saw the capital, I knew this was the place for me. I had a big city and a big school all rolled into one. As the big day got closer and closer, I began to chicken out. I didn't want to leave home, but most of all, I didn't want to leave my family. I wasn't for sure that I could move six hours away not knowing one single person. Everyone told me that I would never make it on my own because I was too much of a ""mommy's girl. "" This is when I knew that it was time to grow up and take another big step in my life. The ""moving day"" finally arrived and I was scared, but very excited. I decided to go through rush. I needed some kind of activity to keep me busy and this was perfect. My family got me settled in and two days later they were gone. I was very surprised that I didn't shed a tear that day, and two weeks later I still haven't looked back. I haven't even been homesick yet. My roommate is having a hard time, though. We didn't get along at first, but I think everything will work out fine. She calls home a lot crying, and sometimes that is kind of hard on me, but I hope to help her through this tough time. Other than a few small bumps in my road, I am having the time of my life. I will admit all of this is a huge change for me, but sometimes change is just what a person needs. Somehow, everything has just fallen in place for me, and I hope it will remain this good for the next 4 years. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am residing at Castillian for my freshman year. I have my own personal room, which is more than I can say for others. It is very nicely furnished with all of my personal possessions from home. The entire back wall is a large window with a beautiful view of the hills. All the lights can be seen twinkling, which causes a serene atmosphere and a pleasant way to relax. My parents are paying a small fortune for my to stay here as well as for all of the other things I'd like to do. They try so hard to make me happy, but I'm not. I feel a sense of debt to them to succeed in college. I also believe that this was their full intention. We'll call it a bribe. They spit out money as long as I do well. This shouldn't be a problem for me considering grades have always been important to me, and I myself would like to succeed as best I can. The bribe, however, is the problem. I'm cracking, although that term doesn't quite seem to fit my feelings. Dissolving in a container of sulfur dioxide seems to better fit the description. Everything engulfs you at once and slowly eats you away. Your struck with shock and you can no longer feel the pain. You can always try and get out, but since you are dissolving, everything you aim for slips through your fingertips. I have studied numerous hours to ensure myself the proper background for each of my subjects. I go to every discussion session and can explain anything that has been taught in class or the first chapter of each book. When it actually comes to turning something in, however, minute mistakes always seem to add up. Already after the first day of class, I have messed up terribly on homework. I am incredibly stressed out and seeing the results of this assignment (though it's not for a grade nor does the professor use it for anything) made me more miserable. In fact, it actually brought me to tears. An assignment that means nothing to anyone (except obviously me) brought me to a ranting rage and then tears. I see myself as pathetic because I failed myself and because I can crack so easily. I can't say that my classes are overwhelming, though they take up from 9  7 with a one hour lunch break each day. If I had to guess, I would say that I was unsure of everything. I'm unsure of friends, family, boyfriend, classes, grades, time, money, and so much more. On top of this, I'm left for the first time in my life to attempt at juggling all of these things around at once. I'm sure it will all level out in the end and that I'll eventually get the swing of things. As of now, however, I feel like a mere speck amongst better people who are sure of so many things. I only wish I wasn't born with the disease of being manic depressive (and that my grandmother in France hadn't died last week). It only seems to complicate things. Also, as we said in class, stress can bring about depression and visaversa. Perhaps that is playing a slight role in my emotions. All I know is that it seems so much right now. "
Tell me about yourself.,"ok. I've finally made it here! you know, I had always thought that once I got to college, the stressful life I once knew back in my home town of Conroe would no longer exist. well, I was so terribly wrong! however, though I am completely busy every second of every day, it's been a blast! yesterday for example: I woke up bright and early at 6:30, had class from 910 and 1011, came back to my beautifully decorated dorm in Jester west and tried for like an hour to get to this page which I later found out was down at the time, then, briskly ran to my philosophy class which lasted from 12, after which I tanned, went back home again to brush my teeth and wash my face before my psy. class (yours!) from 3305. once class was over, my friend johnna and I proceeded to take the long hike back to jester in the rain! (yay!) there, I ate my first meal of the day pot roast! mmmmm. next, I had to walk all the way over to my parking spot on trinity where because I needed to get some clothes my dad brought down for my some time last week that have just been sitting in the trunk of my car getting all wrinkled and nasty. rather than walk back with two armfulls of clothes, I decided to drive back. after the laundry was hanging safely in my tiny closet, I took it upon myself to fight the 630 Austin traffic over to my grandparents house off of Lamar where I was instructed all week by my mother to take my car so it could get a new inspection sticker. while in traffic, I happened to notice that my sticker would not be out of date until November! this was particularly angering to me because tonight from 912 or so, I was to attend a mixer with my pledge sisters and the pledge members of sigma ki and instead of having just a few moments to myself before I had to take another shower and proceed to get ready, I was cooling my heels in a traffic jam for a car inspection sticker that wasn't necessary at the time. however, once at the grandparents house, I did stock up on some much needed food and beverage products. now, I am finally back and I have all of 10 minutes to sit on my floor, watch a little tv and eat some Reesesmini cup. after that, I quickly got ready for the nights planned activity. the party actually turned out to be pretty fun except for the fact the Austin police made two appearances! luckily, neither me or any of my sisters had formal charges brought against them. ok enough of that. only about 6 minutes left and I still have so much to say! let's talk about the future I want to live in a loft apartment in new York city with huge, towering white walls, bay windows, and blackandwhite checkered tile in the kitchen. I hopefully will be an established poet. also, I would like to have a successful career as a professional buyer. now, this job would be just too great for me all day long, I would be able to shop! my clientele would range from movie stars to the rich who haven't the time, or fashion sense, to dress and style themselves. ah! my time here is up! thank you and I hope you have enjoyed the show:)and remember kids: carpe' diem! "
Tell me about yourself.,"Ok. what I am going to write about for twenty minutes? What is on my mind? Elizabeth and I really need to get to work on getting a place to live next year. I can't believe that we have to decide in September on something practically a year away. I mean, so much can happen in a year. I think that all the girls we are going to live with are pretty cool, so there shouldn't be any problems. But, then again, I have known them for about a week, so how can I already know what it would be like to live with them for an entire year?? This is just a crazy system. Everyone here seems to be worried about things so far in advance. who is going to be my date for the game a month from now?? I don't like always worrying about the next thing. I want to enjoy what I have now. Right now I have a few hours to just relax and get some muchneeded rest. But, as soon as my mind gets to work, I start thinking about things I need to have done. The big talk here right now is the OU game and who everyone is going with. This is just ridiculous. the game isn't for almost a month and people are acting like this is some huge ordeal. If everyone would just relax and stop trying to plan everything out for the next year, than things would be a lot calmer around here. Well, I am tired about worrying about all that stuff. I've got plenty of things that have to be taken care of right now like getting ready for my chemistry test and getting a decent night's sleep for the first time in 2 weeks. I also need to figure out when a good weekend is to go to Baylor and cheer up Holly. It is so hard to talk to your best friend on the phone and just be able to hear the pain and loneliness in her voice. I just don't know what to say to her anymore. I feel like I have done everything I can to help her realize that it is going to take some time. I feel so guilty telling her about all the fun we are having because I know she is having such a hard time, but she does not want to talk about it. I spend so much time worrying about her, and there isn't anything I can do for her while I am here in Austin. I tried to tell her that she is going to have to be more outgoing and force herself to meet new people. She just isn't the most outgoing person. Once you get to know her, you would never think of her as shy; it just takes a while for her to let you into her world. I hope that she can stay positive and learn to open up It would help her a lot. Man, it is so loud here, my train of thought just got completely interrupted. Where was I?? Oh yeah, Holly. I think that I have run out of encouraging words for her, and in a way I feel like I have failed her as a best friend. I mean. aren't I supposed to be able to cheer her up and make her feel better about any situation?? I am at a loss. Well, I guess I should try and take my mind off of that until there is actually something I can do about it. I am exhausted and I really just want to go to bed, but I have so much work to do. It was just too tempting to lie in bed all day and not get any work done. Now I am going to be up so late getting all my reading done. And doing that is pointless because I am so tired that in the morning I won't remember a word that I read. This is just so different from anything I expected and it is going to take a lot of discipline to keep up with everything that I have to do. Ok, twenty minutes is up. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, I'm listening to music right now and just relaxing. I'm about to start studying for Chemistry and Psychology so I do have a bit of work to do tonight. In Chemistry I need to do the homework and also the work for the discussion session. I'm almost done with the psychology chapter I've been reading all week. It's the most interesting book I've been reading, followed by biology, then chemistry. All of it kind of ties in together though which helps out a lot. Today I met a lot of people from my freshman interest group, which is kind of nice because I haven't met many people due to me living in an apartment. My phone line finally came in today after a week of waiting so I'm just now able to get on the internet, which I've sorely missed. It was pretty tiring moving all of my roommates and my furniture to our apartment because we're on the third floor. I have enjoyed school a lot more than usual so far, probably because it is actually interesting compared to high school. I'm glad someone picked up my shift at the Outback tomorrow to give me more study time, and also it helps because my car is in the shop and it was going to be hard to leave psychology at 5 and be dressed and ready for work at 6, especially without a car. I want to do the pretesting for the psych labs but the net is giving me a broken link. Oh well, I guess I'll do it later and maybe it will be fixed. I just got everything in my apartment organized today. I bought some hanging folders for all of my handouts, which are really helping, and other various organizers. I kind of like this assignment, I'm doing work but it's over what I'm thinking at the time and let's me see my thoughts. It's kind of like a recap of the day, because that's mainly what's on my head. Hopefully tomorrow I'll wake up on time considering that this morning I woke up at 9:10 and had to high tail it to my chemistry class by 9:30. Oh well, it's been about 20 minutes so I'm going to go ahead and study now for my classes. It was fun. "
Tell me about yourself.,"At the present time, I am content to be writing. It's almost time to go to sleep, and this is very relaxing. I am listening to eminem on mtv. I do not like eminem. I hate to cough. I am coughing because of this stupid dorm room and some studid mold that they think is just the paint doing wierd things. I think that my throat is doing better though, the medication is kicking in finally after about 6 days of torturous soreness. I just talked to Jonathan, he is the greates guy in the world. But i don't want him to think that I am the only girl in the world for him. I think that it is funny that a lot of girls thought are about boys. I just want to have fun this year, and not have a boyfriend. I think it is important to just meet people and have connections with each person you come in contact, but they don't have to be any thing more than at that moment. Its really late, I wish that I wouldn't put things off till the last minute. I have had such a long day, and am ready for bed. My bed feels so good. I love the fact that I am so comfortable in my dorm with my roomates. They are so great, and fun to be with. Chaps is my roommate. I think that name is kind of different, but she like it so I just call her that. I love this song by Michelle Branch. She ironically is talking about saying goodbye to a boyfriend.  That is what I have had to do for the past year. It was incredibly hard. But I hated the way he acted when he left for college my senior year. I felt so guilty for wanting more out of my senior year than having a boyfriend 300 miles away. He wanted more, and I feel so bad. He has some self-confidence issues. I think the fact that I actually was dating him was great for the self - confidence thing. But once we separated, it just hit him so hard. We are really good friends, but I really think he still wants more. Someday, I might also, but not now. I love that the Zeta's symbol is the strawberry and the queen. It is so exciting. I am so excited about organizing my New Member book. I love organizing. It almost gives me some kind of high. To be totally organized, and know where everything is. I need that kind of stability in my life, because I do so much and stretch myself in so many difections. I don't know how I am going to do Sororities, get my GPA up to at least a 3. 8, and do two organizations outside of school, (which is required by Zeta sorority). But I perform best under pressure, so the more the merrier. I am so excited about Texas Spirits, that is the organization that I hope to join, as my organization to have to join. Jessica is in Texas Spirits, and I love her. She was the person that made my decision for Zeta Tau Alpha so concrete in my mind. I dreamed that I was a Zeta the night before i found out which one picked me. I think it was a sign or something. Jessica means so much to me, but she is always too busy with Katie Johnson. Today, she did give me a card with a picture of us in it saying that she is sorry she hasn't been there to hang out with me as much as she wanted to. Zeta is going to be so awesome to be a part of. I love the friends that I have made so far. I just really think that the parties that are involved are a little too numbered throughout the week, I mean they want us to get good grades, and be in all these organizations. Yet they give us all these mixers to go to to meet people which I love to do, but they are on week nights. Oh well, I just am going to have to limit my participation in them. I miss my high school friends. I haven't talk to Rosie in ages, and Casey didn't even say goodbye before she left. I am going to have to send them an email pretty soon. The sound of the mouse and keyboard are such wierd noises. And so are the sounds that come out of the actual computer. I always have wondered what makes the little clicking noises in the computer. I mean is it gears shifting, or electrons being shot out of some kind of machine. I want to know. That is interesting. And I am glad to be done.        "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well. steam of conscience you say. Well as you will sonn learn by reading this I have a very random stream of conscience. I tend to jump from one thought to the next without warning. Now some may call that ADD but I personally think that it is due to my intellect. I have always gotten descent grades in school and when i apply myself i get all A's, i just lack that thing called motivation. But i think that i am starting to gain it once again becuase of the fact that i don't know what i want to do with my life so i have to have good grades in order to transfer into the school of my choice. I'm actually looking at the psychology department as well as business. Big surprise right?  I just looked up and saw a picture of my absolutely gorgeous girlfriend Lauren. Everything with her and i is great. other than the fact that she is still in hight school and living in houston. (by the way that is where i am from). She is great. We get along all the time and she actually has the ability to make me a better person, where as no one else that i have ever dated has had to ability to change me in the slightest way. I think that was because i never really cared about any of them even if i did say that i loved them. (you do what you have to do sometimes. . you know what i mean?)   Back home i was a member of the high school band. REally neardy sounding im sure but what can i say. Thats where i met lauren though and if you saw her you wouldnt be saying that. But anyway that is where some of my fondest memories have come from. I have continued with the whole band thing in collage. My brother was in it for four years before i got here and talked it up to be this great miracouls thing but now that i am in it i am kind of wondering what all the who ha was about. I mean i love the music end and the free games are nice but other than that i am kind of lacking interest. PLEASE IGNORE THE SPELLING ERRORS i am a horrible speller. I depend on the spell check. Well i just looked around my room at a poster of Brooke Burke that my roomate has on his wall. It makes me wonder if Lauren is the only person that i will ever have sex with and weather i am doing myself a bad thing by not getting out and experiencing things. I mean i have been with her the last 10 monthes. don't get me wrong  I LOVE HER and could never dream of hurting her, but i have to wonder what it would be like to be single in college. That alos makes me wonder weather i should feel guilty when i check out other girls as they walk by on the street or when i have   thougts   when watching a movie or things of that nature. Man Brooke Burke is hot.   I guess i am kind of feeling the   freshman symptons   that eveyone talks about. I miss being at home with my family. See i have never been to a church service or anything like that. I was raised on the principle of family. Which i love and that is what i know but i have to wonder weather or not im missing something by never have gone to a service. My family is jewish. Both my parents practiced when they were young and even when they were older, but once my mom's dad died (my grandfather) my mom stopped practicing because she did not understand why God would take such a good man a such a young age when there was a bitch of a mom (my grandmother) who deserved nothing that she had. So as you can see my mom has some issues with God and her mom. But this never being taught religion always leaves me with a void. I don't know weather i believe in a God or not. All i know is that i look at things logically and if there is not a logical reason for an action i have to wonder what is going on. Wow 17 mins. don't know if it really feels long or not but either way i have to fill 3 more mins.   Looking to the future i need to start looking for some gifts for Lauren because her birthday and our 1 year anniversary is coming up. Which is a big deal cause i never lasted more than 3 monthes with anyone else. Just another sign of how special lauren is to me. BUT more importantly my bday is coming up nad i hope to be getting a digtal camera so tha i can recorde the many addventures of collage.   Well times up so i guess i will be going.    "
Tell me about yourself.,"    hehe. . wow you do have a timer on this page, I heard that you didn't, or that you could write for like 10min and then just hit submit and it would work, and I thought to myself   wow. . how hard would it be to make a script to auto submit it after 20minutes are up    Its really lame tho that you didn't give us some sorta topic to start out on, I mean, I find it easier to conciously recognize my thoughts when they are focused on a general topic. That prolly doenst make alot of sence, but basically I'm a big person into mind over matter stuff, metaphysics, multideminsional self, acension, and usually and am in close contact with my thoughts, but usually when in a trance state or meditation, not while acually creating kenetic energy(moving physcially). I'm listening to my speakers right now. . I love tool's music, its so euphoric and conductive to a meditative state. sorta like how trance music sorta makes you tired after listening to it for 20 min or so. Yeah, now you prolly think something about trance == drugs or something. But no. I don't drink, do drugs, I'm a vegetarian, and like to keep my body in a good state. Wow my computer case is dirty. I need to get a towel or something and clean it off. I wish I had a new motherboard/processor and more ram for it too. Which reminds me I need to build a linux server soon. . I've got the parts just not the time becaues I'm too busy writing programs for my cs classes. Taking 17 hours is ok. wish I had more. . like 1-2 more. it keeps me busy, which I like. I want to do research in metaphysics. Isn't weird a cs/math double major wanting to do research in the area of metaphysics which has no real basis physically?  I got a good base in logic tho which really helps. My gf is coming up here this weekend, from dallas. Shes' at NT right now cause shes in tams and I miss her, it'll be fun. oww my hand hurts from typing or something. I like being able to close my eyes and just type it makes it easier to concentrate on my thoughts. I still taste the cheese on my tounge. I had cheese and crackers earlier and it was good. thirsty. . yay tea  I like my cell phone, I saw my cell and it made me think that. unlimited night/weekend is awesome. Music:   duh duh duh duh   end song move to bad religon. . ehh. . I guess it can sit there for now. hmm. . been 11min so far. about half done. I like this tho. well not so much the writing for stream of concouisness but the premiss behind it. analizing thoughts see what people are like and stuff. . its nice. thinking I would do a triple major in pphilosophy if I can get a job to pay for my classes that go over 150 hours. wow there is a big purple mark on my arm where I rest in on the edge of my   desk:    its not a real desk, more a shelf in my aparment designed to act as a desk. I like my apartment so much better than dorms,  room by myself, and cheaper. Got housemates tho. but its still better. I wonder what tristan is doing at college station (old roomate). I've lacked seeing him online. music  resist and multiply   . . thats incubus. there ok but latest album is the worst they've done. grr I need to do more streching, I've lost my flexiblity, and I need to work out more,  just got to make myself move awayt from my phone and just surfing online when nothing better to do. they have a gytm over here in my apartments. wonder where it is. I need to find out. mainly want to work on abs pecs and left trapiezius all but pecs aI can do here in my room with my dumbbell so not that big a rush  &lt;moving to music&gt;  &lt;singing in head to redhot chili pepper&gt; I like my speaker system. sound card and speakers where bout 50 total which is nice for how they work. . not top of the line but better than anything else I prolly could of got for the same. hmm. . my joints in my fingers like to pop, and my knees sometime. I'm siting weird, or what most people would consider weird. basically enjoying my flexibitliy and light weight so that I can stay in strange positions and be comfortable. I usta sleep in class in weird positions. . I had to fight to stay up in logic this morning. but I made it. . so yay. I watn a 4. 0 this sem so staying up is all good. I shoudl be able to cause I'm working harder than any time before. . hmm. . its ddone now. . bye bye "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am thinking about an email I just read. It's from a friend from a      kickboxing class. He was giving me a hard time, Which is fine because I make fun of him too. He's a pretty funny guy but I am really trying to come up with a good joke to really bust his chops. I am also thinking about  how depressed everyone is today, being September 11th and all. I wonder how Sept. 11th will be in like 50 years. I also wonder how long it will take for it to get into student's text books. I hope they don't do the same thing that they did for Pearl Harbor and Titanic, and make a love story out of it. That's rediculous, there is more to it than some guy going off to work while his wife is at home and his lover is at his secret apartment. I bet a lot of people will be angry if someone manages to come up with one. I would hate to be President Bush now. He has some tough decisions to make. Half of the country says: Kill 'em all! While the others are screaming:   PEACE.   No matter what, someone will not get what they want. Even in the West Mall today, there are tons of people speaking their opinion, showing signs and passing out ribbons. But it's not totally black and white. I think there is a grey area. Some people say war and some say peace, but I think we can find some in-between. Killing innocent children isn't a good idea but we have to stand up for ourselves if we want this to stop. I don't know. . I don't like talking about politics or religion. Too much controversy. Everyone is too stubborn to see the sides of others. I am also thinking about when I was here in the computer lab yesterday. Some girl started crying really loud in the hallway. It was just like out of the movies. None of us knew what was going on. Some people got up and went to see, which (although curious myself) I thought was rude. I went to my kickboxing class last night. It really makes me feel self-confident. Learning those moves last night was a lot of fun. Why isn't the time and minutes thing doing anything? I am afraid that I will have to do this all over again. I am looking around the room and noticing that just about everyone here is checking their email. I guess no one does work on computers!!!  I like coming in here to check my email but I always feel like someone is reading what I am typing behind me. If they want to know so bad, they should just ask. I am very tired. I went to bed late, and slept through my alarm. But somehow I still made it to my 9:00 class. Barely! That class is fun. Learning sign language is very important I think. Just as important as learning Spanish or French or something. Going to the social events will be sort of weird though. Since I am not very good at signing, I will pretty much be a wall flower.    "
Tell me about yourself.,"I have no idea wher to begin. Im sitting in my dorm and the sound of th a. c. and the fans is driving me crazy. Its like either be hot or be completely annoyed. Besides that, I have twenty different other things on my mind. Am I going to bo to the SI session tonight or am I just going to study so I can go out tonight? Should I even go out tonight? I feel so nervous all the time that Im not using my time wisely. I don't feel at home in this dorm yet so its hard for me to have an organized lifestyle that I am comfortable with. I am so hungry but if I take the time to eat I could be taking time out of other things and I still have another 15 minutes to write so I really can't stop to eat yet. Mainly food is on my mind along with allthe other things I still need to do. It seems like it never ends. Its wierd because when I am studying I feel so enlightened by learning things and I also feel like I am getting a lot accomplished but when I am not studying no matter what the reason, I feel like I am wasting time or getting behind. I wish I could know where I stand compared to the other students as far as knowledge and studying goes. I am so tired and overwhelmed and excited all at once about everything that my mind is going crazy. This whole writing thing is also making me crazy because at times I can't think of what to write and I feel like I have to be constantly writing. Peolpe keep calling my cell phone and I want to answer it but I don't want to loose my train of thought but I guess that doesnt matter because as long as I write what I am thinking its ok but whatever. I keep worrying that the thinking that the things I am writing are making me sound depressed and that along with prof. pennebaker saying that most college students are depressed really disturbs me because I am not one to be depressed and it doesnt sound very fun. I feel really bad that I am ignoring these phone calls because i always seem to ignore the person who is calling. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     lets begin. how to begin. . this is a start. a start of something undetermined. not like a coefficient. not even a matrix. although its being stored physically in memory in a linear fashin which if you dumped it to a screen it would wrap and may appear as a matrix; not like the movie. just plain ordinary hexadecimal digits; boring to the average person. or at least what i percieve to be average; this is by experience, my experince which is limited. im hingry err hungry. perhaps i just coined a new word. i should copywrite it and charge people a rediculous sum of money whenever its used. id be financially secure. no problems paying tuition in the future. everything would be perfect. well not really, that was sarcasm. what else. . bordom is begining to set in. hmmm what happened today?  well, i went to skewl and learned a few new tricks. no, i am not a dog. or a cat or mouse or flea. i had a dog when i was young though and some fish. never had a pet aligator; though they are common in the sewers in some parts of houston, my hometown. that place is awfull. funny have awe full -- which is used to describe something good -- is so similar to awfull. yadda yadda yadda hocus pocus and a bunch of other filler words go here. the oven is finished preheating. i thought i'd be lazy and eat pizza tonight. unfortunately i have to wait about 13 minutes until i can put it in the oven. if i left the computer now id be cheating wouldn't i?  who am i asking. 1. instructor, 2. teachers assistant, 3. myself, 4. some imaginary diety. hmmm undecided. well no, myself. am i vain?  not often do i think of myself as such but everything is untimately relative to me, i can only imagine what others think and feel and experience. oh well insert more garbage here. is the audience bored yet?  can they tell im bored. prolly so. i forget to tell stephanie that riley called. hopefully ill remember later when she gets home. i think i forget to tell her last time he called to. this is not good because he still needs to resolve some things with here. he is young. im old. getting older, but not as old as dirt. how old is dirt anyways?  will it ever evolve into something else? we'll make great pets. i never went to lalapalooza. sister did, car broke down and so they hitched a ride the rest of the way there. crazy dangerous and fun all at the same time i suppose. i usually play things safe which result in alot of missed opertunities. at least i think so. but this is not as true as it used to be. some of my friends think im a bit strage. sometimes truth is stranger than fiction. bad religion. from the grey race i think. my best friend in high skool was a big fan of them. i fooled around with his girlfriend one night and have regretted it ever since. told him the next day about it. he was glad, he wanted rid of her anyways. funny how things work out sometimes. my grammer is horrible. hagar the horrible wasa comic i read in the newspaper when i was little. hocus focus was my favorite though. i remember easter at my grandmothers and getting stung by a wasp. meat tenderizer in a wonderfull thing. a1 sauce not equals meat tenderizer. i like c. its for cookie and is a bad ass programming language. maybe i spend to much time staring into electron guns. crts have got to be bad for my vision. maybe that why i need contact. laser surgery sounds pretty good. still the long term effects are unknown. whats the worst that could happen?  my eyes fall out of their sockets and i have to put ping pong balls in there instead?  my friends could call me muppet man!  i really do find that amusing. a bit morbid, but amuzing nonetheless. 2 minutes to go until this assignment is done. then i can put the pizza in the oven the wait another 20 minutes til i can eat. please don't feel guiltly for making me wait. humans can go for a few days without food or so i am told. i do not known from experience. still i am hungry. the hunger is a band i never saw play in concert. i did see lucious jackson. that was great fun. i had a shiney dead fish toy that everyone liked. the band kept looking at it while they played on stage with a confused look on their face "

BUT UNTILL THEN, I MUST CONCENTRATE ON EVERYTHING. EVERYTHING. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     what classes do i take next semester?  i need to plan out the rest of my college coursres out today. can i do it?  is it too much for me?  i think i can do it. i am completely capable of being admitted into medical school. thus far, i know that that is what God has in store for me, and what he thinks I should do now. there are so many people out there that i want to reach out to and help. i can not wait until my missions trip to russia. it wil be an awesome experience. everytime i think of all the people and children I will be helping i get a warm, tender, and comforting feeling in my heart. i think that God has given the gift of helping and taking care of others. for an extended period of my life i have always tried to find the meaning of my life, what special characteristics i possess but now i do not ponder on those things. i know that God has blessed me with several things and I am truly grateful. i hope that i can get involved with a good church here, and find a really nice cell group to join. i miss houston, newlife, house church. i wish that i could have stayed in houston and went to school there but i believe that i am where i belong. even though i may not like it here, i know that it is for the best. i believe that i will receive the best education i need for my profession in the future. plus, who knows, I may get more involved in church here in austin, and that may be another reason God has brought me here. nevertheless, i am determined to work far and beyond to be able to do my job. i am so tired today. i feel very tired but i can not seem to go back to sleep. it seems like every second is precious and i do not waste it by sleeping, atleast during the day. i am so nervous. it is only the third day of school and i am already stressing out. i think that i need to lighten up a little. my sister is right. i worry about things too much. i should just be easy-going but not too easy-going, i do not want to be carefree about everything. i am very thankful that i have naeri and my sister here. since i do not know many people in austin, it helps to atleast have one or two people i can talk to once in a while. i want to meet new people but the people here seem too immature for me. i am not really into the clubbing, drinking, etc. but then again there are so many students here, and i have only met the people that are into that because the people that i know are, so i just tag along. i am pretty sure that i will meet numerous people that share the some interests and aspects as i do. but i do not mind being alone. i think i am pretty independent exept for the fact that my parents my tuition but other than that i feel pretty independent. and, i also work and communicate well with others.  "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well i am beginning this assignment and already I'm worrying about spelling errors and constantly hitting backspace trying to fix every little thing. Sometimes I wonder why I care about that stuff but I really don't know, and  my mind just wonders endlessly all the time, which I why I think I will enjoy this assignment, once it has been evaluated, because I seem to conjure up the wildest ideas, and thoughts and feelings when I begin to let my mind roam free. Now I'm thinking why am I thinking about my thinking which seems really weird, but I guess thats the idea of this experiment, and I am constantly trying to think about what to think about next, so that I'll have something to type, instead of leaving a blank screen which would be bad, because then I would get a bad grade, even though the grading system on this particular paper is based on completion, not on content, which is a good thing because if it was based on content, and I had no content, then there would be nothing to grade, and I would have bad grades, and now it just occured to me that I am rambling on about nothing, and making fallacious points as I type, just for the simple reason to keep typing, which is the main goal of this experiment, and I just heard my roomate coughing in the living room, he is foreign, and sometimes hard to understand, but I think it's cool to have a foreign exchange student as a rooomate because it adds a bit of variety to the mix, and he said that his parents live in Yugoslavia, and that he moved here with his host parents who lived in Pennsylvania, but had to move here to Austin for job reasons, which is why he lives here, and which is why he goes to Austin Community College, and I know this because I asked him, and I asked him because I was curious to know about his background due to the fact that he is from a foreign country. He says he likes it here in   the states   as most foreginers refer to us as, but he, like most teenagers, misses his friends back home, which is why he goes back there every summer to visit, and I guess since he has lived both places, and experienced both cultures and economies, is why he chose to major in International Business, and my other roomate, Troy, is a business major at UT, and I am somewhat of a business major, with my major being Sports Management, which is in the College of Education because it is a branch of Kiniesiology, which I don't know if I spelled right, but I supposed I should learn how,  but anyways my major is more of a business major, like Troy and Djordje, which is pronounced George, so that makes 3 business majors in the house which can be helpful at times, then I have another roomate named John, whom I have been friends with since 4th grade when his mom babysitted me, and my mom told his mom that she doubted we would get along because we were two different types of people, but she was wrong because even since his mom moved to Nebraska with him, and his sister Lynnsie, we stayed friends, and then his dad who lived in Houston at the time, moved to San Antonio when I was in 7th grade, yet we still remained best friends, though we only saw each other 4-5 days a year. I figure there is some psychological aspect that has kept us together, and such good friends throughout the years, and I hope to learn more about it if there is such an aspect of psychology. Now it is occuring to me that most of this entire writing is a run-on but I guess that is okay since it is more based on stream of consciousness, rather than stopping to take the time to realize and correct your errors. But anyways, as I was saying there are 3 business majors, then John is a Chemical Engineer also studying at UT, and he, along with me and Troy, who is 22, are all freshman, and Djordje is a sophomore. I sometimes wonder what its like to be a 22 year old Freshman, and to be starting your real life off that late, ever since Troy and I have met. He seems like a very interesting person to me, and I figure I will get to know him better as the year progresses, even though the four of us mostly stay in our rooms most of the time, rather than socialize together, but I guess its just nervousness of being alone, and without parents for the first time, and we will soon grow out of it. Speaking of parents, I hate to admit it, but I truly do miss my parents, and especially my dog, a dauschand, bevo, very much. Before I was to leave to move in to my apartment I couldn't wait to get out of there, and to get out on my own, figuring to be free of them for good, except for the occassional visits, and I would read the college things about how to expect home sickness, and I was thinking yeah right, not me, but just a few days after they had left, I already missed them, and I can't wait to see them again. Pretty sad on my part I guess on trying to be independent, but oh well, I just want to see my dog again, whom my life would be incomplete without, and the funny thing is for the first 15 or so years of my life I was afraid of dogs, and now I see the clock and I'm running of out of time, and it said my 20 minutes are up, so thats all I have to say. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     I feel like I am under a lot of stress right now at this time. All that I have been doing is wondering if I am going to make it through college alright. I am very hungry at this time. I do not know if I will get something to eat right after I am done with this assignment or if I will wait until I have done some other homework from another one of my classes. I know that I will have to get something very soon because I can smell the food that my friend is eating over there in the corner. I smells sooooo good that my stomach feels like it will never stop making the noises that it is making until I give some food to it. I feel sort of tired at this point in the day. I have just recently finished all of my classes which begin early in the morning and do not finish until late in the afternoon. That is sort of a good thing because I get a big break in the middle of the day, but I would rather get my school day over with early so that I could do homework at any time that I want to instead of being forced to do it right after class. The reason that I have a schedule that is this way is because I went to one of the last sessions of orientation and I did not get the times for the classes that I wanted. Right now my eyes are sort of getting tired because I am not used to typing for this many minutes straight without a single break. Usually when I type I will take a lot of breaks and I will waste a lot of time that I should not be wasting. Therefore, I guess that this is a beneficial assignment because it is teaching me something that I am not used to doing. There are many assingments that I am not used to doing that I have had to do for all of my classes. I get a lot of math homework, which is something that is completely different from high school. Back in high school I really did not have that difficult of a time with the work that I was given. I feel now that I will have to work very hard to attain grades similar to my high school ones. The reason that I figure this is because I have talked to many people that used to go to the University of Texas. Some say it is not that hard, but the majority of the people that I talk to say that I will have to work my tail off if I want to be at the top. They have said that everyone is just as smart as me at this school. I feel that this fact is a good thing. I like to be challeged against others who are at the same level as me or above. I feel that if I work hard that I can do anything that my mind imagines. I think that all people should have that kind of confidence because everyone in this world is worth something. Maaaannnn, I am really really really hungry because that food smells really good. I think that I am going to go and get something to eat after I finsh this assignment. I may have a burger or a few tacos or something. Whatever I get to eat, I know that it will be delicious because my stomach is turning and wishing for something to be put in it right now. I forgot to tell myself that my left foot hurts a whole lot. Yesterday I dropped a big can on the top of my foot and it swelled up a little bit and it still kind of hurts when I walk for a long time on it. I know that if I just gave it a little time to rest that it would probably be fine, but I have an active life and I really cannot do that. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     The green leaves outside are a very vibrant color of green today. I really hope it doesn't rain again today because I got really wet yesterday. That ticking closk is really annoying me. I never really notice it until I I have to go to work though. Theres my sisters Harry Potter book. I wonder if the next movie that comes out will be any good. I really hope it is. I have no idea why my Dad is so into trains right now, hes been collecting them everywhere. I think this is his midlife crisis hobby. We had to drive four hours this summer to go to a little dinky town called Rusk just to ride a steam train. It wasn't really worth it. I wanted the train to go under a tunnel or something but it never did. That French toast i made this morning really wasn't very good. I left a funny taste in my mouth. I should probably go brush my teeth, they have syrup all over them. I am so tired I shouldn't have stayed up as late as i did last night. Putting my thoughts on paper is really hard. I have no idea what to write.  My arm hurts. I think its because i haven't streched it since volleyball season last year. I hope the team does well this year. I'm pretty confident they will. They have some really good players this year. i wonder how good of a player Mr. Pace's daughter really is. she made varsiity this year as a freshmen but then again thats really not too hard to do, considering. The new coach seems to be aa good coach though. I really hope she's able to build up a strong team. I wish that I could play for one more year. volleyball is so much fun. I wonder if i could get a team together to play intramural volleyball. That would be a whole lot of fun. Dawn alread y said she didn't want to do it. She is so unmotivated sometimes. I think we need one of those wrist pads for our computer. My hand is getting tired. Its probably just because I haven't typed hardly anything for the entire summer. I really want to take a typing class somewhere so I would learn how to type a lot faster. That would make papers a lot easier to write.   "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm in my roomate's room right now, since my computer is not hooked up to the internet yet. I never realized how little she does. She has a piece of paper, apparently meant to be a homework assignment, but it's covered with the most random, 1st grade-type drawings I've ever seen. She obviously put a lot of effort into this. I guess she was trying to avoid doing her assignment. This room is a mess. I can't wait until my computer's working. I haven't checked my e-mail in a while. I guess I should do that, seeing as how I'm expecting scholarship information. I really need some more money, preferably free money. It'd be nice to not have to work for once in my life. Not like my parents help me. Thye have better things to spend it on, like my spoiled-rotten older sister who can't fend for herself because she's never had to. I wish I could call Mom evry month and tell her how much money I'll be needing this month to survive. It's pretty ridiculoous when you have to give plasma for food. I need to just file for independence, I basically support myself anyways. I'm actually thinking about getting my wisdom teeth pulled at one of those labs that tests anesthetics on you. I'm supposed to pay for it myself, but how the hell am I going to afford that?  Rent's coming up and I haven't even received all my financial aid money yet. Oh, well. Maybe I can somehow either win the lotto or get discovered. I'm going to a modeling contest in a week. Hopefully thing will go well there. I really need to get out of Texas. My boyfriend Brad lives 3 hours away in west Texas. He's supposed to start playing college football again in the Spring. There's going to be draft people there form the NFL. That'd be pretty cool too, except that if he moved to a different state, he'd want me to go with him. I'm not sure I want to succeed in getting out of here through him. Stephanie, my roommate, has some of my stuff in here. That kind of pisses me off. I don't take her shit. my other roommate Yoshi owes me $50 dollars. I need it for my psychology book (ironic, isn't it?). I found out yesterday that he owes all his friends money, almost $1000 total. I don't think I'm going to be seeing that money anytime soon. I don't get payed for another week, and my job pays crap. I want to get a new job, one that actually pays me decently, but unfortunately, I love my shitty job. I graduate in 1 1/2 years if things go right. That is, if I can get into the Psychology Dept. (once again, ironic). Why is Psychology the only major in Lberal Arts that I actually have to apply for?  I could've have gotten in easily when I first applied for school if I had known what I wanted to do. Oh, well, not much I can do about it now. I've missed way too many classes already, and it's only the 3rd week. I've never been sick in my life, and now my immune system decides to go on a vacation. I wonder if my parents realize that I'm probably never going to talk to them again after I graduate?  I know if I mean that or not. Sometomes I think I do. I don't think soomeone going to school full-time should ever be burdened as much as I am by financial responsibilities. It's jsut not right when, according to everything I've applied for, they make too much money. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     For all of my life, I have been in control; I have been so goal oreinted and focused, but now that I am finally in college, I have no idea what I am doing. I still work hard and am still focused, but I do not know what I am working towards. Eventually, I would just like to become a house wife. There is not really anything else I am interested in. Furthermore, my boyfriend of ten months and I broke up about two weeks before moving up here. At first I had the hardest time getting over him, but now I am ok. The wierd thing is, I do not miss him, but I miss what we had; I miss what the relationship brought to my life. Sometimes it really scares me because I think to myself,   What if no one else can offer me something so great as what he offered?    My roomate is my best friend, and at the moment both she and her boyfriend are here. I look at them and remember the feeling that I had two months ago and sometimes it makes me really down. I do not really understand myself because I am independent and I know how to be alone, yet at the same time I want that in my life. It's almost like a big fat contradiction. If I am so independent, then why do I want to have a guy in my life?  I don't think I'm explaining myself very well. Last night I just sat and thought for about two hours. There is so much uncertainty in what I am doing and where I am going. My peers have always looked up to me because I have always been the one that was going to make something of myself, but now I have no idea what I will be doing after graduation. I am doing this writing assignment and my roomate and her boyfriend are being loud. I don't think it would usually bother me, but I think the fact that I don't have a boyfriend anymore makes it bother me. I actually enjoy the single life, but at the same time, I miss having someone to share my thought and emotions with. I talk to my older brother a lot. He's 23 and lives in San Francisco. He's a really big factor in my life, always giving me advice and helping me through the rough times. I love the relationship that he and I share because we are more than just siblings, we are really good friends. Another thing that I think about is my family. My mom and I are really close. Sometimes she really upsets and annoys me, but nevertheless we get along really well. I thought I would cry when she dropped me off, but I barely even teared. When everyone went home for labor day weekend, I stayed here in Austin. I didn't want to go home. I didn't miss it yet. I always thought I would be homesick, and the fact that I am not, makes me feel sort of guilty. I miss my mom in the sense that she is my mom, but I don't feel the urge to see her, and that makes me feel guilty too. I am going home this weekend for a doctor's appointment. I think once I am home again I will be homesick. I like UT. It's wierd because college is supposed to be really stressful and I am sure that it will be, but for right now, I think college is really relaxing.  "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am so excited that I get to see my family this weekend. I never thought I would feel so home sick at college. I love my mother so much she has been through hell and back and still remains such a wonderful Christian mother. If I am half the mother she is to me when I have children I know I will be doing a great job. I am also really nervous about this presentation I have to do on Monday for my Media Studies class. Not only do I not know what to write about but I don't know how to prepare for it. Of course I got there late for my discussion group  so I got the bottom of the barrell when signing up for a presentation topic and the only one left was for Monday. But that is so my luck. It makes me think that if I am nervous about giving this in front of my discussion group of maybe twenty people how am I going to make it in the communications field which is what I am majoring in at this point. I really want to work for MTV. I know many people must think of this as a childish fantasy, but it is really something I am serious about and want to persue. I just love everything about music. The artists there story, the songs story, and how they make people fell. I can't wait till I am done typing this because then I get to go play Crainum with my roomate and a couple of our friends from back home. I am such a competitive person which to me is a good thing because it makes me have more determination then most people. I am watching Will and Grace and they are talking about having a baby. Gosh I can't wait till that day. I think I must have orange cones around me though and a flashing message that tells guys don't talk to her!  I swear they avoid me at all costs. What the heck is wrong with me. I think I might be a little intimidating because I don't play the role of a dumb girl who needs a guy to take care of her. Which I think I got that from my mother. She is a single mom, my father died when I was ten, who is a teacher and had to raise three children all by herself. She didn't need help from anyone and she never threw in the towel when times got hard. For that I respect and love her very much. God has blessed me with the best family I could have ever imaged. Not only my imidate family but everyone from my grandparents to aunts and uncles to cousins. All of them have played such an important part of my life and have thought me so much that I just want to go and hug all of them and say thanks for loving me it has given such strength. My grandparents are so great because they can always make me feel like a million bucks even when I am at my lowest. I think it is important to surround yourself with a close knit family. I don't know what I would do without mine. I am so glad I have my roomate and friends from back home here at UT. I probably won't have latest this long without them and there company. They all have such interesting stories that I had never know about them before. Most of my school went to Texas a and m which is exactly like my hometown. We all just needed something different and a place with a good sports team "
Tell me about yourself.,"     I know I said that I was ready to write but Im not too sure exactly what I need to be doing. I hope this is right. Great now Im worrying. I worry way too much that is a problem of mine. I always seem to worry even if there is no reason for it I even worry about other people's problems. I wish I could just be laid back sometimes like my best friend Joseph. He's also my roommate. Now Im now sure if this is right because Im telling you about myself when Im just supposed to be thinking. Okay now Im thinking. Why is my room so hot. Sometimes its not hot but right now Im boiling. I think it is because I am nervous about this assignment. Theres no reason to be I just need to type. Well here I am typing. My room smells funny right now. Joseph bought some cinna sticks from Dominoes a while back and I think that they are going bvad. I know they are going bad. I need to take out the trash than. I hate that I get lazy and don't take out the trash because it makes me feel and llok like a slob. Great now I propbably sound all anal about mess when Im not at all like that. Well im not a messy person but you know. Gosh reading over this I sound like such a pessimist and so boring. Oh well. Time sure is going by pretty slow. I want to make jell-o but I don't think I have room in fridge for it. Gosh some lime jell-o would be pretty good right now. I wonder how jell-o becomes jell-o . Like how does it form the way it does? Whats in gelatin to make it stiffen up and turn into jell-o. One day Im going to find out. More than likely I won't do it but it seems reassuring to tell myself that Im gooing to look into it. It makes me feel productive. Im worried about my financial situation right now. I still have almost 4000 to pay off and I got a loan for that and all but I don't know where that money is or who I need to talk to in order to get my hands on it. Tomorrow I guess Ill just need to go to the ssb and talk to someone about that. I can't think of anything else right now. I feel like Im just waisting time typing nothjing but if this ios what was wanted than who am I to say no. This should be an easy   a   or at least I hope. I hope the instructor doesnt read this and just because I said easy A then Im going to get like a   b   or something. Just in case Im sorry even if this seems easy I do my work and I dedicate time so when it comes down to it, I think I deserve that   a  . Great Im already negotiating for my grade and the instructor hasnt even seen this assignment. I wonder if this class will ever offer extra credit if ever im in need of some assistance? I doubt it especially if most of my high school teachers would just laugh if the subject was brought up. But then again a lot of those teachers had massive egos even though some of them had readon to have them. Ironically the teacher who had the most reason to have an ego was the most down to earth and lenient. Is lenient even a word? Oh well anyhow the teacher, her name was Ms. Ng, she scored perfect on her SAT's. How the heck did she ever pull that off. And since she did I have no idea why shes teaching at Edison. In case you dopnt know which you probably don't Edison is a public inner-city school in San Antonio and it does not have the best of reputations. I hate that though because any time your talking to someone important and you think your sounding intelligent and going somewhere with your conversation they would always seem to ask what school do you go to? And that great conversation just plummets to hell when you respond   Edison  . Esdpecially with teen-agers who think they are too good to even know of someone from Edison. Well thats their loss because Im a great person to know and I don't fit the   Edison   stereotype. There should be no stereotypes. They are just not fair. Hey cool ranting on and on made the time go by fast and its almost up. just 35 more seconds. 30 now. Wow this is actually good stress relief I should do this more often when I have time. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     Well, I am sitting here fighting with myself about whether or not I should go out tongight. It looks like i will probably give in and go to the KA house. I don't think I should because I have a lot of work to do. I am excited to go and see my grandmother tomorrow. I miss my friends a lot especially justin. I am wondering why I haven't been able to get a hold of him. so I don't have a lot on my mind, but this is fun because I get to listen to all of the music I just downloaded. our tv in the living room is super loud! I can hear it over my music and through a closed door. Things with bryan seem to be going well, but I definitely don't see things progressing too much further. I am really tired today. I should be sleeping a lot more than I have been. oh well. I need to do my devotional before I go anywhere tonight because I will feel really bad if i forget. I am very concerned about justin. I cannot stop thinking about what our issues are or aren't. I wonder what my parents are doing tonight. I miss seeing them every day, but at least I talk to them a lot. It feels super weird to be away and completely on my own, but I think I will surprise myself at how well I will do. That pizza that I ate earlier was not good. I guess it doesn't settle well because I don't eat it very often. I am so excited about my KIN class. It is so awesome, and I love that the professors are married and christians. That's so great. Paige is really cool, too, and I am very glad that she is in that class with me. I hope we end up hanging out a lot this year. I was so worried about meeting people who loved God, and it's been really reassuring so far. The tri-delts are perfect girls for me. They're so good, and they have 3 bible studies!  Yea!  Elton John is really talented. It cracks me up that I've gotten so into this computer business. It's really fun, though. I got my first email today. Who better from but Sebastian?  He's awesome, but it sucks that he lives in Chile. Okay, I am having a lull. I really feel very exhausted, but of course I will go out as soon as I finish this assignment. It is so stupid how vain I have gotten since I have been here, but I am sure that that will go away after a little time. I am so nervous about taking my first tests. I love all of my classes, but I wonder about how prepared I am from high school, and how well my study habits will allow me to do. This assignment is really very cool. I thought it would  take forever, but the time is flying. So I am very cold right now; surprise, surprise. I think of my girls from Kerrville every time that I begin a sentence with so. I definitely should not do that very much. My mother would not be proud of me.   Unchained Melody   must be one of the most romantic songs ever recorded. It makes me miss Justin. I suppose I will try to call him again right now. "
Tell me about yourself.,"The timer is already on 15 seconds and I was thinking what to write. I am waiting for my boyfriend Nathan to call me because we just talked and he beeped over and said he'd call back. The fan in my room is seriously getting on my nerves because I stripped something in it and it makes a funny vibrating noise. I guess I am nervous about writing this because my foot will not stop tapping. I am so tired. I do not want to go to my Nutrition class today. It's the same thing every day and it lasts for an hour and a half. I have so much homework to do also. I just found out that my e-mail in the UT Directory is wrong and I have no idea who to contact to change that either. My eyes are drooping so bad. I have so much to do today and just not enough time. I need to finish all my homework, go to class, go to the gym, take a shower before class, and after I go to the gym, and then read a book for my classical mythology class. I'm looking at the timer now and it is only on 3 minutes and 47 seconds. It feels like I've been writing for a lot longer already. I guess I should be lucky to even be on the Internet. My dorm, (Dobie), has had a lot of problems with Ethernet, and this morning (for the second time) when I awoke, my Internet would not work. It really sucked. My room is so dirty and I need to clean it. I hate making my bed and waking up to start another long day. My stomach hurts because I ate too much at lunch. The food wasn't really that great today either. I shouldn't have eaten any ice cream. I need to start eating a lot healthier than I have been. I feel bad that I have been cheating on my diet. It was a protein/no carbs diet and at first I did well, but lately I've been cheating. I need to go to Wal-Mart today to buy a friend of mine a wedding present. I can't beleive she's getting married. I'll probably be the last of my friends to get married. Three of the 5 of us are already married. My eyes are soooo tired. I just want to crawl back in bed. I really really wish today were Friday. I can't even imagine what next week will be like. after all, the past two weeks have been short weeks. Next week is our first full week. I am so ready for this weekend. I am going home and sleeping in my own bed finally. The phone is ringing. It is my boyfriend, Nathan. I'm explaining to him that I have to get off the phone because I am doing this assignment. Okay he is gone now. I told him to call me back in ten minutes and he said he'd call me back in a little while. that means by the time he calls I'll probably be in my 3:30 class. Sometimes he gets on my nerves so bad, but I love him so much. I just feel like he doesn't hardly ever have time for me. It's even harder now that I'm in school. We hardly have time to talk because he's at work from six a. m. to 5 p. m. and I don't get out of class m-f until 5 p. m. By that time both of us have to eat dinner, and I have homework or he has errands to run. sometimes he comes and sees me or I go see him. Seguin isn't really that far. But it is an annoying drive. This summer we're supposed to move in together. I almost wonder if we'll still be together then. It makes me sad to even think about us breaking up. He's the best thing that has ever happened to me and I've never been happier. I've also never been sadder sometimes. I guess that's just part of being in an adult relationship. If we live together this summer, we're going to live in San Marcos. I wish we could live in Austin, but he would have to drive to San Antonio every day. Oh well. I still have six minutes left to type. I need to call my mom today and see how my family is doing. They came up to see me on Sunday, but didn't get to stay long. It really is amazing how our relationship has changed. They finally respect me and give me my own space. Before, me and my parents argued ALL the time. Now we actually have phone conversations without even saying one cross word. it's pretty nice. I know it's just because they miss me though. The lights in my room are so annoying. the ones that came affixed to the walls are bright harsh florescent lights. the other ones we bought are sooo bright they hurt my eyes. I guess I'm not going to get to work out today. It's already 12:45 and I still have a lot to do before my three thirty class. I wonder what you guys are going to learn from all this babbling of mine?  To me, I wouldn't see anything interesting about a bunch of kids rambling on about their thoughts. Damn my typing needs work. I used to be a great typist, now I have to backspace a million times to get it right. It's terribly annoying. I think after I'm done with this I might sign up for my experiments for this class. I did the pretest the other day. it took way longer than I expected. My arms and hands are getting tired of typing. I can't wait until this is over. only 48 more seconds. that fan is still making that stupid noise, and my suitemate just got home. She always slams the door. I really need to clean my room and I guess I will in about 5 seconds. Okay well bye for now. I'm not going to finish my writing now that my 20 min. are up. I've got lots of other things to do today. bye "
Tell me about yourself.,"i wonder if kyle will call. he lies all the time kyle listening to music reminds me about kyle, about our relationship about how good it was, he used to be so sweet, kissing me and i know that he really did love me at one time, why has everything changed, why does he still tell me he loves me but acts mean to me, i hate that he tells me i shoudldnt go out and party and have fun because he does it too, he gets involved with others while i just window shop at guys, im just not attracted to some of the gusy here, they are morons, they have money stuck on their minds along with sex. i don't feel pretty enough for some of the nice guys that i do meet, i have gained sooo much weight in the last two years, fat. i feel so fat, i can't wear anything anymore because it looks so terrible, i used to feel pretty and normal back home where i everyone seemed to love me, I've been so homesick, i miss my granny and janie and kyles family. i worry about tara back home, if shes making the right decisions if she really will go to college, i at least want her to go to kc i don't want her to end up like everyone else in kilgore, they end up working at some department store making minimum wage and haveing five babies and getting on food stamps. shes better than that. i love her and want her to not end up my mom. i hate my mother. she has to be the worst person ever to just leave me behind, to leave me like i don't matter, to not come to my graduation, to not try to see me to leave me for a man that she doesnt love. she was so wrong to my dad. i wish she would go to prison and i hate her so much. i can't be like her i can't end up like her. i will never hurt my children when im a mom. i will be a good mother. a mom who plays tea party and who devotes her life to them. they will be my world. i wonder if ill marry kyle, i wonder if he will be the father of my children. i hate not knowing how he feels. he pisses me off. he says he loves me and at time i really think he does but then  he treats me like shit too. i wish i could say no to him but it always seems so impossible. i love him. everything reminds me of him. every conversation i have involves his name everything i hear or see reminds me of the good times we had. we were in love. a guy just doesnt do the stupid things he does. but then why did he have to reverse all that. why did he date that trish when he left to go to college, we were together and he dated her and i really don't trust him. hes nothing but a big mystery to me. what is it about him, what is missing that i don't know about. i feel like hes hiding something really really bad from me. he used to scare me when he said hes involved in the mafia. i believe him some of the time. its weird how everything he says is right. hes so weird. kyle is reallly really weird. i want to go see him. i want him to take me to a football game. i wonder why he liked me. i was five years younger than him. a baby compared to him. he never had a girlfriend until me. not a serious one anyway, just girls that he played and used. what made him fall in love with me. what makes him have control over me. i let him. everythihng he does is my fault becuase i let him do it. i let hime make me feel bad but i don't know how to get away from that. i feel like hes the only person in this world that knows everything about me. everything and hes the only one that understands everything i do and have been through. i miss him. i hate him too. i really want to cry this music im listening to is so damn depressing. bryan adams. romantic music. this reminds me of back home. i miss kilgore, i hated it when i left and now i miss it. its small but a good town. im ready to go to homecoming. i wonder if ill have any attention. i used to remember the college kids coming hnome for the first time and how cool it was. i wonder if people will be happy to see me. i wonder if they will think i look different. freshman fifteen surely not in a month. its alcohol. i think i drink too much. i miss riding by myslef with a case on the backroads back in kilgore. those were the days. "
Tell me about yourself.," I sure am glad to get this out of the way. I really enjoy all of my new classes but by math Professor is really hard to understand. I miss Jenny so much and ca not wait until this weekend when I get to see her. This typing stuff and I don't get along very well but thats why I have voice activated word processor. I talk and it types everything that I pronounce. I really don't think that fifteen hours on the first semester of school was a very good idea. I have absolutely no free time. I have PHL, PSY and RHE so I am reading all the time. At least I have a few good friends in most of my classes. I need to get my head back in school though because right now it is still in summer. All the information I receive in lectures simply goes in one ear and out the other. I hope my Mom is doing better. I left her alone all by herself when I moved to college. Wow, this is a really elementary level paragraph,   Ehh, O well.   So I wonder if its true that guys can blank out and be thinking about nothing, no literally nothing and girls always have thoughts flying through their heads. If its true the girls papers should be some what longer than the guys unless of course the girl cannot type very well (like me). I really wish I could decide on a major soon but if not I know everything will be just fine. The only thing I would like to have more of is free time. I have no free time to get my mind off of the books. Hopefully that will come soon. Im getting pretty tired of riding the capital metro to and from school I really need to see about a dorm room for next semester but for sure next year. I feel like I am writing diary or something, actually it's quite relaxing and stress relieving. I need to see about going to my chem. and math's professors office hours. Well Im thinking so hard on what to write about that I am drawing a blank, I think its the small amount of sleep I have been acquiring. I wonder if my cars AC will be fixed tomorrow like they said but then again they said it would be today and I'm still with out a car. It's very hard not to use   IM   language on this and abbreviate everything. By the way I suck at spelling so sorry if anyone reads this other than me. I wonder what all the goop is inside my lava lamp is made of?  I don't know but I do know that my Chem. professor wouldn't know because he have a hard enough time trying to teach my class of 500 the chemistry basics. Sweet it's already over, man that was fast, too bad it's not like that in class. "
Tell me about yourself.," Hi, my name is Ashlee Vicars and I am a new student at the University of Texas in Austin. I absolutely love it here! It is so much more than I expected. I am living with a friend from back home that is a sophomore here. I didn't know anyone here when I came so I decided to go through the rush process and go greek. I was very disappointd in the greek system. They are so political here in Austin. I felt like I was cheated out of a few good sororities because my parents didn't go greek in college or did not have as much money as other girls going through rush. A lot of the legacy stuff didn't make sense to me. Oh well, I ended up pledging Alpha ChiOmega and I absolutely love it !  The sweetest girls in the owrld are in there and they are so much fun!  I have made many friendships that will last for a lifetime already. Right now my roomate and her boyfriend went to eat and I am typing this for my new psych class. I am listening to a song from back home that makes me miss my x boyfriend. We were together for the past year and I was so in love with him, but he was 21 and I was 18 and that 's not a bad age difference, but he just wanted to party all of the time, which is okay, but he drank every night we were together and that really upset me. That also led into him lying to me and doing things behind my back that really hurt so I broke up with him. But I still miss him so much. But moving to Austin is a good thing for me because I am away from everyithing from back home and I can start all over. He wasn't good for me at the time. Hompefully he will grow out of his drinking stage and maybe someday we will wokr everything out, but until then I am not putting up with that and i can do better. I love the new girls in my sorority, they are so sweet!  It made me think of that because  a new friend of mine Jill, knew Jacob, my x-boyfriend, and they were friends their senior year. Its knda crazy becasue I am from Pottsboro, an hour north of dallas, she is from Plano, and he is from Prosper. I met Jacob at the lake when I was modeling for a swimsuit store. We fell in love and spent the next year together. ANyways, i have been knda upset with my parents lately because they are just really frustrating me. Everytime I talk to them they arelik how are yoyr grades?  When it has only been 2 weeks and this is like the first assisnment I have turned in. They are so worried that I am just down here partying and not going to class. I don't know why they think that because coming to UT has been a dream of mine since I was a little girl!  I am so happy here!  My mom got upset with me last night  becasue i told her I was going to the Tulane vs. Texas game in New Orleans and she said no, and I said well I'm old enought to make my own decisions now. Why would she not want me to go on a roadtrip with all my new sorority sisters and have fun?  And then I was going to eat dinner at 10:00 at night and she flipped out on me because I had class the next day. She is being unreal. And I havne't talked to my dad in over a week because we just argue about how i should be using my time wisely at college. I don't even want to go home and visit anymore. I have always had a good relationship with both of myparents so I don't know why now it is a problem. I love them to death but I just can't talk to them for a couple of days. My roommate is cool, but she sometimes gets on my nerves. She never cleans up after hersolf and she always has one of her two boyfriend over here (that don't know about one another) and she is sleeping with both of them and then asks me to cover for her. but at the same time she is doing their laundry here and being inconsiderate of me. I don;'t know, i'm just really stressed out right now. MY new friends here ar eawesome though. I guess I keep talking about them because this is the first time in 7 years that I havene't had a serious boyfriend. But I like the single life sometimes, I don't have to answer to anybody or call in and check in with anyone anymore. My friends just fight with their boyriends all of the time. I came from a small town where you were able to be involved in everything. I played basketball, ran track, softball, was a cheerleader all thourhg school, did student council, sisters of service, fellowship of christian athletes, and took a few leadership roles and it was great. But a lot of girls hated me for it. I was alway ssweet to everyone but the girls always taked bad about me because I was friends with their boyfriends or was with the guy they wantred. Now that I am in Ausitn, i don't have to worry about jelaous girls anymore. Which is so awesome. I used to come home from school and cheerleading practice crying because of some of the things the girls would say to me. THey were so hateful and mean. I loved to cheerlead, but half way through my senior year iI quit cheerleadeing because the girls got so bad. It was really messed up. I always argued with our sponsor because she didn't like me and I had no respect for her because she cheated on her husband and slept with the football coach and she was just horrible. And then she tried to date my boyfriend. This was our sponsor, what kind of authority position was she to be in?  Anyways, this is just what all is on my mind . I will make my parents happy and come home with awesome grades this semester abd they will be so proud of me!  That is my main goal in life right now!       "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am thinking about a lot of things right now. I just got off of work a little while ago and just ate dinner. It was really good. I really like my nails that I just got done today and I notice they look really nice as I am typing. I hope I can do okay in college. This first week seemed pretty hard and it kind of scared me. I hope it gets easier. I am thinking about how I am going to arrange my experiments and where they are located. I had a really boring time at work today. I work with a guy that goes to Southest Texas State University and he is about to graduate. We have been talking about college alot lately and he has helped me. I have a boyfriend named Trent. I have been with him for 2 years. I am off of work tomorrow which is good that I get a brak. I just got paid this weekend and I like getting paid. I am stuck and I don't know what to write about. Thins is a really good assignment though. I like doing stuff like this. 20 minutes is a long time though and I hope my computer doesn't kick me off the internet becasue it sometimes does that. I am so full right now. I had a coney from Sonic and I don't think I am going to eat for a whole week. I am so fat. Ever since mid way through high school, I have been fat. Being with Trent has made me even more fat because we eat out a lot. He has gained a lot of weight also. I love him so much and I think about him all the time. I can't wait to get through college, marry hima dn start our family. We have a lot in common and we even want the same kind of kids, you know the genders in a certain order. Well I am running low on thoughts. I can't seem to think of anything clearly when I need to most, like right now. I have done these things before, like I have said, but they have only been for 5 minutes at the most. I really like the idea of going to UT but it is going to be a major challenge. I see that it will take a lot of dedication to myself. I am planning on majoring in nursing. I really didn't know what I wanted to do and nursing seemed like it was good enough and I could still go to UT. I looked at all the positive things it had and right now in this day and age, nursing is very beneficial and can be done almost anywhere, not that I want to leave Texas. I can't wait until my dad starts treating me like I am an adul since I am legally now. I wish he would let go. He says he is trying to work on it but he needs to do it faster. He needs to treat me like the 18 year old college girl that I am. He won't let me be as independent as I want to be. I don't know what else I can do to prove to him that I am raised and I can take it from here, just not quite financially. My fingers are starting to get cramped. I am getting really tired and the time is going to be up soon. I am going to look around a little bit more at my class web pages then I am going to lay down and go to sleepI miss dancing. I may not have been the best at it but I miss it from high school. Maybe eventually I will get into something at UT if I am good enough. Of course I need to loose a little bit of weight. I would like oto take one of the excersize classes since I can't afford to join a gym. I am discovering that I don't like my car as much as I did and I think I want something a little more sportier and maybe faster.        "
Tell me about yourself.,"     I don't know what to write about right now. I guess i'll start by telling you how I feel right now. I've been a little depressed lately. Complicated stuff with my girlfriend. Well she's not really my girlfriend becuase she said we are only   dating   so it isn't as serious as going out. She's in K D Phi so she's been really busy with sorority stuff. I guess I just miss spending time with her. I also thought about joining Lamda because I couldn't hang out with her. Now I realize that would be a bad move becuase I need to concentrate on my classes. I am going to make an   A   in all of my classes. I need this 4. 0 to have a better chance getting into the Business school. My sister believes I can do this and I think that if I try really hard I will do it. Wow it's only been three mins and 50 seconds. This is harder than I thought. Hmm I don't know what else to say and I feel obligated to keep typing the entire twenty minutes. I just popped my knuckles and I know i should stop doing that because it's really bad for me. I'll prob end up having arthritis when I get old. I'll talk about my environment now. I'm in my friends room at Jester West. Room 151. There are four of them in this room. Caleb just said he hates working on Fridays. I would too, if i had a job =P. Enoch is sitting beside me and doing stuff on his computer. He said he needs to work on some website this weekend. Caleb is eating barbeque he got from Jester City Limits. He said the sauce is kind of spicy. They are watching Fox News right now. Now back to MTV and Shikra is on. Damn she's hot =). Marco is on his computer messing with some photoshop stuff. I don't know how to use photoshop. I just play games on my computer. Oh yeah, and sometimes do homework on it =P. wowowow, its only been 8 minutes and 20 seconds. dang time is going by slowly. haha, now they are watching tennis. ok, nevermind they are just flipping through the channels. It smells really bad now, someone farted =X. Marco said it wasn't him but i think it was. Enoch is getting me to write more. Now he's telling his brother that he was put on the second network. For some reason last night his uploads went crazy, which put him over the bandwidth limit. The second network doesn't seem that bad. All the webpages he went to opened quickly and stuff. Marco needs a new computer. He's singing it to some song on mtv right now.   I need a new computer. mine's a piece of trash. whoaahh   haha weirdo right? =P  uhh ohh now everyone is humming/singing to the song!  oOoOo a girl is coming here right now, because it says on her away message that she is stopping by. dang it now its been 12 minutes 30 seconds. lalalalalala I miss Patti =P this sucks. I was pretty sad last night because i started thinking about her again. Well atleast she goes to the same school. My friend Alex goes here, and his girlfriend Jenny goes to . that girl is here now. oh yea jenny goes to UT arlington. Needa smells like girly stuff, she smells good. She said girls fart and go number 2 just like guys. Jenny is going to try to transfer to Austin next year. She's been more depressed than i have because she hates it there. She found jizz on her couch at her apartment and she was like what the hezzy. =\ oh yeah i left my phone in someone's car and haven't gott   its evolution baby!   - marco - weirdo. i haven't gotten my phone back yet. I went ALL day yesterday without my phone. I was a new experience. A bad one. jenny's instant messaging me right now. hmm 16 minutes and 40 seconds. almost done!  haha i guess thats what i'm suppose to be talking about right? what's going through my mind. caleb doesn't know what this is he asked me ahaha here ill start writing lyrics for   marco is stupid    haha he's watching so i had to write that. nevermind the song goes to fast, i cant' type the lyrics. woot! almost done less than 2 minutes left. i played volleyball last night for the first time in a couple years. there were some guys there that were really good, and i had this short girl on my team named isabel  and they spiked it at her really hard and she was like   ahhh   and got out of the way of the ball, it was funny. 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 29 30 haha i'm almost done woohoo. first writing assignment finished in 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 woot! "
Tell me about yourself.,"     Now I am really annoyed. I already typed a stream of consciousness for 20 minutes. But when I clicked on Finish, it had an error. I have to do this entire thing AGAIN. ARG. It is almost 1 am and I'm really tired. But I can not go to sleep or feel accomplished until I finish this. This is exactly why computers are annoying. They have problems, and if you did not save your work. Everything you did before is totally lost. I just finished filling out the forms for crew. My hand is already a little sore from signing so many forms and such. I think Emily just got offline. Vivek just Im'ed me. He rarely im's me anymore. We used to be best freinds, but now things are just weird between us. He once confessed that he loved me, but I didn't feel the same way. So I reacted badly and got mad at him. I felt that he was ruining our friendship, which is exactly what ended up happening. So now he and I both have our own boyfriend and girlfriend, but it's just not the same. Otto just imed me too. I want to talk to him. And he should have been able to call 15 minutes ago since I was SUPPOSED to be done with this assignment already. But NO. the stupid internet and connection had to go crazy on me. I do kind of wonder if the TA's now have to read TWO of my writings. Oh well. I'm too lazy. I'm so tired. I walked and started training for rowing. At least I'm not as scared anymore since the girls did not look any different from me. So we are all in the same boat. I just have this fear of being too buff. But I do need to work out and get more fit. If i don't make the rowing team, I think i will try to join the newspaper. I used to be on yearbooks, I still have to submit my application for officer for CTSA. Too much to do. People say how college students shouldn't overwhelm themselves teh frist year. But i personally think that the first is the best and more important year. So I should be going out, trying out everything that i possibly can. And then later i can decide which select few clubs/orgaizations/activites are important to me. I did almost everything my freshman year in high school, but by my senior year it was reduced to just debate, orchestra, NHS, and STAND. Hopefully I can do the same thing for college. But, with more pretigous titles so I can get a good job. I think life is redundant. All we do it work, eat, and sleep. Honestly, what is the purpose of life? We live it to teh fullest extent, but still what is the point. I can join thousands of clubs and do thousands of activies and be the richest person alive and most powerful. But in the end, we all die. Nothing is any different. Humans are humans, and we just seem to have no real purpose. I guess thats too deep of a question to be thinking of this late. But I always think the most right before I go to sleep. My mind always goes on overdrive. And i suddenly think/contemplate things that I would not have during the day. Yes, EMily is offline. She didn't even bother to IM me. It bothers me that she just uses me and I let her. Maybe I should just ignore her, but who knows. I've known her too long to give up our werid love-hate friendship that we have. I'm afraid that this writing assignment is going to be judged and graded also from our grammer and spelling, and punctuation. Mine is really bad. I have so many typos and such because when I bother to backspace and correct my mistakes, I lose my train of thought. I always seem to think faster than I can type. I think it's the same for everyone else too. I love this song by The sky is blue, baby i love you. . Martina McBride's song is so pretty. I love happy songs. emotioanlly attracted, physically active. the lyrics are going to be stuck in my head later, I just know it. Baby I love you. sigh, I still have 5 more minutes. My brain is getting tired of thinking or trying to slow down my thoughts to the point where I can type them all down. My roommate isn't in the room right now. She's never here at night, but she takes so many naps during the day. It's very odd. Her schedule is screwed up. But at least I don't have to worry about bothering her from all my loud typing. I'm sure it must sound really annoying. She doesn't even have a computer. I don't understand how she can stand that. I live and breathe for my computer, even though I am totally computer illiterate. I had to have my boyfriend and guy friends show me how to download music. My younger sister is even better with computers than me. Hopefully my MIS310 class will teach me more about computers so I do nt always feel so incompetant. And then I will also learn how to make my own web-page. I think that sounds like a lot of fun. This seems to be a lot to read. I wonder if the TA's actually read everyone's   essay.  Or maybe they just give us a check for completion. I dont' remember what the instructor said in class. Sometimes I get my classes mixed up. Thats why I have to color code everything, and orgainze my stuff. I am such a neat freak. My roommate is really messy and it bothers me. But not as much as I would have thought it would. She keeps it on her side, so it's not too bad. But I also have to LOOK at her side of the room. I try to sit and face my side of the room since its so much prettier. HEHE, i think that sounded really conceited. Not to  "
Tell me about yourself.,"     Okay, I thought right now would be the best time to do this. I'm alone and can think aobut what's going on. These last couple of weeks and been great as in school wise but my personal life has been shitty. We got into a wreck where alcohol was involved and the thing was the driver was designated and had nothing to drink and it was the other guys fault. Somehow with our parents we though we could cover it up aobut the alcohol but they found out aobut everything. This is all that keeps playing over and over right now. Where did we mess up? Well the past is the past and you can't change it. My dad came down and was very disappointed. He didn't know I had been drinknig for 1 and half years now and I don't evne get drunk. I get a buzz and I'm good. I have a few drinks every now and then not even all the time. For some reason he doesn't beleive it. He was furious. He's always trusted me for everything and never thought I'd mess up like this. I do good in school graduated top 2% of my class and everything. I have always done good in school and put school first jsut like my parents taught me too. I never wanted to disappoint my parents. I kept it so none of my little mess-ups would ever reach them. So they would think of me as they saw me everyday. This last senior year I started going to parties and hanging out with different people. I'm a real easy going person. The way I think is that I don't care aobut anything. I let things happen. I make the decisions that I think are right at the time and let whatever happen. I like to make people happy. I'm one of those people that when someone is arguing aobut something I let them argue and win. If they think they are right than they feel good. As for me I don't care. I know I'm right or wrong and I let it be, as lngo as their happy it's all good. So aobut the drinknig I have no idea what lead me to it. I used to be a very shy and not really outgonig person. Everyone liked me but I never tlaked oir anything but people knew me just because I was the only Indian at my school and I was easy gonig and friendly. I hate no one, I think everyone has a good side as long as they don't screw me over. Once someone screws me over than I don't like them but until then I try to get along with everyone. Well I guess that's why I staretd drinkngi to get my shyness away. Very bad excuse, I know. My dad thinks it's peer pressure. Peer pressure has never gotten to me I odn't think. I have a strong will about serious things. If I think it's bad and will do something to me I don't like than I won't do it. I tried weed too because I wanted to know the feeling and after researching that it won't cause damage liek other drugs. I tried smokngi cigars and cigarettes jsut to try it and I have astma so I decdie that wasn't for me. I never did really like the idea aobut smokngi. So so I decdied to stick to drinking because after a couple of times I liked the feeling. It was something different to get awya kind of form reality and really let yourslef go but at the same time still know what your doing. My mind goes from one thing to another right now jsut cause of my dad. My mom doesn't know anything which she would probably cry if she found out and that would make me the guiltiest person ever. I would hate that. My dad I don't know. As I sit here thikngi aobut him I feel more and mroe sorry. He came yesterday and gave me a lecture and I said I wouldn't dirnk anymroe but in a way that didn't sound half-true because I couldn't be sincere I thought it was bullshit. A few drinks every now and then can't hurt. Well I know it can but still it's weird I don't know how to explain. Well he came today again and tried to have anothe rone on one. Me and my dad rarely talk I talk to my mom aobut my problems, so I got angry this afternoon and totally went off when he asked me if I was still going to dirnk and if I had done any other drugs. He doesn't trust me me anymore. That hurts the worst. I'm not a eprson to show my feelings ever because I l;iek to think things thorugh. Right now I feel very guilty. I totally blew my dad off this afternoon and I saw the hurt in his eyes and my dad is rarely a person to show his feelings. I guess I get it from him. It's weird. So now I'mthinkngi aobut how I can make it up. I got a e-mail from one of my ex-best friend that's a gurl. We tried gonig out but it didn't work and then firendship fell thorugh too. But somehow we're still really close even thoguh we don't talk to each other anymore. My dad was discussing me with his best friends who is the girl's father. She said I sohuld stop drinknig and that my dad was really hurt. For some reason I still lsiten ot her so I'm reallyt thikngi abut callnig my dad and saying sorry and sincerely saying that I'm going to stop drinknig. I really do want to stop now. I know I can stop if I put my mind to it. I don't need alcohol anymore. One night can ruin the next 6 years haha. It's crazy "
Tell me about yourself.,"   Yes, I'm finally in college. It feels wierd because ever sinse elementary school the teachers were trying to prepare you for college, my parents were trying to prepare me for college and I'm finally here. It feels good to go home every now and then because I feel important. Just hearing the girls in the hallway joking around and laughing outside of my dorm right now makes me love the sweet old college life even more. The smell from my basketball shoes brings back great times I've had in high school on the basketball team and makes me want to try out for the basketball team here at U. T. Noticing all of my clothes thrown around in my dorm give me the great feeling of independence from my mother. There is no one here telling me what to do like clean my room. I'm feeling really good about my classes and I'm trying to get over my habit of procrastination. I can't wait until the weekend comes because the music I'm listening to makes me want to go to the club and check out the girls and dance. I'm glad I'm in college because I here that it is going to be the best years of my life and so far it has been pretty fun.     "
Tell me about yourself.,"     The room seems to be nice and cool, much better than the heat outside. I should keep in mind that in thirty minutes or so I will go to a study group. I'm kind of hungry, i don't know what I should get for dinner today. Should I go for sushi or pasta, why am I so indecisive?  I wonder what my friends are doing right now. I hate it when I don't know what to write, or when I have a blank moment. I should remember to check if there are any conflicting exam times with my biology class exam. What is it that makes people tick?  As soon as I find the time to, I'm going to read Lord of The Rings. Maybe i shouldn't get sushi because its too expensive, but its also so good. There goes my indecisiveness again. I wonder which song I should listen to next, what am I in the mood for. This song sounds good, I guess I'll stick with this one for a while until I get bored of it. Is there any other homework left, I hate it whenever I get the feeling that I'm forgetting something but can't seem to find out what. It might be a good idea to do laundry this weekend, but i'll probably get lazy again, must remind myself not to be lazy. Maybe I should call my study partner that I might be late in coming because of thi essay. I'll turn around for a while and see what my roommate is watching on TV. I wonder if the music that I'm playing bugs my roommate or not. The TV show thats on right now seems pretty funny. I've never had Mountain Dew: Code Red before, maybe I should try it sometime, that is as soon as they restock the coke machines in my dorm. What is the point of life? All we do is try to become someone who has a purpose in society, and then in the end it doesn't even matter cause we all eventually die. I wonder what it would be like if I could be immortal. Many seems to think that being immortal is a curse cause you'll go through a lot of pain and it'll never end, I on the other hand find it interesting. I hope I can get a high GPA and keep it, it would really be nice if something academic turned out perfectly the way I wanted it to. I still kind of mad at the chemistry online homework, how could I be so stupid as to make such stupid mistakes. Oh well I can make it up on the next homework. I better do good on the exam, cause this is supposed to be easy for me since I've done it all already.   "
Tell me about yourself.,"    I am sitting in my dorm room right now, trying to think of something to write about. Although the instructions recommend that we don't do any thinking first, I'm still going to think as I write this intro. You see, it's my birthday today, and so I could write about that, but really that's kind of boring. I'm taking a girl I like to a party tonight - I guess that might be more interesting. Or maybe I should just talk about how my parents really piss me off.          Since about the third month of my senior year, we've actually gotten along much better. But before that, damn, it was a war zone in our house. They would bitch about anything, seriously. I mean, I had great testing scores, brought home good grades, didn't get in much trouble, and they still treated me like dirt. My friend Jackson once told me I should get in a lot of trouble. Then, although it would suck for a while because they were mad at me, in the future they would appreciate my good behavior. For some reason I never got the courage up to do this and continued to try and hide any activities that they would approve of. But, he was right. When they received a call from the police during my junior year, it paved the way for me to ameliorate our relationship throughout my senior year.        Okay, new topic. When I was over at my friend Alex's house one day, this kid pulls out Alex's . 22 rifle. I'm like,   Dude, don't point that at me, turn it away.   He listens, and he starts pointing it at Alex. Alex is pretty quiet most of the time, so he didn't say much. This kid is pointing the rifle at Alex, making shooting noises, while Alex is playing a Nintendo game. For some reason, I had a really bad feeling. This was not a toy - it was a gun. POP!  All of a sudden it went off. The thing was, the kid was at such close range, Alex couldn't even feel the blast. I had to tell him he was spurting blood out the side of his head. I ran to call the ambulance, and I think this other dude went to look for bandages and stuff. Anyway, because of that and one other incident that was even more frightening (but too complex to describe here), I've never liked guns.          My phone's ringing right now, but I'm not going to pick it up since I'm doing this assignment. You know, I bet it's someone calling to wish me a happy birthday. That's so boring. I like the idea of randomly exchanging gifts with people you care about because it means more if you're not expecting it. Looking at the timer, it's about time to wrap things up. I'm not going to take the time to edit this, since it was a stream of consciousness. But thanks for listening and I'll catch you on the flip side.        "

Tell me about yourself.,"Somtimes I don't understand why people are the way they are. Why am I falling in love with a guy that I can't be with? I mean, my gah, we're perfect for each other other than the fact that he thinks I'm some sort of deluded tricked person who is believing wrong (referring to my religion). We're both stubborn in the aspect of our beliefs and aren't willing to compromise however there is this unnaturally strong bond, I guess you could say, between us. I don't know what to do. I want to be with him so bad, I really honestly and truly do however I'm afraid of getitng hurt again. Maybe I am delusional, maybe its because I'm afraid I can't get a guy here. Maybe I don't know what I believe or not. I question what I really want and often wonder why I choose to live the way I do. Why do I sacrifice happiness for the sake of morality? Something that would make me happy, why do I avoid it? Because I'm afraid that God will condemn me to hell. Yes, that must be it. I know I'm saved and that I will go to heaven however I feel that other people will condemn me, I will condemn myself and ultimately God will condemn me. Fear of man, fear of myself, fear of God, fear of doing what I want, fear of getting pregnant if I choose to have sex, all of these things cause me inner turmoil. Why be with a guy that's all the way up in New York and you're down in Texas? I love him, I want to be with him, but I'm denying my inner feelings somehow--I don't know 100% what I feel or how I feel it. . I don't know if I'm creating some sort of mental captivity for myself by not choosing to be with him--am I missing out on the best thing of my life?  He says all the right things, but does he truly mean what he says?  I guess only showing will prove it.   I do like this rose that he gave me. I mounted it on this background thing of New York City that I made. its a beautiful glass rose, but it broke in the mail. He was upset that it wasn't perfect however me and symbolism, I said it was better that it was broken because things aren't perfect, and even though it will be mended, it won't be perfect. And that's okay. Nothing is perfect. The rose is so beautiful. It offsets the background and the Statue of Liberty infront of it. I love New York. Do I love this guy because I love New York so much? Or do I love New York so much because I love this guy? Who knows? All I know is that its raining here, and I'm sitting alone in my dorm room, cold and alone. surrounded by the mass but alone in spirit. alone in body. alone. I think its stopped raining now, but I'm not sure if it will continue. I have no umbrella. I'm not prepared for the storm. Like life, huh? You can prepare yourself for everything except the most obvious--what happens if it rains? You prepare for the cold, you prepare for the wind, you prepare for the ice. . but the rain comes, and you have nothing. No umbrella, nothing. all you have is what you took with you. . your books, your clothes, your hand, the trees or a overhang of a building.   I came here to Austin not knowing anything. I mean I knew what I've heard but I didn't actually know. I now know, and I don't know what to think. The mass is around me but I'm alone. . alone, cold standing in the rain with no umbrella. dreaming about the distance, and longing for the closeness.   I've thought about becoming a psychologist. . However I don't know if I want to abandon business. I don't know what I want to do really. I mean, I know certain things I like however I don't know what I want to do with what I like. I like many things but I love little. I've always helped people with their problems, listened to their issues, offered my advice when prompted. maybe its time I get paid for it, lol. . I wrote in my notebook about becoming a psychology professor--that way I can interact with students, be in authority and teach about psychology. but I don't know if I want to do that. . Why wouldn't I want to? Money, travelling, I don't know to be honest.   Wow, ten minutes and I've typed a novel. . Omg, I feel for the individual who has to read this, lol. I guess its a curse from typing since like the 4th grade. I think I can get up to like 100 words a minute now. . I was talking to this one guy online however I told him I would   brb in 20  . He has a crush on me. I don't like him. I know its for superficial reasons, but I don't wish to get in an internet relationship, lol. Yeah it would end up being an internet relationship. and I'm not about to go down that road, lol. . The first and ONLY one was this one guy who ended up being a clingy-blood-craving-dog-collar-wearing-submissive ex-goth who liked to bite people. Strange, eh? Weird guys fall for me, lol. One guy. . omg, the state hospital patient--He hit on me while I was volunteering there for bingo, omg. that was scary, haha. Then there was the drunk guy who said I was Miss America 2002--poor kid, lol. . Then, let's see. . the ex goth, the state hospital guy, the drunk dude. Hmm, I know there's more. . Ahh yes, boyfriend number one. The sex-craving chain smoker who was like 5 inches shorter than me. I learned from this guy to ALWAYS tell your mother about your relationships. That stupid dork called my house at midnight and was saying nasty things to my mother thinking it was me, lol. I came home and my door was off the hinges, my tv, stereo and phone were out and she changed the dead bolts on my door. THEN we proceeded to go to the health  clinic where I got the hepatitus A series vaccine (which is good to have anyways lol) and was threatened to get tested for AIDs. It was a traumatic experience, lol. Darn those junior high days lol. .   Well I have less than five minutes left and have managed to go thru most all of my relationships. LoL, wow, the more I remember them, the funnier they get. . my friends think they're hilarious lol. But one thing I've learned--I can't please everyone. I guess I have to live for myself and that's about it. Though I have religion and the morals that   confine   me with that--it should be done out of love. . but right now I don't have love. I want love to give to God, but I'm so caught up in what I want and the inner turmoil that its causing me to just want happiness with this guy, I managed to squeeze out love or desire to grow with God more. . Yes, it hurts to say it, and to acknowledge it. . but hey, I guess its the truth? I guess that's why this was the first assignment--so we can see what we really think and feel. . to write them out and to put them on the table so we can look at what we feel and not deny that we truly did think what we thought. Hmm. two and a half minutes left. .   I think I want to skip class. . lol, I'll go though. . I just hope I don't get rained on. A perfect ending to a perfect essay. . with one exception. Perfection doesn't exist. Morality doesn't want to exist. And I don't know where to find an umbrella.   In the last few seconds or minutes or whatever, my mind wonders to the pasta I had for lunch. NO clue as to why, lol, however I do like pasta. I wonder what I'll have for dinner. Wow, this writing went from super deep to super light, topic wise lol. . Grr, I got the Trojan and Mimic virus on my computer. . another lovely addition to another lovely day. Time is up and I have class to go to. Its been nice writing. . Maybe I'll do this again. . Typing of course--I can type faster than I can handwrite, lol. 3. 2. 1. Times up. . Ohh, I can continue writing. Well, I can't now. I have psychology class. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Hi my name is jennifer doolan. . i am writing because i was told to for an assignment. i am not sure what i am thinking exactly. I need to be involved in some type of organization, although i am not sure which one. In highschool i always knew what i wanted to do but here there are so many possibilities that i do not know anymore. the water is running form somewhere i am not sure but it is annoying. i live at dobie on the 23rd floor and we had a fire drill tonight so ihad to run down 23 flights of stairs that was fun. my roomate is really neat we met at summer school and get along great. i am waiting for clay to call me he is supposed to be out of his meeting sometime . . but i am not sure when that is. i also need to do some pre-cal homework and the read more economics but i think that i can do that after class tomorrow and i willb e fine. . i am not the best typist in the world i use to be able to type but hten i go this new laptop and it is funny the keys are closer together and my nails hit them queerly. I just got my nails done the other day i needed a manicure i have been stressed out lately and hands are something that i notice first on people so i like for mine to be pretty. . and it puts me in a bterr mood. I am thinking that i am typing and i have no idea who is reading this and i am sure they do not care what i am talking about but oh well that is ok too. . I like going ot UT it is really big and full of people i feel like i might get lost in the crowds but other than that i think i will have fun . . as long as i continue to meet people. I am not the best friend maker. . i have had the same set of friends since i was in the 7th grade and we have all just gotten along well. Here it is different but should be exciting. My rhetoric teacher does not speak english and i can not understand a word she says. . i haev a paper due on the 13th which is friday te 13th and i think those are cool. Sherene just signed in on the computer. . that is my bestfriend i wonder what she is doing i bet she just got done with her duitemates or something. I hope she is adjusting well to college she is the only one who went to Dallas and she seems to like it so far. I wish that we would have gone to the same school but i know that we wouldhave never branched out if we did. there is no music on i want to turn some on but i have to write and my roomates are studying. someone just IMed me buti cna not respond i am typing. my thoughts are sparing i really and not thinking much at all. . tomorrow i have to go to y dance class at 9:30 then i think i will work out then come back eat lunch take a shower hten go to eco then who knows. . take a nap probably i love naps they are the best things ever. It has been almost 10 min now and i am getting bored with this but i am still going. I called my mom today and she didn't want to talk to me. . well i think she did but she was busy she does not like her job. . well the people she works with atleast. ithink she should get a new one but she won't look myabe i shouldlook for her nad find her one as a suprise. i need to email a&m to see what scholarsips they give out to unmarried teenage mothers. . not that i am that . . but my sister is and she wants to go to school there and i heard this rumor that they give out very good scholarships. My mom wanted me to check on that for her. . A lot of my friends are going to A&M i don't know why they would evr want to do that. but hey it is thier life. my roomate just walked in and is playing with her computer. . it is making some noise but now it stoped. . i haev nothing to think about. I need to work out but it is too late and i am lazy. . oh well Homecoming is in like 20 days and i have to go home. . it is a tradition for the old officers to go back and sit with the drillt eam and watch and stuff but i need to lose weight so that they are not like oh my god what happened to her. . and i need to go shoping for an outfit to wear. . i am not sure what i want though. . maybe i want a skirt or something austinish or maybe clasical would be better. . who knows who cares really . . they are all still in highschool and if they did not like me then they are not goig to like me now and i do nto really care either way. I am ready to go see my mom and my don. . i miss htem very much i feel like i am missing my nieces grow up by being so far away from them. I knwo that they willbe fine but i miss seeing htem everyday likei use to . floppy disks are weird they are colorful but silly if you think about it. who knows i might want to be a computer science major but i donto know what job opportunities that holds. . i am going for being a laywer at the present moment because there are job opportunities everywhere and you do not have to live in once certian place. I could also be a teacher my sister teaches 1st grade she is so cute. I called her tonight and she seemed really suprised to talkto me. . it is not like i am in africa or something just in austin a phone call away. cell phones i hate cell phones well i love them but hty are a pain i wish that all minutes were free and you could tlak to whoever whenever you wanted. all of mymin are for use after 9 well i have 500 daytime min and 4500 night and weekend so i have to talka fter 9 but what if i want to tlak before then, i guess i am out of luck. the first of the summer i talked way to much on mine and my mom got mad at me so i had to cut back. i really hate it when people are mad at me it makes me sad and i have to fix it right away or i am unhappy. . well my time is almost up and i am going to go to bed now "
Tell me about yourself.,"I have never been asked to do anything like this before. It is actually hard to think of anything to think about when you are asked to. This class seems as though it is going to be very interesting. Many people act in strange ways. Maybe this class will help me better understand that. I have a friend that acts in strange ways. Well, actually he use to be my boyfriend. It is so intersting to sit back and watch how he reacts to different things. He sometimes is so hateful and so mean to people for no reason. He has said so many mean things to me and the next day he is sorry for acting the way he did. But the funny thing is, he always ends up doing it again. My dad is somewhat the same way. But he seems more like he has a split personality. It is sometimes very scary. He can just snap sometimes and be a totally different person then he really is. Most of the time it is for no apparent reason. Maybe him being a heavy drinker has something to do with it. I also have a friend that doesn't know how to deal with her emotions too well. She goes literally crazy sometimes. One time I didn't answer my cell phone, and she left the most hateful voice mail. If you would have heard it, you would have thought she was crazy too. But when i confront her about it, she says sorry and can't explain why she did it. I seem to always be stuck in the middle of everything. No matter who is involved or what the situation is, my name always some how pops up. It is pretty aggrivating actually. And I have always lived my life to my dads standards. I never really get to worry about pleasing myself, because i always have to worry about pleasing my dad. My dad wanted me to be a cheerleader. So of course i worked my butt off to become one. He also wanted me to get in to UT. Don't get me wrong, i love it here. But the more i do want he wants the more he ask of me. None of his other children are asked to live up to his standards. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     Well writing really isn't my best ior favorite thing to do but i guess it doesn't matter when you are paying to take your classe huh??? anyway when i write i seem to easily get destracted and then it just makes the time go by alot slower whicch in turn makes it really boring. Well that is why i don't like writtin and when i first heard that we were going to have to do it for twenty minutes i felt sick to my stomach. well enough of that next. . . Lets see. . are you sure that this is confidential,  well if it is then i guess it is ok, i mean this is UT (the greatest school in the world),me and my girlfriend have our anniversary tonight, we have been together for two years as of today. that is the longest that i have ever been with someone, i guess i can talk about my girlfriend because she is the only thing that i can talk about for 20 minutes,  or at least i hope that i can. well in june of 2000 this girl called me and asked how i was. ididn't recognize her voice so i was trying to play it off until she gave me a clue as to who she was. Then she asked how my summer was going and i said fine and asked her the same thing. Then she asked me if i was running like coach told us to do over the summer, so then i knew that she was a track girl. I then could eliminate quite a few considdering that most of the track girls were gorgeuos(&lt;--spelling) and probably wouldn't have anything to do with me. You see i have alot of piopular friend, i mean played football and ran track for 6 years all the way from seventh grade to my senior year. Now i was never REALLY good at either one but i could hold my own, but i guess since i wasn't one of the star ath;etes that i was not very popular in turn myself. So, bvack to the story which hopfully makes this writing alot easier. So i had narrowed it down to about five and then she told me that she got my number from her yearbook that i signed, and i onlyremember signing one girls yearbook on the track team. So i gave it a shot aand asked her   so what about you Rebecca are you running?    she answered yes and then i knew thatr it was her. Now Rebecca is just like me very athletic and have alot of friends that are popular but we are not popular our-selves. so we talked for a while and then i had to go because i was going to eat dinner. so she called me a couple of days later and saying that her and her b/f weren't getting along becase he was in corpus cristi at a tennis camp ((what a geeeeeeeeeeek)  but i guess that i am a geek also)and would never talk to her. so, to make a long story short, they broke up and then on september 12, 2000 is when we officially started to be together and here we are today the rest is just history but honestly i am not the type of guy who thinks about love at first sight and knowing that you want to spend the rest of your liofe with someone but i reall do love her and i can't really see myself without her and she has told me the same. Man is thing almost ove, oh it is well thanks for listining "
Tell me about yourself.,"This morning I went to class at 8:00AM. I was really tired so I guess I should have gone to bed earlier than I did, but I was having fun with my neighbors. After my 8:00 class, I had two more classes, but now I'm done for the day. I was so hungry when I got back at noon that I had to go eat right away in the cafeteria. Now I'm trying to do some of my homework because I have a lot to read. College is more demanding than high school. I never had to read a lot in high school, but now it seems that all of my classes require me to read 2 chapters a week. It's very hard to keep up with. And it's distracting in the dorm because something's always going on that you want to participate in. but when you have so much to do you have to set your priorities. My roommate just came back from class a few minutes ago. Her schedule is very different than mine. She went to the roof to sunbathe and then came back to the room. I really don't want to study. I'd rather watch Fear Factor that I taped last night. I was eating dinner at 7pm yesterday and therefore had to tape it instead of just watch it. I am going home this weekend to see my boyfriend. And then on Sunday I might be going to a waterpark with some of my new friends here. They are nice people. There are quite a few people here from my high school in Houston, but not many people that I was friends with. One of my friends, Sandy, is here and actually lives in the same dorm as me. She lives on the 22 floor though. I live on the 18th. It's really hard to get an elevator from this high up in the building. Sometimes I have to wait almost 5 whole minutes for one. That is especially annoying when you are on your way to class. This morning I was almost late for my economics class because I went to breakfast with my neighbors. I wasn't really hungry but I had a yogurt and some orange juice. Then I felt kind of sick. I made it to economics, but just barely before the teacher started class. My economics class is all the way over in Jester, and I live in Castillian, so it's annoying to walk all that way. Especially at 8AM. Monday, Wednesday, and Friday I don't start until noon though, which is really nice. On sunday I didnt wake up until 2:30pm. That is the longest I have ever slept in. Tuesday and Thursday I have 8AM classes, but that was because I had no choice. I went to the 6th orientation, so I didnt have much left to pick from. One of my neighbors is from Houston like me. Except he's from Kingwood, which is where my boyfriend's dad lives. I like it out there, because there are lots of trees. Maybe one day I will have a house there. I hope to have 3 kids when I grow up. at least 2. I am an only child and hate it, so I don't want my kids to have to be only children. Our power just went out in our dorm room, but only in one of the switches. It happened before and my roommate and I were in darkness for days, until someone came and switched the breaker. We know what to do now, so we flipped the breaker switch and the plug started working again. When I started this writing assignment I thought 20 minutes would be a short amount of time. but now it feels neverending. I'm glad I don't have any more classes today because i'm tired. Two of my neighbors are from the Greek island of Cypress. Their acents are really cool. One of them, Serge, is celebrating his 20th b-day tomorrow, so we are all going to take him out to dinner. I don't know of any cool restaurants in Austin, since I have only been here a couple of weeks. I'm sure we'll find a nice place though. The two Greek guys actually met on the plane ride over here from Greece, and decided to be roommates. They are nice people. One of the book I bought for my Freshman Seminar class is not right, so i need to take it back. I'm glad they give us a good amount of time to return things, becaue it would be unfair if I had bought the book and just had to swallow the cost. Speaking of that, my neighbors and I went to the store the other day and I bought milk. When i got back to the room, i noticed that it didnt taste right. The expiration date isnt until September 18th, but for some reason the milk was bad. So i'm going to have to throw it away. I need to go to HEB and get some groceries soon. I need to buy milk, gatorade, chips, etc. I sometimes get hungry at night in my room and the cafeteria is closed. Today in the cafeteria they don't have any vanilla ice cream. I'm disappointed because that is my favorite one they have. They also have strawberry which is disgusting, and chocolate which i havent had yet. Maybe it's good. I want to find a mall close to here so that i can go shopping. I don't know where many stores are. I did find a target however. That is my favorite store. The other day "
Tell me about yourself.,"     Gregory benjamin's writhing assingment, september 11, 2001. today was a decent day, architeture studio was great, and interesting, although we got a major project due for friday. Everyone in our studio is freaking out over it, but I don't think it would be so bad. In the meantime, I still to to catch up on some reading for my architecture and society class, even though the book is dreadfully boring. I do not want to read it! It is simply boring! Blah, Blah, Blah, building, blah blah blah. I am an architecture major, and this book is boring, that should say something. I wish we could just hurry up and read the little black book, thats Thermal Delight in Architecture that is. It is way more interesting, and talks about actual concepts rather than just buildings in general like some books. . uhhhhh (experiencing architecture). BORING!. On thursday, I have Visual Communication, a class that basicly teaches us how to draw. The proffesor there is annoying sometimes, since he thinks he knows everything and he DOES NOT. I honestly think he is teaching for an ego trip, he continues to put down many of the students, he is lucky he hasn't crossed pathes with me because i will at least defend myself. Anyways, i am majoring in somehing I love to do, so I guess i can trudge though the school. Some of my business friends may make fun of me for that reason, but at least i won't be pulling my hair out because my employes are idiots! (plus, i won't be working at Wal-Mart, the consumer of business). Speaking of stuff i love to do, I love music! I really had a hard decision deciding on rather majoring in music or architecture. . . but since I have been wanting to do architecture since I was like, FOUR, i choose it. . (it all started with legos). . .  On a diffrent note, this page is buggy because when you press enter, then backspace, it returns to the previous page, so when you press forward, it returns to this page, except the COUNTER RESET!!! NOOOOO! there goes five minutes of typing!!! luckily, i am a very patient person :) &lt;----not very formal, hope this isn't read. (yeah right, out of a class of 500? please, i wa sbearly noticed in my high school class of 680, and i knew people there. speaking of people from HIgh Scool, one of them is in this class. Say hello to Jeff Prudon everyone! (this is ment to be read in front of class, but since it probably won't, i might as well TRY to call him out) you get your own personl shout out Jeff! from the Proffesor too! (or whoever is reading). Jeff is a business major, and tries to brag that he will make more money than me. . . but all i say is I LOVE WHAT I DO and, you won't be saying that when you are ready to build your dream house. . AND again, I won't be having a heartattack because my employes are lazy and stupid, because we work in a group. not a hiearchy. &lt;---seems to be spelled wrong. i CAN  T SPELL worth CRAP&gt; the computer has spoiled me with spell check, and grammar check. Darn microsoft, just trying to make us all more stupid over a period of time, so we are just brainwashed into buying only thier products! (oh wait. we already are!) I am running win XP right now :) i do like it, it hasn't crashed yet. . knock on wood. it would crash while i am doing something for class though, with my terrible luck. (spelling? was something wrong?) well. if it wasnt for that back bug earlier, i would have benn finished by now, but i still have 4 minutes left! Hey, maybe that was my bad luck! now my computer won;'t crash because that was bad enough! Muhhahahahaah!!!!!!! ok. . now this is where i really just waste time typing, because i have nothing to type about any more. I guess, i could just recopy my notes i took in your class how aboutt hat! It would be similar to studying! hmmm. . zarconic effect-willingness to finish something. . . zzzzzzz. . . WHOOPS! sorry about that. fell asleep for a second. . actually i didn't. I find your class interesting and entertaining, i don't go asleep in it, i fall asleep in Arch&soc. the chairs are so comfortable, and he shows slides everyday, so he always turn off the lights. . recipe for sleep! now my 20min are up, and i have to sleep myself!   "
Tell me about yourself.,"     ok. i don't know waht to type right now. im listening to alanis morissette right now and the song is about whether she is good enough for anything. sometimes i feel kind of like this; like im not good enough to do anything. now im stumped again as to waht to write. i talked to my best friend kelly yesterday and she is back home now. she went to taiwan for the summer to do an internship. then she went to california to ride a bus back to round rock. but she kept missing the bus back so she ended up staying in california. im really excited that she came back. i havent seen her in like four months and i didnt get to see her off when she left. i was really sad. sometimes i miss having a best friend here. kelly is my best friend in all but she has her schedule and family problems and a lot of times i just miss having a best friend to do everythign with. haley, one of my other friends used to do a lot with me. . almost everything. but this summer she got a job and her dad got a raise so now that she has more money, it seems like she is too good for me. i don't like people like that. there is someone at our room door. haley and i were suppost to go to breakfast one morning and had planned it all out. but then the morning of the event, she had one of her other friends, jennifer, call me and tell me haley couldnt make it because of a doctors appoinment. i was like, why can't haley call me herself. then she tries to play it all off. i don't really have anything to say to her now. i havent seen her on campus since classes started and weve only talked online about two or three times. thats not much compared to how much we used to talk. twenty minutes is a long time to continuously type. i guess its not too bad for people who type slow but for those who type kind of fast, this just makes for a lot of nonsense talking/ typing. ok. this semester im taking karate/ tae kwon doe. its really fun but a lot of work. i signed up for the class because i thought it wouldnt require too much work - aside from the work out - but actually this class has books and i have a three to five page paper due in it. its the only class i have a paper due in this semester. how odd is that?. oh well, it should be fun either way. this alanis morissette music is some really angry music. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     Well here i sit at college and Its kind of weird. IN the next room there is music playing which I like. It makes me excited to go to a concert. , i remember the last concer that I went to. It was in good ole Tennesee, and I was Occumpanied by my cousin. Now she is quite a character and at the time she was attending Memphis University. She now lives in Hawaii, what a tough life. My room is surprisingly clean today, which is surprising. I always imagined that college would be a messy room with clutter everywhere. Actually it is quite organized. I have never considered myself an oraganized person, but as I have grown older I have realized that indeed I do enjoy some sense of organization. My roomate is telling a prettye funny story in the next room, and it leads me to thinking of all of the stories that I have. Coming from Midland, it was quite enjoyable to hear that my teacher was indeed from Midland. A friend away from home you could say. My connection in the bussiness. . haha, I didnt always live there though, I came from the next town and it was quite a change moving there too. Im not sure how it all compares to moving to college, but I do remember that it was right before I entered High school and it was still a major adjustment. I went home this weekend and watched my old football team play. My high school that is. Now we have had a winning tradition over the past few years that included a state championship and playoff trips every year. That is beside the point now, because i witnessed a beating worse than I could have imagined on that friday night. Nothing could go right. I miss football now that its gone, but i also know that the players here are very big and strong and would rip me in half. You never know though, with alittle hard work, next year i coujld step on the field in burnt orange. I have not written much lately, and I know that I should have been writing every day. I once read that writing everyday is the only way to improve your craft. That and reading, but I know that I will have no shortage of reading this year. I have already had tons of reading, but its not that bad. I enjoy reading. I guess this kind of writing is a form of rambling. When your thoughts kind of slow down, its hard to keep writing. You think that you should be thinking of something meaningful. Somthing that would inspire whoever reads this. Inspire or say something meaningful. Its hard to stand out in a place as big as this. With so many numbers you have to be somewhat unique. You can't be too unique or people will dismiss you as trying too hard, but at the same time you can't be ordinary. You have to find the median. The happy place you could say. Not only happy for you, but the place that gets you happy with others. You can't just sit back anymore and wait for somthing to happen. You have to make it happen. As clich'e as it sounds, its true. In the words of Mick Jagger and the Stones,   You can't always get what you want. .   You could say that they truly are wise old men. You can't always get what you want, but if you try sometimes, then you might find, you get what you need. Amen brother. Spoken by a true poet. I have always liked comedy in my writing. Not that everything is always funny, but it adds a sense of connection to the reader. I mean if someone laughs as they read, the work actually does something for them. If they simply sit and read words on a page, then it means nothing. It was a wasted tree. Often times the reader would rather look at a tree than read what is on the page. I by no means claim to be a great writer nor do I claim to make people laugh, I am simply claiming that I like to laugh as I read. I enjoy to read a sentence that makes me laugh out loud. If it makes you stand up and dance, well there you go brother welcome to the world of reading. It is a shame that I do not write as much as I used to. The Ideas are there, I just have not gotten them out yet. They will be there, it will just take time. I guess that is a premature assumption that the ideas will be there. My memory is not the greatest right now, at 19 years old. When I hit seventy or beyond, I can't wait until I have to write my name on my hand just to remember it. . "
Tell me about yourself.,"I just finished working out. It was pretty tiring. I haven't worked out in awhile. It's kind of cold in the room right now. I'm always cold. I dont' really know why. It's kind of weird. I miss Freddy so much. Gosh, this webcam thing might not be so good. It's good that I can see and talk to him, but everytime I do see and talk to him, I just get sad. I want him here with me, but he's so far away. sigh. oh well. at least I'll see him at Thanksgiving. That will give me something to work forward to. Hmmm. My sister's husband is here for the weekend. It's still really weird. I can't imagine my sister married. It's quite strange. But she seems happy, so it's good. I feel bad that her friends are taking better care of her than I am though. Kind of makes me feel bad. But I'll babysit when the twins are due, so maybe that will make up for it. I'm going to work really hard this sememster. I have nothing else to do really. I can't go clubbing or to any parties or have one on one with any guy friends. With is kind of poopy. Because I actually get along better with guys. But it's ok, because he can't do anything either. I was going to write something and I just forgot what. I do that a lot. I'll like so upstairs or something and then I'll forget why I went upstairs. Yeah, it's pretty strange. Hmm. the tv is going on in the background. It's a pretty funny show. I need to go to the bathroom. I just drank a lot of water. But I still have like 15 minutes left on the clock. Wow. 20 minutes is a long time when you're just typiung random thoughts. I'm not homesick at all. I knew I probably wouldn't be. I've always been the independent type. Pipit is a pretty good roommmate. We dont' have the same friends or anything and we dont' hang out really, so I don't think we'll get sick of each other or annoyed with each other. She's out of the room a lot, so that's good too. I'm always on the webcam, so I guess its' good that she goes out or I think she'd be really annoyed. I havent' really met anyone new yet. I guess going ot UT does that to you. You stay in your comfort zone and it just takes too much effort to get out of it. Plus, it's weird. Even when I'm hanging out with friends or something, I'll start wanting to go back into my room to talk on the webcam. Man, I'm such a nerd. Haha, oh well. I think calculus will be my hardest class. I hate math. Ugh, at least I will have no more math after this class. woohooo. well, except that i'm doing accounting, which is a lot of math. But it's like simple math. So I'll be ok. At least no more integration in my entire life. goodness, that will be good to get rid of. Ahhh. . only halfway finished with the time. I tend to do that a lot too. I always look at the time. Even though i pretend not to. I still do out of the corner of my time. It's like I try to trick myself. But it's doesnt' really work so much. hehe. A lot of people are gone for the church retreat. I dunno. I kind of of wanted to go, because I didn't go last year, but I'm just not very comfortable with the church anymore. I feel like all they do is judge you. The pastor and the counselors and everybody just look down on you if you're not a servant leader or if you don't serve or if you don't talk to them and tell you all their problems. Yeah, I think it's pretty dumb. It's makes me really mad sometimes. They have no right to judge. My spiritual life is between me and God and no one else. uughh. Yeah, but I think I'm going ot find a new church when I go back from college. That will be good for me I think. Steven is iming my sister right now. I still feel kind of bad for him. They went out for like 3-4 years and then my sister marries someone else. But it's for the better. THey fought like everyday and he would always cry. SO that's not too healthy either. I miss my doggies too. Dusty Babulee Chen and even Mocha. Awww. my Dusty. I want him here to keep me company. I think Dusty is the only one who knows all my secrets. Because I know he won't tell anybody, considering he's a dog. He's so old already. It's going ot be so depressing when he passes away. That's going to be one sad day. I had a bad dream last night. Freddy dream-cheated on me. Man, that sucked. I was sooo mad when I woke up. I must be really insecure or something. THis is the second time I've dreamt that he's dream-cheated on me. Hahaha. That's pretty funny. It kind of sucks that my boyfriend and one of my really good guy friends hate each other. With a passion too. It's pretty bad. But Freddy has nothing to worry about, that's so gross. Rex is like a brother and I think of him as a girl too. I wonder if he knows?  He should. people always make fun of him about it. But maybe he just think we're kidding or something. Hmmm. maybe we should tell him. Dang, my hands are gettting really tired form typing. I don't think I exactly have the right technique. I wish I still played piano like before. I want to relearn the Chopin song. Maybe I will. . if I motivate myself to. That would be really good. That music class is pretty simple though. I hope these 3 months until Thanksgiving so really really fast. I cant' wait to see Freddy. Man, I think about him a lot. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     Well, this is definetly the first assignment of its kind that I have ever done, I can only hope that i can find enough things to think about for 20 minutes, wait 28 minutes and 30 seconds. That was some math I was hoping to avoid. I wish it wasn't so early, as a matter of fact I shouldnt be awake right now, my next class doesnt start for two hours, nap time, YES! oh wait no thats not right There is still that whole writing thing I'm doing. Come to think about it this is a fairly effective way of making sure that all the students put the same amount of time, and at least a comparable amount of effort in there assignment. For better or for worse. At least the week has begun. In high school thats the last thing I would be thinking early on a monday morning, but it's how I feel now. Upon self reflection though I realize it's not just my insatiable lust for learning that drives me on in the week but rather a combination of that and the fact that I had to work all weekend. Oh well the week will be like a little vacation for me. Looking around the room I see some posters, some course sylabi, some empty cups, textbooks, oh yeah posters. The last one that I got from those irish vendors downstairs, where in Ireland did they say they were from? Can't Remember. Anyway the poster was one I had somehow missed the first time around, hard to imagine since its so darn cool. It's a nice photograph of an H bomb, its really the peice of art that allows the Zen of my tiny dorm room to be complete. right. Ok almost half way there. almost. almost. yes. Good. Even though this is a course assignment I feel very idle, a feeling that I don't particularly like. don't get me wrong I like not having anything to do but I have stuff to do, and was actually set to do it this fine morning. I wonder if the tracing of consciousness would be interrupted by catching up in the reading in my philosophy (abortion, everyones favourite topic). Well of course it wouldn't, but I am sure my ability to trace it would be impaired, and we wouldnt want that to happen. The abortion chapter in philosophy has really gotten me thinking (also thinking I need to finish that first chapter). It was something that I had never given much thought to other then what I saw or read in the media, or touched on in political discussions. I had always considered myself largely pro-choice, but being confronted with logical philosophical arguements has led me to rethink my stance and now I have absolutely no idea what to think about the issue. Of course there are an untold number examples of things that are philosophically logical, but practically not practical (I wonder of unpractical is a real word, yeah it must be, damn). Was there something about us not going back and changing what we wrote the first time? If there wasnt there should be. Except maybe with they dozens of typos I am constantly correcting. three seconds left bye. Continue writing? I don't think so. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I just had lunch, they actually had good cookies at the dobie cafeteria today. i'm really happy i found out that masha lives in dobie too, she kind of bothered me in high school, but i think i might like her now better than almost anyone i met. she's very sincere. i've been more happy than ever since i've been at ut only because i'm on my own. i feel no sense of homesickness at all, like most people are talking about, i'm the way i like myself without my mother who drives me crazy. i don't understand sometimes how in the world we're related. someone just came in. i love that feeling when you feel like your stuffed animals have personalities, the two dogs on my bed could easily be taken for real ones, well kind of, if one of them wasn't blue, maybe. but not really. alex and arif came by last night, two of my good friends from high school, it made me really happy; i was literally bouncing off the walls because i thought it was nice that they just came by unannounced; i don't know why it surprises me because i know they care about me, but when people i care about do something nice; it kind of surprises me. i could never keep a diary, i absolutely love writing more than anything in the world. i want to become a writer, but i always start with something and never finish or am honestly too lazy and that pisses me off a whole lot. i love it and i want to do it, but i don't know why i won't just do it. but diaries drove me crazy; i found myself being fake in them, i think it's easier to show your true self through other words rather than blatently posting,   i'm writing this about myself to understand myself   it doesn't work like that for me. you can see the real me through other writing i think . i downloaded this song called   forever   by ben harper. it is so good; it has the sweetest melody. it's very wierd; i sometimes write poems and just little phrases and i've noticed i use the color blue a lot. like the ocean is blue and once a poem about my parent's divorce and i used something about a blue world or something; i don't know where it comes from. my mother really drives me insane. her friends were in this past saturday and they came back amazed at my independence, how i looked, acted, just my persona and everything and they weren't like that  before about me. and i know that i do seem a little different; like a relief has been lifted off of me ; it's great. i like the person that i am. i spent too much time babying my mother, making sure i didn't say something to offend her or be upset because she was being ridiculous. and she told me how they though all of this and said it in such a way as to take credit for my development and for me being the way i am, sounding great and all. and i just wanted to scream that it is the opposite; it's only because she's not around. she can't seem to figure anything out for herself like that; she thinks she understands so much, but she doesn't at all and i think deep inside she knows she doesn't get it, but it just makes her feel better about herself to think that she understands it all, whatever it may be, just that she's in control, otherwise she wouldn't not let me stay out after ten some nights when all i did was go to a mmovie with my friends; she just does it to be in control and i wish she would see that she's only pushing me away and she already has; i don't think we will ever have a great relationship, not if she tries to understand me and herself. i just wish she could at least understand herself first. i don't want to be like her when i get older and that's partly why i don't want to agree with her on anything because by doing what she thinks she became the person she is and i don't want to be that person. that's sad and i don't like it, but it's just the way i think it is. i really want to go dancing. a song is playing that's called   just dance   and i want to do just that. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     Im tired and i need to wake up tomorrow for my eight o' clock class. . i should probably go to bed. My roomate is already in bed i swear thats all he does i come home from class, he's asleep, i wake up he's asleep. I need to clean my room up, there is a bunch of crap in here. i need to do dishes and laundry and clean up my floor. i wish i were playing racquetball. . but i can't get a court they are all full. . why is racquetball so popular here. ?  I need to go shopping too. i need more gatorade and some more coke. and maybe some more candybars. . i think ill get a coffee maker. . can i have one here or is it against   fire codes    i need a shower too. . im thirsty. . nice cold coke. man i don't know if i can write for 20 minutes straight. man . . eight o' clock. . thats funy. . my roomates car smells horrible. hehe. . aint no mountain high enough, aint no river low enough. i wonder why vilmar was listening to that, i can't wait till this weekend goin to fort worth, i should call creig, i need to do that, see what he's up to and go visit him. i need to order that light for my computer too. i wonder whats on tv, i wonder if the simpsons are on. . maybe ill find out. i wonder why i havent found a girl up here yet, there are thousands here but i can't seem to talk to one of them i just need to walk up to them and be like, hey, whats up. . i don't know though, some of them look snobby. . oh well. . i wonder if im supposed to have the music on or not during this, this is kind of interesting just to type for twenty minutes. i wish this cold would go away, I've been sick forever. what if the phone were to ring would i answer it or what??  ill go take a shower after this. i remember high school, it was fun but im still glad i graduated early. . move on to bigger and better things, i just hope my parents are proud of me. i bet they miss me, i miss them too but not too much, they are only an hour away. . my dog is the one i really miss, i saw a seeing eye dog earlier and was like, i miss my dog, hes awsome, he helped me through some stuff. . why did candice accuse me of breaking andrews windshield, thats not cool i wasnt even there. . oh well, not my problem, he deserved it though he wasnt being cool to britney, whatever, hey she just got online, cool. ill talk to her later. . i still got nine minutes to type. twenty minutes is really a long time, classes seem short here compared to high school even though they are the same length. . thats a good thing though. man im tired, seven minutes, i need a shower, i wonder whats wrong with vilmars computer, i bet i can fix it if i get a chance, i bet its just installed wrong or something, but thats cool, ill see what i can do, this song sucks, change it. . god im tired, been up too long, need sleep, i wonder where jorge went, he took his calculus book and left, i bet he went to go study with raj, yeah. man candice is pissing me off, she thinks i did it, thats messed up, i wasnt even there. whatever   "
Tell me about yourself.,"     consious stream of thinking huh. I don't even keep journals or anything, so this is a little different. These chicken taquitos sure are good. A lot of greese though. Ya know, I really like musicals, but only ones from Andrew Loyd Webber and ones from the late 19th century like Gilbert and Sullivan. Speaking of, that was a pretty good movie. Topsey Turvey that is. I wish there had been more in there from the Pirates of P. But it was still pretty good. I can't believe that I have a lecture to go to at 5 to 6:30. At least is isn't on friday. That would really suck. I should download some songs from the Beatles. In fact, I should buy The Yellow Submarine on DVD. That would be a good movie to have. I wonder what movie I should go see this weekend. I haven't been to the movies in a really long time, so surely something new has come out by now. I wonder what these writing assignments are going to be used for. I'm sure it is used in reasearch on us. Oh well. I need to write Kim an e-mail. I haven't see her or Kate in a really long time. They would probably appreciate that. I'll do that tonight after I finish reading the Iliad. I need to read The Rupublic. I meant to a year or two ago, but I never got around to it. I didn't like my classical civilization class at first, but now I'm really getting into it. I don't know if I really want to bother learning guitar or not. I know it is never something that I would seriously persue, but still. At least I've already learned one instrument, so learning another can't be that difficult. Just learn a new clef and everything else is technical stuff that just takes practice. I might as well, I see to have plenty of time on my hands. Except for in the mornings. The past two mornings I've set my alarm early so I could wake up and get some reading done for class. Too bad that both mornings I've overslept and yesterday I was late to physics. Not that it really mattered. I could not go for the rest of the year and still do fine on the final. It's easier than what I took in high-school. My mom called me the other day. I was at starbucks, so I didn't really talk very long. I'll have to call her back tonight when I get in. I'm sure that they miss me. It doesn't feel all that different then when I was at home. I guess I might be homesick if I was going to school in like Vermont or something like Sara is, but I'm 3 hours away so it doesn't seem like that big of a deal. I guess it helps also that I stay busy. I also really like oldies music, and soundtracks too. I really want to go buy a Phantom of the Opera CD today. I'll see if they have it at Barnes and Noble although it will be an outrageous price. Sarah Brightman is a really good singer. It really helped that she was married to Webber. That must have been a big career booster. It really doesn't see like I've written all that much. There is a lot more goig on in my head, but I just can't get it all out. Some of the musicals that I really don't like are the ones that came out of a post depression era. They just aren't very original and all seem to be cookie cutter creations just for the sake of being made. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I just got back from astronomy class, I have an exam on friday and am pretty nervous about it. I got to really sit down and study for it if I want to do well. I am still kind of sleepy right now since i went to bed kind of late yesterday reading some Philosophy so I could be prepared for today's lecture. I am really concerned with getting really good grades here at the University so I can go on and become a success in life. In the near future I want to become a well known attorney in my home town, Laredo, Texas. I was here at the University of Texas during the summer and I must say it is quite a difference between the summer and fall semester. I guess the amount of people here on Campus is the biggest difference, where it went from 10,000 to about 50,000 from the summer to the fall. I feel it served me well, coming here to the Unversity getting a head start and seeing how things work around here. I hope to continue my studies here and then go on to Law school somewhere, i don't really care where, as long as its in the state of Texas. Oh, my grandmother just called, she is the best grandma in the whole world, she would do absolutely anything for me because am her pride and joy. I really appreciate everything she has done for me, she has always been there for me, whether it be for school, sports, or any or social gatherings. I am really excited, she called right now to ask if I would want to go to New York or Las Vegas. I don't know when, but I sure am excited about the whole thing, I m going to have to sit down and think about it for awhile because they are both really superb places to spend your vacation. My parents as well have played a major role in forming my character and who I am today. If it were not for them, I would probably no be here at UT. They have also encouraged me to do the best that my abilities will take me. They went to all my basketball games throughout my highschool career, they were my biggest fans. I can't wait to see me parents when they come on October 26, my mom's birthday and parent's day. That is also the day of a home football game for UT, I am really looking forward to seeing them and my grandparents when they come to visit me. Umm, my friends and I just got a Sony Playstation 2 a couple of days ago, we are always playing it now, it is one of the coolest things on the planet right now. Today, i have to go to the gym and play some ball because I ve been slacking off a bit, I usually play every day or at least try to if I don't have too much homework. I m probably going to go later on tonight after  I study for astronomy. Right now, i m probably going to go get some breakfast downstairs, maybe some eggs, biscuits, and pancakes.                "
Tell me about yourself.,"     College? I wonder how it will be? I just started it. It seems so nice and easy going as of yet, but I wonder is it something I will enjoy and cherish for the rest of my life.         This is my first time living away from home and the ones I love and care about it. I feel the necessity to show to my peers that I'm not scared and do not miss home. But in fact i miss my home and my sister who I fought with all times. I don't know why I feel that it is important to show to others that i'am not home sick. I can't understand that part of my mind. Is it because I want to fit in the croud? Is it because I want to show others that I'm strong?           On the other hand - I love what I have been experiencing for the past week. I have experienced things I have never before. I never had to do mylaundry myself and now I do that and I find that I like doing it. I have to go to eat myself. At home the plate was always on the dinner. I feel as if I was spoiled at home and that I was given too much. Here I realize that doing things for yourself can be as much as fun when people do things for you. And that to be self-reliant does have its advantages.  I have learnt to handle things on my own. At home, if i met someone I didnt like, it was as if  I ignored them but here I realized that it is difficult to ignore 55000 other students and that you have to adjust and compromise so that you are not the one that is ignored by others . So far I can say that college has taught me more than I thought it would.          College is not the only thing on my mind. I think about my life as a hole-like how will it turn out? How will I manage to survive financially? If I will make a good living in the future? I question myself why I think so much about the future and so little about the present. I give undue importance to the future and not to the present. My thinking aobut the future helps me ruin my present. Things done turn out the way i want them to. I end up sacrifcing every moment that could have been precious over things that i cannot make precious or things i can't control.          But thinking about the future does not take my mind off my past. I question myself if I really do believe in God. My faith in him is torn apart each time a tradegy happens in my life. Losing my grandfather was a big tradegy for me but I coped and realized that he was old and it was his time to go. But when I lost when my father, I really started to think if there was a almighty god since he took away the person I was dependent on emotionally, physically and financially. I decided to look on the positive aspect of life and decided that my mother was still here and so god was not so cruel. But when i lost her at the age of 13, I thought forget God. He doesnt exist. However looking at people who are religious and have faith in god, get everything in life, is making me question of my faith in God. I wonder if he can make miracles happen in my life too?        I used to always think about eating food. But since the past year that it had changed. But i'm back to the way i was. I wonder if I'm a emotional eater? When i was depressed in life, i always resorted to eating. However when things improved i stopped eating and now that i'm sad again, i continue to think about eating. I would love to visit a shrink to get to know if I'm a emotional eater. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     Well, UT seems to be a very confortable place. I like my classes fairly well. Claculus and Physics will probably be the most difficult. Chemistry seems like it will be very easy. . and Psycology. well psycology looks to be very interesting. I talked to my sister last night. She graduated from UT with a degree in psycology. All she told me was,   don't get hooked. we don't need two psycology degrees in the family. and at least someone's got to make the money.   That someone being me. I really love my sister. she is a very unique person. Her life has been a blast. She likes to go places and have fun. . she's got a hugh fun-excited spirit. She's been to Costa Rica. . and now she lives in Chicago. I almost went skydiving with her a couple weeks back when I visited, but the weather got real bad the day we were going to jump. I think it will take me a litle while to totally accustom myself to Austin. it's hard leaving the people I love. . my family and my girlfriend. I am in a very serious relationship. We've been together fro almost a year now. . and I think that we're going to make it through all this time apart and end up very happy together. Man this is taking a long time. I miss my brother. He is a marine. He joined the reserves back in January of 2001. last january he got a call saying his unit was being activated and he would have to leave for Cuba in two days. So mid january of this year he and one of his good high school friends who just so happened to end up in the same unit drove down to Houston. From Houston they were sent to San Antonio for some training. they stayed there for a couple weeks, then were sent to the east coast. . somewhere near the cheasapeake bay area and had to go through a few months of training. They did some pretty neat stuff like riot training and stuff like that. he was able to to call us every now and then, and it was good to hear from him. Then after he was done with his training he was finally sent to Guantonimo Bay Cuba. There he and his unit were stationed for patrol duty. . basically they drive around the outer wall and patrol it. Since he has been there he really hasn't had much time to talk to us. He did take his laptop so he can get on the internet to e-mail, but he isn't given much time to do that. every now and then he gave us a call. He called the day of graduation to see how I was doing. I really wish he could have been there to see me give my speach. It was just not the same without him. He acctually called me here the other day. at about 12:30 at night. so I didn't want to talk long cause it was keeping my roommate up. But He comes home in November. . so it won't be ong before I see himn again. When he gets back my sister is coming down from Chicago to pick him up. . then they are coming over to Austin to see me. . and we're all going to go skydiving!  I can't wait. I'm going back home this weekend. I leave tommorow right after my last class. I'll get to Lufkin around 7:30 in time to see the high school football game. We won state last year. But my girlfriend is in the drill team. . so I'll get to see her perform, I miss her a lot. time is almost over. I've got a little moer homeowrk till I can get to work on a project I've been planning. I'm making my girlfriend a cd. . well actually two cd's. I think she will like them. It felt really good to sleep in a little today. Thursdays are the only day I don't have an 8:00 class!  so I like thursday. well. . time is running down. . only a few seconds left. . so I'll say adeu. . till we meet agian. "
Tell me about yourself.,"MY eyes are closed right now and I'm wondering if I'm doing things correctly. I just talked to my best friend and she is very lonely. I wish I was there with her right now to talk everything out. Its funny how everything builds together to form one big heap of stuff that just explodes in your face. I am looking at the clock and wondering how long twenty minutes is. I want to get this done so can finish all my other assignments. I'm just very exhausted. I've been going nonstop this entire weekend. Just exactly how my fingers are going nonstop as I type words on this keyboard. I feel it in my neck and the back. I just want to go to sleep. . but I must go on if I'm going to finish all my assignments. I'm writingthis with no particular thought about anything. just basically got up and told myself. I think I'm going to do my psychology tonight.   and here I am. I'm tired but I don't want to sleep. I don't want my weekend to end. It's been a long eekend so far and its been pretty good. . If I don't sleep yet, maybe I could squeeze in a few more hours of a break. I've never done a stream of conciuosness writing before. Now I am wondering whether I'm doing this right. How can you write exactly what your thinking and feeling right now if you're feeling and thinking so many things. Right now. . its like a list in my head and it's prioritized, exept the other things keep comimg up like little post it note reminders. I'm also wondering if whoever is going to read this will think I'm insane after reading this. I rememberwe talk alot about the definition of insane in psychology. How can we truly define that word?  I think everyone has a little insanity in them. Just the way the mind works is so complex and the fact that everyone is different makes defining the term   insane   pretty difficult and complicated. It's not like there is a standard of being sane. Everybody is different so how do we know what is normal? I think its amazing how I wrote about absolutely nothing and then went on a rant about the meaning of insanity. or normalcy. I have another thought. My uncle is a diagnosed schizophrnic and so is one of my friends. Are they insane?  How could they be when being schizophrenic is normal to them?  I wonder sometimes if they have a concept of the   ideal normal    I don't think they do because Schizophrenia is their normal. Besides, who is to judge the   ideal normal?    I read a book by Timothy Findley about a psychiatrist trying to help out his patient. Basically, it turned out that the psychiatrist himself was having his own problems. Who is he to judge his patient's sanity when he cannot even judge his own?  I guess this question is a double edged sword. Take from it what you will. I still have no idea. Anyway, Am I doing this correctly?  Oh here's another thought. . How do you know if I'm doing this correctly. it's MY stream of consciousness. Whoever is reading this has no idea if it's normal or insane for me to think these thoughts. For me I think it's normal. I write these kind of thoughts in a journal. I think the only reason why I'm sort of unsure is that I'm actually writing my thoughts for an assignment.  I am kind of enjoying this and it has somewhat put my tension and tiredness at ease. I'm actually kind of relaxed now. More sleepy. I think my 20 minutes is up. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     ok here goes i am starting to write for my psych class and i have just switched my roommate. She hated the three of us and i don't really understand as to why. Well, actually i can because we did talk alot of smack about her but we gave her a chance and she never would reciprocate. So my new roommate is in the process of getting situated right now as i type and i wonder what she thinks about me. She seems pretty cool and i hope she is going to be the kind of roommate i was looking for all along. i really miss my boyfriend. He is working and i wonder if he is thinking about me at the same time as i do. i hope he will call soon for i know he will but hopefully not right now because i am in the middle of writing for twenty minutes straight. I just started thinking about how i took a class over the summer on writing. that was weird. anyway, ozzy ozbourne is on his show right now on mtv and i remember how my dad didnt think it was very appropriate that i watch the show when it first came out. That reminds me, i am upset since he doesnt think that it is appropriate for my boyfriend Joe to come and stay with me until he has a place. i went to walmart today and was getting so frustrated with all the mexican people who were crawling all over the place. It was ridiculous. i wonder what my suitemates are laughing about. this sucks having to right this im telling my roomates about this project thing right now. it is for psychology. man my fart smells. i need to take a shower and dump. thanks for getting my new table. umm ya my lava lamp is purple and clear. shutup erica. hi lerrin. joe is hot says erica. my parents can suck it if he stays. i wonder what they would say if they knew that trey had stayed with us for a week since he cannot find a place in austin. he goes to southwest and i think the people there are incredibly nice, despite what some say. i dread having to read two chapters in chemistry but i know i will do it for i am the determined driven type. the ozzy show cusses more than i do which i think is incredibly weird. i almost threw out arielle's shit today because she made me go through the whole ordeal of moving in again and my mom thought i was pissed at her but i was just upset in general. joe suggested that i throw her shit out in the hall because she was being such a bitch. i wonder if i can cuss on this assignment?  well if not i apologize for my french. some la madeline's sounds really good right about now. i shouldnt be eating so much because you know what they say- freshman fifteen!  erica keeps bothering me about writing this thing i have to fart again. i want to go eat some pringles and ranch dip but then i will feel fat and probably be even more gaseous than already stated. do you ever wonder if people talk technically so they feel smarter as well as to sound smart. why do such people need to feel that way. just go through life doing your own thing and not worry about what others think because in the long run all of that will be forgotten. by lerrin. whats the point becuase the things that matter are all you will remember when you are dying in your bed when you are approximately eighty years old. my biggest fear is that of dying. sometimes i lay at night and wonder what it would feel like not to breathe and that is the scariest thing to me. i hope that i go fast or in my sleep so i don't know that i am consiously dying. did i spell that right?  well im too lazy to go back and change it anyways if it was spelled wrong. i am so happy i finally got my glasses in the mail because my eyes are just dying and i know that i havent been taking good care of them. sometimes i just think that i will get that laser surgery and i use that as my reasoning to my lack of nurture to them now.  I wish my best friend amy would call me. i knew that i would be replaced but i didnt think it would be so soon. i know soccer is a tough schedule at st eds but she doesnt even make an effort to call anymore but i am part to blame as well. im glad no one is instant messaging me right now because that would suck because i wouldnt be able to talk to them. stop interrupting me ashley and stop trying to be cool with kirby because she will figure you out quick and decide if she wants to make you her business. but thanks for running to walmart for me and im sorry i complained all day but its probably because i am on pms time right now. i wonder who is going to read these and what the real purpose is or even if you really do read this. i has made me feel better and calmer that i am typing about what i am feeling and thinking. i am worried about money and my financial situation right now. kirby says we are normal. i think she is really pretty and skinny. i am going to have alot of fun with her. but i hope that i don't get carried away too much because school is my number one priority. i need to get a job and i would be much happier. i don't even have enough for tuition next semester and my parents said they would help but they backed out and i have great resentment for that. i am tempted to ask my older brother but because i am independent i know i will not ask. i hope you enjoyed reading this. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     I'm sitting here thinking about what in the world my friends behind me are talking about, it's pretty funny. we just got finished eating at taco bell, which at the time sounded like a good idea, but i'm now seriously regretting that choice. My friend is quizzing me about what I am typing and it's really messing me up, she can be so obtrusive sometimes. I can't complain though, because I came here to use her computer so I could print off something, so I should be thankful, right? Oh yeah, I'm using proper grammar, hope that wasn't part of the assignment. I just thought about how long twenty minutes is. This assignment could never end. My friend didn't go to class yesterday, so her and her roommate are talking about this, who knew something so goofy could be talked about for five minutes, but who am I to judge, because I do the same thing. Michelle is trying to explain what happened on All My Children to me, not taking into account I am trying to do homework, but the bad thing i actually want to know. I don't feel good, so if this paper is a little weird take into account I am probably delusional from sickness and maybe fever. My nose is running, my throat hurts. Okay now my friend is saying she would have beat me in grade point in high school if she has worked on. she has been saying this for three freaking year, what is the statute of limitations on dwelling?  Oh my God, my nose will not quit running, that makes it very hard to type. You ever realize when you are told to write what you think, the pressure makes it impossible to keep your thoughts on logical things. So instead I just keep thinking how,   I don't know what I'm going to write about  . Now my friends are talking about this show called the rerun show, where they make fun of old shows, this one being saved by the bell. I used to love that show, i can even remember most of the episodes. We are so retarded, I can't believe we are actually talking about this. Remarkably, this conversation has been going on for eight minutes. I actually kept tabs on the little timer thing. Michelle has hairy legs, she keeps annoucing it to everyone, who cares. Although, it is kind of gross because she is wearing shorts. Nobody is talking behind me now so once again my thoughts are on the paper and I am drawing a total blank. When this happens I tend to get nervous and my typing gets extremely bad, so I am having to delete alot. Now my friends are watching me and that makes me even more nervous. Oh I bet this makes for an exiting paper for someone to read, the ranting and raving of a sick, saved by the bell loving freak. Something horribly embarrassing happened to me today, I was telling my friend about how my professor says the word Chicago weird, guess who was behind me. the professor no less, I am not sure i will ever fully recover from that. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     Right, here I am and I have no idea what I'm doing or supposed   to be doing. I'm sitting here in a computer lab because my parents   thought it would be wise NOT to bring a computer the first semester.    That was a ridiculous thought in my opinion. Of course they also   thought it would be wise not to go to Kansas to see Tony this   summer only because I'd never driven out of state before. That   sucked. And I do feel bad because right after I got up here I went to   spend a couple of days with him. I had tons of fun and I really do   love him. I don't know what my parents problem with him is. I mean,   he's so much like my dad, it's almost scary. Maybe they'll warm up   to him before too long. We do plan on getting married, not soon of   course. Heck, it won't even before for like 4 years. I want to wait til   after I'm out of college because there's less financial worries. And   he's NOT rich at all. But anywho. I don't know. I still haven't told my   parents that I got a speeding ticket on the way home from Kansas.   How am I supposed to explain that when they don't even know I went   to Kansas?  I paid for the ticket myself, but it's still going to show up   on the insurance!  And thank goodness, I found out I'm not pregnant.   That would be another hard thing to explain. I mean, I love Tony and   all, but getting pregnant the first time would have totally sucked!    Plus my dad would have killed us both!  Anywho, I'm so lazy. I still   need to do tons of things. I need to go get my work-study job and a   part-time job so I can have money. I still haven't done either. I don't   know why, it's not like I haven't had time. The only things I've done,   really, is hang out with my cousins every weekend and also go out   and do things with my roommate, Nubia. She's pretty cool. She's   nice, so that's a plus. And we really haven't had any problems. I   was a bit worried about that before I moved up here. I was worried   she might not be quite as nice or considerate as she really is. In   fact, we have a pretty cool arrangement. I can borrow most of her   stuff whenever I want and she can borrow most of mine any time. I   like that. Usually I don't get a long with some people. Or rather they   don't get a long with me. They say I'm too outspoken or something.   I never really know. Dang this room is freezing! I wish I had brought   a jacket up here with me. I have found that most of the buildings   here at UT are kept very cold and I'm not accustomed to that. In fact,   I hate it. Even Bryan and Leslie's house is warmer than this.   Speaking of which, I need to take them out to supper. They are   always letting me stay the weekend and taking me places. The only   thing I've done for them (other than spending their money) is babysit   Londyn and Laurin once. I want to take them somewhere nice to eat   or something. But I don't have a whole lot of money. I also need to   see if Anganette and Jake and Leslie want to get together and do   something.  I had so much fun Saturday and Ange's house; it was a   blast. I never knew croquet could be fun. Though, Bryan and Jake   did also make it pretty violent. Just imagine contact croquet. Yeah, I   have a weird family.   I hope Jessica's doing okay. I know she said   she was fine but still. I mean, I know she probably still is pretty   upset. But I don't really know what to say to her, so I don't say   anything really. I like her, too; she seems really fun to be around and   nice (even if she doesn't think people see her that way). I just   realized, I need to call Windy. I haven't spoken to her since she left   for Houston, and she's like one of my closest friends. I miss a lot of   my friends and family. But I really love it up here in Austin. My   parents always said I'd get really homesick, but so far I haven't.   Maybe it's because I do have family up here. I don't know. Whatever   it is, it's working. Shoot! I just missed my Calculus discussion   group, I think!  I'm going to be so dead. But I really don't know where   it is either. I showed up Tuesday for it, but no one ever showed up. I   checked online and it is at 4:30-5:30 and in the room I waited at.   Maybe they had to do a room change for some reason. I've noticed   in some of my other classes that has happened for the discussion   meetings. I need to get my readings done for psych. , philosophy,   and bio. before I get too behind. I don't want to screw up my   chances at getting into the business school and if I don't keep my   gpa up, that's exactly what's going to happen. Oh, I just   remembered, it's only like 19 days until Tony comes down to see   me. I miss him so much. But I hope he's okay driving that far. He   worries me sometimes. But I know he and I will have tons of fun   when he gets down here. I want to show him the capitol, the history   museum, 6th street, take him on a horse drawn carriage ride (that's   so romantic. . ). I don't know what all else there is to do, but we'll think   of something. Really all we have to do is get on campus and pick a   direction and start walking and we'll come to something! "
Tell me about yourself.,"Mondays are not the most exciting days in my weekly schedule at UT. I have a Calculus II T. A. session at 8 am. then comes a three hour gap before my next T. A. session, which is for biology 211. (I have just returned from that class) The T. A. started the class saying that for most people this class will be easy. By the end of the session he was telling us that the class will be quite difficult. I was quite amused by this irony. After the previous statement i took a quiz over chapter one that i had studied quite a bit for so i am quite confident that i did well. There were, however, a few challenging questions that i answered correctly. My next class will be psychology 301. The class is interesting, but i'm not sure i would be taking it if it wasn't a degree requirement. However, after reading parts of the text, i DO feel intrigued by the amount of information available through pyschology.     In my dorm room, i have a clock that has a quartz timer. so it makes a rather loud clicking noise every second. Having a background in music, i tend to want to move (tap my foot or snap my fingers) along with the ceaseless clicking of the clock. This poses a problem when i am trying to fall asleep. I have trouble falling asleep everynight because i can't stop thinking. I seem to be unable to quite down my mind. Eventually i do fall asleep and have to wake up SO early for my 8 am classes monday through thursday.     Last night i did laundary for the very first time completely on my own. I was anxious not having my mother right around the corner to ask if this shirt was for the light or dark load. While i was in the laundromat a few people had used WAY too much detergent and the window into their washing machine was FILLED with bubbles!  One of the guys there tried to justify it by saying that some of his clothes had stains on them and he thought adding more detergent would help aleviate the stains. On the contrary, i think it was his first time EVER doing his own laundary. It was quite a humorous situation. My clothes miraculously came out of the dryer unmamed and very clean. I was happy that the first time went on without any hinderences.     I am currently worried for one of my closest friends back in Houston. Her name's stephanie and i think she is a wonderul girl and a phenomenal person. She is an only child and so her parent push her very hard to achieve good grades and such in school. She has a B at the progress report time and her parents have grounded her until she pulls her grades up. I keep her close to my heart through prayer and i also have pictures of her on my wall to keep my company when i am lonely. I can't wait until she comes to college and i can hang out with her more often.   Many of my friends party often. Not necessarily drinking all the time, but they often do drink. I have yet to go to a party in the university. I hear about date rapes and terrible things like that which frighten me, so i try to stray from any parties like those. My roommate is a member of the Christians on Campus here at the university and i attended one of their meetings (welcome dinners). I must admit that at first i felt very welcome to the organization. I told a few of my close friends back in Houston that i was becoming involved in that organization. However, they told me that they had heard it was a cultish organization and that i should not become involved in such an organization. I looked up some literature about the organization and i was quite worried about being involved in such an organization.     I took a quick nap today between my 8 am and 12 pm classes. Right now there are fire inspections going on at the dorm. I  usually don't dream at all, but i did dream during this nap. I dreamnt that on three different occasions the fire inspectors came to Leroy's and my dorm room. On each occasion they found a violations (of course none of these existed, but were all fabrications of my dreams).  "
Tell me about yourself.,"Ok, well here's the first writing assnment. To begin with, i'm really, really hungry. As is the case, in many college student's lives, i only woke up about an hour ago, and so havent' eaten anything. I've already done laundry though, so I guess you could say i'm semi=productive. I've also talked to Road Runner because they came out the other day and installed the new cable modem in my apartment, but it didn't work. So i tried all the diagnostics that they told me to do, and it still didn't work so i called them this morning. As is always the case, it worked when they asked me to go to the internet, so I seemed like a fool. Well, as soon as we hung up the phone, i tried the internet again, and it didn't work. . I'm pissed. So now i have to use my roommate's computer and a regular internet connection, which is slower than anything else you can imagine.  But on to other things. I'm going to play football with my co-workers from the club on 6th street (the VIBE). It's amazing how you never know when or where a friend might come from. It has always been my belief that a boss will never be a friend, even though it may seem so at times. . . it's really just business. But these guys are different. Perhaps it's the type of business, or maybe they are the one-in-a-million type, or maybe even i'm mistaken, but either way, we're going out to play football as soon as i finish writing this journalistic internet assignment. My best friend had his truck towed yesterday, and the day before he had his wallet stolen, so of course he came to me wanting to know if i'd lend him some money and take him to get his truck back. So, being the good friend that i am, i went to the bank and withdrew 150 dollars and took him to the towyard to get his truck. However, since he didn't have a liscense, i had to sign for the truck, wich only means that i could get into a world of trouble if he ever wanted to screw with me. Apparently by me signing for the truck, my friend could come back the next day and ask for his truck, and since it wouldn't be there, it would be   stolen   which meant i would be held accountable for grand=theft=auto. But i assured my friend that even though he is bigger than i am, i have a lot more friends that are bigger than he is. . you never can tell with people. So back to being hungry again, now my stomach is growling, and i wish i would have eaten before doing this thing. Of course, i am only half way finished, and i grow hungrier as each minute passes. I really shouldn't be playing football today though, because i should be reading all the assignments for my various classes, but what good would that do me?. . . really, i would be a unsocial. . . and besides, i like football better than studying. I guess that's wjhy my grades are the way they are, but who cares, i was a grade worrier all through high school. . i never got a B in my entire li8fe and graduated top 2% (14th of 720). BIG DEAL. I've realized now after 2 years of college that grades really don't mean that much. I mean, yes, you have to graduate and all, but how hard is it to make a 2. 5?  I've failed a couple of classes now, and still have a 3. 2, so you obviously have to REALLY screw up in order to make below a 2 GPA. I guess i shouldn't talk that way, because school is hard for some people, but then again, htat's just an excuse, because i think that anyone can learn somehting, you just have to find the right way to get to them. It's like physics. I can teach anyone physics, it's just a matter of how you explain things. BAck in highschool, my physics teacher was horrible at explaining things, and everyone was alwyas confused, but i would re-explain using every-day examples, and then they would understand. I explained circuit-theory using the large highways in houston (where i lived) as the   circuits  . The cars were the   moving charges  , on-ramps were like batteries, and so forth. Using this method, all the people that i tutored on average scored at least a grade point higher. . give or take. ANyway, i just wish i had it in me to be a teacher because i know i'd be a good one. I just can't see myself teaching. I want to own businesses, and yezs, make a lot of money. I have a business eye. everywhere i go, i'm always seeking a new way to make money, or what business i could start that would flourish. Well, it's almost over, and i must say, i'm not as hungy \as i was at first. So thats it. There's my mind in a nutshell! "
Tell me about yourself.,"     I just came back from the Texas Crew Meeting. I sort of want to try out but in the same time very scared. At the meeting, they kept on saying there'll be a lot of hard work and pain. First of all, I don't think I'm in that great of a shape to do such extreme rowing. The crew memebers said it doesn't matter because they will train you from nothing to something. Second of all, I'm a freshman and doing Pre-Pharmacy. I want a good GPA to start off of. I don't know how I'm going to adjust to waking 5 o'clock in the morning. I guess one of the reason I wanted to join is because to challenge myself and make some new friends. More than 100 people from my graduating class comes to UT now. Before school ended, I got very tired of many of the people. I felt they were very fake. I came to UT hoping to make some friends. I still wanted to keep my old friends though. I truly love them. They mean so much to me. What I'm trying to say is that it's hard to find friendships like that. Everyone on my floor seems nice. They smile at me and everything but it seems like they are always in a rush. Everyone has their own things to do and no time to hang out. Anyways, I'm watching American Idol right now and they just announced that Kelli as the American Idol. I never thought the show would be such a hit. WB used to have this show called Pop Star. Not that many people watched it so I wasn't expecting a great rating for this show. The time is almost up so I guess that is it for today. It was very nice writing.  "
Tell me about yourself.,"Its been 2 weeks now that I have been in college. I havent made that many new friends, but at least I have been trying. I go and meet new people, peobably most of whom I will never meet again, but it's fun still to just go and meet people. I look at my friends from high school, and they just sit around with each other. To me, they don't seem to be getting the new life experience, high school all over again. I think college will be a great time to see new things in my life. Maybe figure out what I want to be as a person. As far as girls, there are many on the campus, but I don't know how many I have a chance with. Sometimes, I feel like my religion holds me back, but I know its something that I want to keep. Its like a respect factor. I hope the girl is out there. I do regret sometimes when I know I should go talk to girl, but instead I just go somewhere else. Im not that shy, but I feel girls always think they're being hit on. THe better thing to do is to go for it anyway, and who cares what they think. THe things that happen during this time in our life, I wonder if this stuff really even matters that much. I mean how much is this stuff really going to affect me later on, or should I even bother with all this stuff. People tell me that it does matter and its all part of life, but I don't really know. I think sometimes I think to much about what other people are thinking. Like act differently towards different people, which something i don't like doing. Also, i think I judge too quickly. I finally opened the door to the my dorm yesterday; stupidly I didnt do so before. I met some people, they seemed pretty nice. I want to meet some girls though, so if nothing else, my confidence will be boosted up. I usually not really needing self-assurance, but what can i say, it is a bit different here. As far as Jennifer goes, well im trying to be friends with her. I think I can be, it doesnt really matter anymore. I think she finally realizes it as well. In life, I think we all make many friends, so it doesnt really matter that much I guess. Also, I noticed when I make a point I think about the opposite as well. Like maybe I should try to stay friends with her, what if she turns out to be a life long friend. I like it when Im just in a relaxed mood, when stuff doesnt bother me. Just chilling and not worrying about anything. SChool hasnt been that bad so far; I know I need to pick it up. Studying hard right now will pay off for me a lot. I guess writing in a journal does help. It makes me feel releaved of some emotions. I want to go to that party tonight, but I don't know how I will get there. Psychology class should be fun, I like the material we are covering, hope it's not too hard though. Im worried about calculus, that class is going to be tough. Sheena, well i don't know about her. She's cool, but I don't know. She's really hesistant, and I don't really trust her. Seems like she's really good friends with a lot of people. I mean I want to make some new friends, meet some nice girls, and make good grades. Simple goals. This 20 minute segment is really long. Im getting tired of writing. I want to go club tonight, i hope i can get a ride up there. I have study too, so if i don't i can always just study. All the same. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     I really don't know what I am thinking at this moment. I am in a state of emotional turmoil at the moment. I can't believe they cancelled Farscape. I see no logical reason why that was necessary. I mean, the show had decent ratings and Scifi had already agreed to pick it up for another season. It has to be something that doesn't concern the show. If I were paranoid I would say it was a big government conspiracy to see how people react to great emotional turmoil. I can't believe this is happening. There is no reason for it. It can't be financial difficulties. Farscape is the highest rated series on the Scifi Channel. This is completely unbelievable. This is a major flaw on  their part. They cannot possibly be sane or sober. Maybe all of the executives are are currrently in the process of overdosing on crack, coccaine, heroine, and ecstasy. They have to be mad. There is no other logical explanation for this. It is freaking stupid. Complete idiocy. This only further proves that the Scifi Channel and USA Networks is truly run by a bunch of apes who have no grasp on reality. This sucks. They might need to be tortured to see the error of their ways. all of them. I wonder if the police are goign to get a  hold of me for writting some of this. oh well, at thist point i really couldn't care. i really have  no idea why i decided tto write this now, i guess i j ust needed a distraction from my own thoughts on this tragedy, at least a tragedy in my mind. Damn, this is so fucking stupid that they are doing  this. This really sucks because i just realized that the time counter thing on this paage that keeps track of how long i have been writing is not working. So i have no idea how long i have been writing. I am quite aggitated now, i have to write for an even longer period of time  to make sure that i write at least the required 20 minutes. i hope a new network decides to pick up Farscape. I really hope so. It really sucks taht it is being canceled after its current season. This is totally screwed up. THERE  IS NO LOGICAL EXPLANATION. Every CEO and executive HAS to be high on something to come  to this decision.  I wonder how long i have been writing?  I guess i t started a t about 1:44. Taht is only a guess though, i reallly have no clue when I started this. I hate not having controll over a situation. I hate that there is not a whole  lot  i can do to reverse the fate of Farscape. I hate that i don't know how long i have been writing this thisn. My leg hurts. I hope all the letters i sent to all of  the higher brain function deficient Scifi and USA Network execs can see the error of their ways and NOT cancel a great show. I would like to boycott the channel but i also watch another series on it. DAMN ME FOR LIKING STARGATE: SG-1!!!  I wish i didn't like taht other sereies so  i could wholeheardedly boycott the sons of trelks.  My sister hates math, she jsut asked me a math question. I don't like teaching people things, i get easily frustrated when i know something and have explain to others.  If the Scifi Channel was STUPID enought to cancel thier highest rated show then  no  other program is safe, the will probably cancel Stargate nec (the assholes) and then i would REALLY have a reason  to boycott. i wonder how long i have been writing this?  Alll of the Scifi execs and USA Network boneheads should be tortured for thieir stupidity in this matter. I would like to be a major contributor in their pain at this moment. Those bastards. how can they do this to me?  how can they do this to my sister?  This blows goats. Damn them. I wonder what it  would be like for them to scream in uninhibited pain and angiush, does this make me a bad person?  I don't think so, not at the moment. They deserve whatever the get. My sister would tie them down for me so i could get to the torturing without fear of them escaping. I think  that time has run  out. I don't know   if it has. The damn counter is all screwed up. If i submit this and i don't get credit because i didn't write for a long enough period of time, i will be pissed. It's not my fault that this damn time thing isn't working. I wish they would reevaluate their decision to cancel. i hope this has beeen and adequate amoutn of time. Well Hell, I'm getting more angry writing about how wronged i have been, like everyone else that they are canceling what is possibly the greates show on the air. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     Today I had a very busy day. At work I had to sort the payroll checks while my co-worker was on the phone and internet all day. I then quickly changed for school and I almost missed my bus. I have to ride the city bus to campus from work. I work downtown, not very far from campus. My first class today was Chemistry. It seemed like the class wa never going to end. I learned quite a bit, but I was tired of taking notes. Then I went to the Gregory gym to work out. I did very good today and I didn't get tired very fast. I couldn't do my normal 30 minutes on the machine because others were waiting. I did start on the exercise equipment, trying to work out my legs and abs. I think I am going to be sore tomorrow. I really need to lose weight. I need to get skinny like all the girls on campus, so I can wear low cut jeans and tank tops. Anyways, I am getting off the subject. After the exercise, I went to Jester to get something to eat. I didn't realize the food was going to be processed. I don't know, it just wasn't what I expected. The pork chops were okay, but I was very hungry. I finished up my economics homework and went to class. I had to call and remind my husband to pick me up at 8:00pm tonight. When I got to my Economics class, my professor didn't show up for class. What a loser. She preaches how we need to be in class on time and how every class is important, but this is already the second day she missed. You would think she would lead by example. Well, what do you expect from a first year professor. And the thought that she can conduct experiments in a class that has more than 200 students. What a joke. I turned in my Lab Report, it was really difficult, but I think I did a very good job. I am proud of my Lab Report, I hope I get a good grade. I met this girl in my class today. I am not sure what her name is, but she was really nice. She is from Dallas. But when I told her I was married and had a daughter, she kind of freaked. Well, she didn't ignore me or anything, but she stopped talking to me as much and she gave her number to the girl sitting on the other side of her. Am I not good enough to giver her number to?  Because I have a husband and a daugher. Well, who cares, her loss. I am going to do really well in this class and she is going to be lost!  That is why I don't talk to anyone on campus. I just don't want to get close to anyone. That would mean I would have to entertain them or call them, or they might even try to use me. Make me do all the work and they get a free ride. I am going to do really good this semester. Of course, I am going to make the connections I need to bring up my grade. You know, go to office hours, SI sessions, ask questions. Meet people who really want to study or just ask a quick homework question to. See, I like that kind of a friendship. Someone who can help me on something I can't work out on my own, then not want me to spend time with them. Maybe I just think of this as high school and its not. I am pretty sure everyone else is here to get their educaiton and get out, not to make friends. Well, after Economics class, I went to the SI session for Psychology. Now this is going to be a hard class. There is just not enough time to study. I want to spend more time studying, but I can't. I try to make room for studying at home, but my daughter makes it really difficult. I wish I would have finished school before I had my daughter. I can't even tell you what I did with my time before her. I really do hope that after I complete school, if I do, that I will be more financially stable. I hope that all this struggling and time away from my family will be worth it. I really hope I made the right decision to put us in debt over student loans for my education. I really want a college diploma. I really wish I wasn't a loser and I could get into the school of Business. But, I have accepted that I will not. But once I get my Economics degree and I become a CPA, that we will reek the benefits. I want a big beautiful house and I want to be able to pay off our credit cards and save money. I don't think that I am asking for much, but I guess everyone wants these things. More about my day, during my Pschology session, I noticed that I really don't know much about the material. I really need to get to studying the chapters. I hear the tests are really hard. Pennebaker seems like a really good professor. He makes us laugh and makes me listen and not fall asleep, but he also gives us a lot of information. (I am getting tired of typing. My hands hurt, but I like the practice in typing)  I want a lap top. I really think that if I get a lap top that I can get a lot accomplished during my study time. I could go to the library and type and not have to wait to use one of their computers. I can't even use our computer at home because my daughter gets in the way. Alex, my husband, doesn't pay any attention to her when I am there. It makes me wonder how they are when I am not around. I bet he is on the computer downloading music and she is in the living room getting into all sorts of things. My things. Or she is sitting in the other living room watching shrek. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Ummm. haven't done this since 8th grade. Thinking always gets ahead of the recording. Allergy's in the air, uncomfortable contacts. Gregg's still here, said he was going to the store. Grammar's gotten lax. Cats on the couch. At least they're not playing. Place is messy-I should clean but I probably won't. Twenty minutes is a rather long time. Is that to get to the truer feelings?  After getting too bored for anything else in 10?  I had a feeling that was the purpose of the 1. 5 hour questionaire. I don't know if I spent 1. 5 hours, but it took forever. And I started the questions too late at night. After answering pages of them I didn't want to back out. Have a   Foam Party   experiment scheduled Friday. I'm peeved that they didn't give you any idea what you were signing up for. Is it necessary not to fill in the participants?  And my vision isn't 20/20. It's not terribly far from, but I hope they don't check and kick me out. I never use this desk (the one at home) and it's filled with papers and trash that isn't mine. I hate stacks of other people's paper. Filled with cryptic scribbles. I don't feel like I can throw it out, but the odds of it being valuable are pretty slim. Strip Tease with Demi Moore is on cable tonight. I've never seen it, but I watch 20 minutes of it tonight but decided to turn it off. I'm trying to watch less crap tv, but it seems like that's all there is lately. I wonder when the new season starts?  I should try to watch something other than Fox this year. It's easy to get locked into one network if you only see that networks commercials. But if I'm only going to watch one, I guess it should be something other than Fox. My typing has gotten pretty decent. I used to type 35-40 wpm, but typing at work has improved that. Most of my practice though is personal email at work. I waste way too much time online instead of working. It's just so easy with the way my computer faces. I wonder how obvious it is though. I'm rambling, but I feel like I'm suppose to be talking to someone. I say   used   and   supposed  . I'm fairly sure that's wrong (but not sure, which is sad). I always say it, and I can live with that, but I type it too, and can never decide if I should make a change or not. Gregg said he was going to the store. I'm paranoid about him reading it for some reason. He just walked up behind me and started to read some, and I asked him not to. It's silly-there's nothing in here that he doesn't already know. And I ramble just like this to him frequently (probably too frequently) and don't have to screen my thoughts much. At least less than with anyone else. But I've always been shy about my writing. I wouldn't even let my parents read the dryest of papers that I wrote, much less one's that were on personal matters. Fish tank in the room, we let moss grow pretty heavily before we bought a cleaning fish. The fish has done a good job though. And it's a good thing we only have neons and guppies, can't kill 'em. Boredom, boredom. Only 5 minutes to go. I wonder how many of these will be read through, and I wonder how many of these wonder how many of these will be read through. Are all people boring like me?  Even witty, entertaining people?  Are there thoughts more exciting?  Does being   on   mean acting like something, not really being one's boring self. Strange itch it my back. I know it's silly, but lately I've felt creaky, like the very mild beginning twinges of getting old. I should excersize. I know I should. I get winded going up a flight of stairs, and I can stand to lost 15 or 20 pounds. I try to diet even though I know the sucess rate from dieting alone (calorie restriction) is dismal. And the Atkin's diet thing. Although it evidently works for many people, it's obviously targeted diet in my opinion. That may not be fair, but from my own observations women are much more likely to eat a carbohydrate based diet, while men like to get more calories from meat. Atkins calls a carbohydrate diet unnatural and unhealthy. And that's ludicrious. Perhaps his diet is healthy, but it doesn't follow that the other is not. Only five seconds left, does the timer stop by itself?  Went over time, but couldn't resist finishing the sentance. Shave and a hair cut, two bits.        "
Tell me about yourself.,"     Well it is about 1:20 in the morning and i have been up studying for a few of my classes. I keep weird hours on my classes rather than try and make time for them during the day. I guess i enjoy my leisure time as well as my study and i try and make time for both on the weekends. I almost feel like i should have a big sign in my room somewhere saying   hey you should be studying something!   ha. . well maybe not but i like to keep atop of my studies and i don't want to slack off on any of my assignments. The joy i get from lounging around is multiplied by ten if i fall behind on an assignment or if i feel that i might get a   B   or   C   on a test rather than an   A  . I like the fact that i know i will get what i deserve out of my class by what i put into it. So because of this i try and make sure to do the studying. Right now my grades are very important to me. I feel that in the long run they will distinguish me from all the other people who are just trying to get thru college and then maybe find themselves in life. Where as i have already gone the route of finding and exploring myself as well as rationalizing the things i do for quite sometime now. My success i know will not just depend on my degree or simply finishing college but also many other things that i feel i might be able to control. Understanding the aspect of control early on or trying to get a grasp on my life made me realize that there really is no control on life. You must prepare yourself for the best that life has to offer while along the way being happy in the process. Right now it is to be the best that i can be and to get the things i want. So in order for me to do that i must do well in school and in Business. My happiness is might be put off alittle right now by my 15 hours of school but the sacrifice to myself will pay off in the end. It makes me wonder who really is going to read this and what you must be thinking at this point. Ha. . what a character. Well no not really just a determined man. I like doing things that people have told me i had no chance in doing. When i moved here from Colorado i had an agenda and for the last 3 years i have checked off everything that i have set out to do. It gives me comfort in doing what most people can only dream of and never make the attempt or the sacrifice to get it. Blink. blink. don't know. . haha. . Feeling the affects of sleep deprivation right now. . my eyes are feeling alittle heavy and the distant sound of a car alarm is making my mind drift. I see soft white cotton pillows floating around in the back of my mind with baby blue sheets. Man i need to get some sleep. I took this writing assignment as a challenge to be honest and type whatever came into my mind and i guess that this is what i am doing exactly to the   T  . Many different things keep up at night, school, my grandmother in the hospital, the different appointments that i have at school and the week coming up about 9/11. Wondering if my grandmother will be around then and if she is what state of mind will she be in. Which is wrong for me to say seeing as how she just had a stroke and part of her brain is not functioning. The doctors say that she does not feel a thing. I really would like to believe them. It seems unfair that she should live this long (92 years) only to be let to die a little every day. The doctors say that she has a strong heart for age. . well hell we have always known that. . but this one time i wish it was not so strong. . i miss her laughter and knowing that her mental capacity was just as strong as her heart. I miss her already even though i know that she is still with us. Bright red eraser. . why did they make them that color? why not white or blue or yellow on the end of pencils? It seems to me maybe it is the properties of how they make erasers that cause it to be the color that it is. Trying to stay with the typing and trying not to drift off. . i was hoping to get another experiment done after this one but i think that maybe i might try and sleep. I have got to get up earyl and get one of my vehicles registered down town. Maybe that is part of this writing experiment. Have us write this with the knowing that eventually we will turn it into something that we know or think that someone will read. So when we write we eventually get to that point of writing. The mind is laying out a thought process or maybe it is all just random and i am thinking out loud with my keystrokes. I read somewheres that in a thousand years the English language will be dead and that new ways are being created to keep individuals away from any toxic or harmful waste that might be around. So they are trying to create a visual sign for them that will be some kind of universal signal for danger or trouble or death. Hmmm. . seems weird that in time our language might go the way of the Egyptians. . times up. . night. "
Tell me about yourself.,"      I am a little irritated right now. I just did this thing for about 5 minutes and then my computer just like shut off!  I cannot believe I just spent those five minutes only to just have it all erased. Things like that irritate me a lot. I always just hate having done something and then it being useless. I guess that could be kind of an insecurity but yeah. I am not going to psychoanalyze myself. I guess since this is one of thise things that could do that for me. I wonder if this will get picked to be read. Probably not. Its getting done way early. I can't really see the reasoning behind the whole stream of consciousness thing. I mean yeah you can track your thoughts but couldn't you do that just by paying attention to yourself?  I dunno. just one of those things I guess. Moving on then. I'm eating a rice krispeys treat thing. I get hungry when I am irritated. I have to wonder how evolution made us that way. What is the point of eating when you are irritated. Shouldn't you want to do stuff?  that would make sense in the whole flight or fight mode sense kind of way. I am glad i have an apartment it doesn't smell here and the neighbors are really nice. Of course  you don't make a forced acquaintance like you would if you lived in a dorm I guess but this is more private and I can work on the bills and homework alone. Maybe I'll go out tonight with one of my new friends. I don't have plans and I'm not really interested in going to the game, as if I had the money to go anyways. Money is going to become an issue later. I should try and get a job this semester but i just don't want to get burnt out on my first semester. I don't really need the money but it would be nice in case of an emergency. And who doesn't like a little extra spending money?  I don't know i need to find somewhere close to work but i don't want to have to work as a cashier again. I hated doing that. Not as much as working as an area host(janitor) at a certain theme park. Not at all fond memories of the sausage shack and the bathrooms accompanying it around high noon. Its stupid how people have no real common sense when they go out to have fun. Honestly, who doesn't realize that a urinal is not made to be pooped in. It would hate to know the person who didn't understand what a urinal . URINal, is for its use is right there in the name c'mon people!  But yeah my lips are chapped really bad. I should find my chapstic otherwise I'll smile at someone and then make a weird face because I split my lip. Eminem is on now. Repeat of the MTv Movie Awards. He's not really a bad rapper assuming I can even even judge that music. But he honestly is about the whole shock value of his music probably. Just like many of his little fans. I have a really nice view of the septic area behind the aparmtments an dthe little balcony shows a wonderful scene of the vagrants coming out of the woods. I got that last part from a couple of my neighbors. The one seemed really witty, another was very . bubbly, and of course there was the one with a boyfriend. They are really nice I hope to get to know them more. Wow its almost time to stop the whole stream of consciousness. Just four more minutes. My nipples itch. I think its because of the new shirt I'm wearing. Wow that was kind of out there. You know what's funny assuming   you   were a person and could reply that is. I hope I don't become one of those people who just talks to themselves all the time.  But the funny thing is that I have a pencil sharpener in my room. Yet I only have mechanical pencils  That seems kind of pointless. Oh that is kind of punnish. I really need to find a book to read. I hate not having something immediate to do. Doing nothing is just not a strong suit. I miss my family now that I think about it. I think I'll give them a call today. I don't want them to think I don't care about them even though I'm away.  "
Tell me about yourself.,"     I'm sitting in the library not much is going on in the building or in my head. I was hoping to have more to type, to be more prepared, but this is the best I can do with how ready I am now. It's very quiet, just the hum of my computer and that of one other guy's, people coughing, talking below a whisper, throwing things noisily into trash cans . . . or perhaps it's only apparently noisily, as this is a library, I've been here a while and thus am habituated to the relative soundlessness. Habituation is interesting, it's as though any noise could be going on for a day or so and after the first couple hours you'd hardly pay attention anymore. You'd only recognize it again once someone pointed it out, then it'd fade. So much is like that, for instance, it is only through feeling sad that we can fully appreciate our times of happiness. Only through experience of evil that we can differentiate good from it. That which makes things most apparent is contrast. I could draw you a picture of a polar bear in a blizzard or a black dog in the middle of a dark forest and you'd probably see a white sheet of paper or a black sheet of paper, respectively, but if I drew you a picture of a grizzly bear in a rainstorm or a green dog in broad daylight then I'd have to actually have some artistic talent, which I don't, but once again, it's only through viewing my doodling and bad sketches that you can recognize the masterpieces of van gogh, rembrandt, escher. Escher's an interesting one, his pictures representing in 2 dimensions that which is impossible in three, or simply tesselating objects that wouldn't normally be juxtaposed . . . it's like listening to bach, the crab cannon, sorry to use the stuff straight from GEB, EGB, but it's a great book and the several recognitions today of godel's theorem in action around me have brought it to mind. Even if you're prepared for everything, even if nothing can catch you off guard, something will. With any logical system that is sufficiently complex, all theorems within that system are not derivable using the logic of that system. The anomalous terms, numbers, theorems, whateveryoulike, are put into a new group, and labeled, still underivable, but at least named. But what is to name something?  Very far from actually understanding it. So we separate those out, create a class for them, etc, and say we've rendered godel's proof useless, but he answers, pulling yet more whateveryoulikes out of your system, causing it to constantly divide, in infinite schisms rendering scientific method, mathematics, logic, thought, computers, money, the world senseless, but hell sartre, camus, kafka all did that in their own ways. Murphy and Godel, two sides of the same coin, one the observationalist who saw that the other's mathematical explanation of Murphy's law was true. I hope that makes sense to someone besides me. How can anyone ever trust words?  They give us so little to go on. Try describing an experience you had to someone else. They'll hear your words, take them to mean something, then perhaps if your experience was interesting they'll attempt to pass it on to someone else, but all they have to go on is your original words, remembered imperfectly, thus if they're asked to elaborate they cannot. Divorced from your own head, your own experiences this same thing could happen to you as an individual as opposed to spanning people. The impossible to deny separation of the observer and the observed defies the unity each of us feels exists in the world. I am the universe and I act in the universe. I can view only so much of it and wow this has gone to quite an odd part of my head. Let's try some meditation. You hide, they seek. Sound should precede action, light should precede all, but that is not always the case. Instantaneous data transfer thru entanglement disrupts causality. This is as true now as it will be now. Hahaha. oops. I don't know what it means. My ass hurts. I should shift or something. That's better. I think I forgot what I was supposed to be thinking about. Don't take points off, please, haha. I still don't know what it means. Any of it. I've done this type of thing before but the time I remember best the words that came out were absolute nonsense. The goal was to choose your next word based on how it sounded being connected to the previous words. Phrases like 'other ear' came up, each word having a similar 'er' sound in it, and other odd things like that, and that one I was handwriting and somehow, I still can't explain it, I just got stuck repeatedly, perhaps recursively, writing the letter ddddddd "
Tell me about yourself.,"     Why I'm I here typing when i could have gone and eat? When   does my next class start? I hope my mom left me some food for   tonight. I got to call my friend to go work out. My stomache is   growling. That girl over there look so cute, i want to go up to her and   introduces me, but i'm scared. Maybe i'll have the gut next time. I   can't wait for this week to be over with, but I'm not ready for the exam   next week. what do i have to do for tonight?  Do i have to pick up my   brother today from football? What time is my fraternity interview. I   hope i get accepted. What's the guy next to me is doing? This writing   assignment is so long!  I don't know what else to write. Oh,   tomorrow is the one year anniversary of the terrorist attack on the   world trade center. What i would do to stop terrorism and Bin Laden.  I can't wait for the fall semester to be over with so i could go to   Californnia and visits my cousins and relatives. I missed them so   much. I'm so exhausted from weight training class. I'm so tired.  What worse is I have to walk all the way from Gregory Gym to the   Union going up so many steps. I walked so much. Why does all my   classes have to be so far apart? Ten minutes left. hahaha. When   does the fall semester offically end? Hmmm. . Another pretty girl   just walks in. Of all the student at UT, how come i only a couple of   cute girl? Why is that? I'm i in the wrong building or at the wrong   place or something? Where is all the pretty girl at? Oh. the cheddar   lover combo from Wendy's sound so terribly good right now! I can't   wait for this assignment to be over with and go get one from the   Union. I wish i have some kind of super power sometimes. Maybe   the power to go to the future, be back in time, super strenth, be   invisible, shape shifter, be able to fly or have super power eye sight. I   wish i have all of those, hehehehehe. Hmmm. three minutes left,   what else i'm i thinking. This assignment doesn't seem so bad after   all. I wish all the assignments is like this!  My body are so sore. I'm   gonning to go to sleep once i get out of class today. Man, i got a lab   to do right after class!! That suck. Oh well, got to go. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I really don't know which house I liked best. The first one was alright but I don't know if I would like living in a duplex. What if they are annoying or out of control? I liked the second house a lot more. It was huge and nicely kept but it was a little pricey. We would definately need at least like 7-8 people to live with us to bring down the price. It'd be cool if Emily and Singer would live with us but I don't know if their parents would like the idea of them living with guys. It would definately hook us up for meeting girls and what not. Better parties for sure. I'm so tired, getting up early for that stupid ticket drawing that got sold out really sucked. And now we don't even have tickets so we woke up early for nothing. I have so much reading to do in all my classes but I know i'll be fine. I need to call kathy back too. I wish she could have stayed up here longer but that's not possible so there's no reason to dwell on it. I wish i had more time to take a nap before our next meeting with the other realtor. But i am pretty excited to see some more houses. Supposedly there's a nice one across from the frat which would be ideal. We need one close to campus too because i don't know if i can afford a car next year. I'm going to have to find myself a big paying job this summer. Damn my head is killing me. I really should try to take a nap. I'm really pissed about my phone. I don't understand how a top of the line phone can lose its battery in 10 minutes of use when it's supposed to have 4. 5 hrs worth of talk time. If this new battery doesnt work im going to lose it. I don't have the patience to be dealing with this crap. I need to take a shower before i leave tonite because there won't be any time before the party i don't think. Why does my room not get any cooler. I'm sweating and im just sitting here typing. I have a horrible taste in my mouth, i should go brush my teeth or rinse my mouth with listerine. How have only 9. 5 minutes passed. I'm starting to get a little tired here. I really didnt like that first realtor. He kept rushing us and stuff and he just seemed annoying. But if he has the house we want i won't deny him the business. My blisters finally healed so wearing those boots won't kill me anymore. My cold is starting to go away too which is good. I hope Emily is taking good notes in chem because i just couldnt make it today. Way too tired. Whatever i'll give her a call when class is over and see how things went. It's not a bad class its just really basic and easy stuff right now that i remember from high school. Plus it is a pretty long walk. Ok 8 minutes to go, not too bad. I'm pretty hungry now that i think about it. I would love some spicy wings from pluckers. But i have to cut down on expenses so there goes that thought. Casey was hilarious today when we were trying to get donations for charity. I couldnt stop laughing. That was fun. I need to get my plane ticket for winter break. They are so damn expensive even though it's so far away. I should do that today or tomorrow so that they don't get any worse. OK 5 more minutes it's almost over. My fingers are starting to cramp up a bit. And my hunger keeps growing so i hope these minutes go by fast. I hope everyone still takes the bus to dallas for the game because at leat that will be fun. Rima said we may be able to stay in her when we go so that would be a sweet deal too. Craig just got out of the shower. I need to take one too. I need to do some laundry as well soon becaus my basket is starting to fill up. I got to find someone to do it with so its not so boring. OK im too hungry i need something to eat now. Twenty minutes is definately longer than i thought but i guess it is almost over. About 1 minute to go. . nice. Josh got some really cool things to hang in our room today. Definately gives the room some more character. 30 seconds left. 20 seconds left. 10 seconds. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1 bye  "
Tell me about yourself.,"I wish that I could type more quickly, so that I would be able to follow my thoughts. I should take a typing class like don said he did. That makes me think of my trip to Mexico, look. there is a picture of that trip on my desk. I am glad that I got into san jac!Hopefully the spirits will accept me. Man, I forgot to put my name on the back of that picture. I hope that they do not disqualify me for that. I don't want to get rejected. I cannot believe that I got those scholarships. I am glad that I did, because Lauren did. I got more proportionally than she did. It shouldn't really matter. Well it does. I can hear the movie on behind me. I love the 80s movies like this one. I like the kevin Smith movies too. Jay and Silent Bob was disapointing. I liked Kate and Leopold. I wish that I could have true love. I do not think that I really believe in it any more. I want to, but I can not trust other people enough. I think that it is my father's influence. He always says that you can fall in love with anyone that you choose to love. I Hate that. I hate that he told me that so many times when I was young. I hate how my parents fight all the time. I hope that they do not get a divorce. That would be horrible for ray ray. Poor guy. I do not even know if Daddy cares about him. I know he loves him, but he does not really like him. I can try to make up for that. If we were orphans I would take care of him and lauren. I think that i wish that we were orphans sometimes. Just so that there was something worthwhile in my life. I have not done anything in y life. There is almost nothing different in the world because of me. This is a depressing line of thought. I should try to be happy. I always think that unhappiness is a weakness. Another gift from my dad. He does not even know that I think about that stuff. Xena is awesome. I wish that I had some kind of powers. I think I might be able to have paranormal dreams. Maybe I just want to so badly. I wish that magic was real. I would give alot to have some real magic in my life. I think that I am starting to doubt my faith. I do not feel very bad about it either. I stayed up till six am last night. I hope that I can sleep tonight. I am going home next weekend. Some people are not going home for a long time. Just at Thanksgiving. MMMM thanksgiving rules. I am glad that my family loves and misses me, and that I can miss them. I hope that I can meet alot of people while I am here. I want to be in love. I want to have adventure. And I want everyone to know it. I wish I could be famous, I wish I could be a hero. I hope that I am strong enough that I could be a hero. I am afraid that I am not strong enough. Should I keep acting strong, or be what i am. I am afraid that my friends will find out that I am not what I seem like. I wonder if they are really what they act like. I should not lie anymore. Not, actual lies, but weird ones. I love some of my friends. I used fatty. That is wrong. I have to be a better friend. I used her to make friends with her roomate. They do not like Teresa anymore for some reason. I hope that I do as well as I can here. Ihope that as well as i can do is enough.  "
Tell me about yourself.,"     I really don't konow waht to write about and I have already   misspelled like a lot of words because i am a horrible typer. Man i   type slow. I havent done anything all day adnd it has been quite   great. I was in this exer experiment and a it was totally boring. It was   called I'm on fire , but it had nothing to do with fire. I sat in a little   room. You know for days I have been thinking to myself about e what   I was going to write on my paper and actually it is a lot easier than i   thought. We read Faulker senior year and we had to write in the   stream of con science so that is why I am not correcting my   mistakes because she won't let us . She said it would stop our train   of thought. The people next to us have to loudest music. I am in my   room adnd I can totally hear the music perfectly. Good thing that they   listen to music I like. Twenty minutes is actually a real long time   because I have been typing for awhile and it is like only 2 minutes in   to the thing. I think I miss hiome. I am from a small town and Austin   is huge. It is different a,and I do like it. I get sick of people asking me   though.  Do you like it here  ! I mean I have only been living here for   what like a two week time period adn already they expect me to   know if I enjoy it. I haven't even gotten out and done that much. Is   gotten a word. Oh well! I really feel weird in some of my class too. I   mean I graduated with 171 people and that seemed real big to me. I   knew everyone and it was nice. I came to UT because I wanted   something different. i wonder who is at the door. I t is John. He owes   me money. He is from Paris too. Oh I'm rich i got ten dollars that is   sad. Bye John ! It was our friends birthday adnd and we spilt how   much we gave him. I gave ten adnd John gave ten. Anyway this is   boring. I thought this would go by much faster. My room mate Valerie   types fast. I can hear her as she talks on AOL messenger. I moos   every time she pushes return. That is a little annoying , and I think it   is funny because she laughs at the screen. I know she is laughing   at what someone is saying , but it is funny. What am I going to wear   tonight to my Lonestar meeting. I want to look nice ,but not too nice   you know. I am talking to this computer like it is a person and not   where I do assignments. I am also typing like I talk and not how I   write which is a little weird. I think it is funny because I'll be typing   one thought and another thought will pop in my mind. Last night my   Kiddie Lit class was fun. She read us children's books which is   awsome. I think it would be cool to write a children's book adn draw   pictures for it. My hands look funny when I type because I have to   hunt and peck. I took a typing class one summer ,but it didn't help.  That sucks because I paid money to learn how to type. MOO MOO is   all I hear and that does get old. I hope JHohn did not think I was   rude since I didn't stop typing. I bet he understood because I said it   was for school so he probably doesnt mind. I wish I had one of my   mom's cookies. She is mailing me and my friends away at school   cookies. She said she put them in the mail today. My room mate is   funny. She makes funny sounds like EEK and eats foods I have   never seen before. Oh Well. I typed my mom an email today to give   her a bible verse because she sends me one everyday. My room   mate just left to go to class. I am glad I do't have class today. I hate   grammer. i never know where to put a comma dn and when I stop to   type a word with a comma or some form of puntuation, I forget what i   was going to say. Hey you can back space on this and correct   mistakes. Oh well to late now. One of the girls in class said she   backed spaced and had to start over , so i thought you couldn't do it.  It is weird I just now wrote down that you could back space when i   just backed space like forever ago and didn't think anything of it. I am   thinking nothing. Is that possible? I did not think your mind could just   quit working like that , but it is possible to be blank I guess. Well, I   like this assignment. it does not require that much thought. That   beep on her clock really hurts my ears . It is like a dog whistle i think.  I can't hear a dog whistle ,but is what I think one probably sounds   like. I wish I could meet more people. At my school back home I   know everyone. i am the funny loud girl ! Here though I am all quiet. I   wonder why? It might be that I have known the people at home for a   long time , so I am comfortable around them enough to be crazy and   be be me. Here though I don't know any one and I think i actually   smile less. Is that normal ? I hope so or not . It really doesn't matter   since that is just the way it is . I keep thinking about this boy too. I   guess I'll write about it. i have been trying not to think of him, but I   can't help it so here it goes. There is a guy here that is like eight   years older than me who is from my town. He is like best friends   with my cousin, Will. They both decided to come to UT, but Will has   already finished and Jobie hasn't. Oh my I said his name and I hope   no one sees this. This is kind of like a journal which is weird to me.  If people read my real journal they would think I was crazy because I   only write in it when I am mad usually. I write sometimes when I am   sad or happy, but I usually write or draw when I am mad. i was mad   at my ex boyfriend one time and I drew this crazy picture. He saw it   and said the person on it all beat up was probably him. He was   trying to be smart to one of his friends or funny. Whatever he thinks   he is. Sometimes I wonder if I still like him a bit even though I   should not because he is a liar and a cheater. We used to be best   friends before we went out. Don't ever date your best friend because   it always ends up bad. I thought he wouldn't cheat on me even   though he has cheated on other girls. i thought he wouldn't because   he would have respect for me. i think it is funny that every time I write   the word respect that I have to sing the song to get it right. Oh well I   guess he didn't have any respect for me though because he did.  That is wierd that I can still get mad about this and it has almost   been a year since we broke up. I'm glad that we did though even   though at the time it sucked. Matthew Cass is fine. Where did that   come from. Both my ex boyfriend and Cass go to my church ,so it   does kind of make sense that that thought popped in my head.  Haha! I have liked Matt since the 4th grade when he lived down the   street, but then he dated my sister. THey are the same age. She   was like 12 ,and she broke up with him by playing an Ace of Bass   song. That is like froever and a day ago. That is weird what you   remember. I can like hear the people around me. these walls are   super thin. The guys above us do the weirdest things like they make   weird noises. It sounds like they are taking golf balls and dropping   them on the floor. It is weird. They do it at random hours in the night   to which is always funny but annoying I think. Most of my friends are   guys so I don't find their stupid things that annoying because I would   probably do it too. i am not like a tom boy or anything though. Hey i   only have like five mintues though. My two guy friends that came with   me down here joined a frat , so we don't really get to hang out as   much as we used to. They are at some party getting drunk or on   some camping trip. before we came down here , we all agreed we   didn't want to go Greek ,but I guess they changed hteir minds. It   doesn't like make me mad or anything it is that I feel a little left out   sometimes. It is not their fault. i don't really want to go to the parties   though because I don't drink. Is parties with and   i   or an   s  ? Oh   well! I don't know about going Greek. I mean I am sure it would be   fun ,but I am not sure it is for me. Sometimes I think I am too fat to   join a soroity because all you see is really small girls pledging. It is   like trying out for cheerleader. i am not huge or anything. I used to be   though. I lost like sixty pounds in high school, but I am still fairly a   big girl. I look a lot better than I used to though. My sister has just   lost weight and now she calls me fat and tells me I should lose   more. She doesn't always come out and say it , but she will poke me   or laugh or tell me that i can have her old clothed because they are   WAY to small for her. She says they would fit me because I AM SO   MUCH BIGGER. That makes me so mad. I wear a 12 usually and   that is not that big. Marlyin Monroe wore a 12 and people thought   she was beautiful. i am real curvy like her too , so some clothes look   funny and it can be hard finding the right fit. It will either fit in the   boobs and be too big every where else or fit every where else and   be too small in the boobs. Oh well I really don't care because I   usually wear blue jeans and a shirt from the goodwill. I love that   store. Sometimes you can find the cutest little shirts in there and   save money. I haven't shopped in awhile though because now I am   a poor college student. I like college though it is different than high   school in a good way. The professor here are so funny because they   can say what they feel and classes aren't that hard. i am almost   finished because I have like 20 seconds left. I thought I would never   finish and my fingers would fall off. I tried to write fast at the end ,but   now time is up , so I better quit. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, you can tell it's Friday because there is no one in this computer lab. I'm very tired and ready to go to my car and go home. I don't know why I am so tired because I didn't do anything last night. I just got finished with my communications class. I am kind of worried about the interview because I'm not really an expert on anything. And we have to dress up. I walk around this campus all day and get gross, hot and sweaty. I don't want to dress up. My parter is little genius boy with a plan II and finance major. That kind of depresses me because I like to think of myself as smart, but everyone elses major seems much harder than mine. It's still a lot of work, but I just don't think I am as smart as I used to be. I am supposed to go home this weekend, but just don't feel like driving for two hours. Then next week we are going to Louisiana for Dad's birthday. Corey is thinking about going and I just know that Mom is going to cause a big stink about us staying in the same room. And then what if they don't like Corey. I know they won't like the earrings and they'll think he's too old and he works at the bar. It's just one thing after another. Never ending. I gave the lady that hit me the estimates for the damage. six hundred or fifteen hundred dollars. Which one would you choose?  That's another thing. I just got my car back, barely had it for two months, and some country club bitch that can't drive has to hit me. I don't even care about my car anymore. I don't feel like waiting for it to get fixed. I used to obsess about my car, but too many things have happened to it.   Today is Friday the 13th. Kind of spooky. Sometimes I am more superstious than other times. I still want a black cat thought. Wednesday was the Sept. 11 World Trade Center anniversary. It was a sad time of course, but I'm getting tired of thinking and hearing about it. I know we just can't forget about it because it's on every t. v. and every newspaper cover every time you turn around, but I think people are too worried about it. I know I was somewhat scared that something was going to happen on wednesday.   Rory keeps calling me and I haven't answered the phone yet. I feel bad because he keeps saying that he just wants to see how I'm doing and if everything is going o. k. , but I really know what he wants. Booty call. It's a good thing to still have those connections, but I so over that right now. Right now I'm into Corey and I don't want to do anything to hurt him. I've  already done that enough. I'm still shocked that he was married. I knew it in the back of my mind, but now that he admitted it, it's different. That was such a long time ago. When he was 20 years old. I was in the seventh or eighth grade. Sometimes you just have to make mistakes and learn from them.   David wants me to call him this weekend while I'm home. I might. I'm not sure about that either. He's a great friend, but he tries to hard sometimes. Of course, I have't told him that I'm seeing any one either. We'll see how that goes.   I'm really worried about my essay for my art history class too. I haven't read any of the book yet. It's a really boring book, but I have to do it. Add it to the list for this weekend.     "
Tell me about yourself.,"     let's see. i love him? maybe. he told me he loved me, well, that he liked falling in love with me. wow. this is new. i love being held by him. i miss him when i'm not with him. i think about him when we're not together. i don't know what to tell him. nothing needs to be said though. we like each other. love may come, develop, whatever. it's a good feeling to know that you are loved, not having family and old friends nearby. he makes me feel like i am at home. now that i do have a new home, up in oklahoma. speaking of which, he said he wanted to come with me when i go up. wonder what the parents will say??? oh well, nich likes him and i know they will too. he's hard not to like. so busy, not enough time. should i stay home this weekend to spend more time with him or is that trying too hard? what's trying to hard though, if my feelings are this strong then it shouldn't matter whether or not i try to be with him. obviously he has the same feelings, he only called me every day like five times in the past couple days since he has been busy with his fraternity business. ahh, the good old fraternities. i wish i would have rushed, but then again i am glad i didn't. there is always next year. wonder if it is more difficult to get in as a sophomore?? we shall see. i mean, i don't think greek life is that important. but aparently to some it is. i guess i need to make more friends that are girls. i really do want to become more involved as well. it's just the whole rushing process that i wouldn't like. the getting all dressed up and basically trying to impress some girls. not to mention the fact it seems like competition. one of my not-so-favorite things. i don't really understand it all. i just couldn't be fake like i know some girls are. why bother? i mean, be who you are if they don't like that, then what on earth are you doing? there's no reason for them not to like me. i can't decide whether it's an acceptance thing or not. i don't think i am scared of being rejected. sure in a sense i am. but i think i would take it better if others didn't have to know. i like the perks with a sorority, they seem fun. a lot of time commitment though. i guess i just think that i would see him more often if i were in a sorority, if not that, then i would be just as busy as he is. i mean, i have lots to do now, probably should be doing even more. but still. it's different. poor erik, i wonder if he is still bitter towards his parents about not letting him pledge. it suprised me when my mom said they would pay for it. does she realize the cost? i know she really wants me to get involved as well though. well, i guess i can just ask casey and lauren and other girls how it is. that is if they can say. blah blah blah. nothing on my mind. oh i wonder if lk got the tickets to the live concert. i want to go. but it's such a hassle to drive to katy and back. plus i would probably miss a few classes. let's see, that friday is my homecoming. haha. won't that be great. very unusual for sure, but it will be fun to see everyone. i wonder if they have changed. i know i have. i mean, i haven't seen these people since may. coming here over the summer was one of the most life-changing experiences. strange enough to say, it is very true. i met so many good friends. i met my baby, who. i love. . yeah about that. we've been   together   for sometime now and he is seeming to settle more or less. which i might add, i thought could never happen. ok, but hold on, we're like 18, no settling allowed. yeah he asked if i would marry him. that was funny, jokingly, luckily. haha. no, funny thought to think about though. marriage. ahh. i really can't wait, no can wait, but i look forward (much better wording) to having a family. i want a happy family and a loving father/ husband. wow, i wonder what guys think about this stuff. i never used to even care about family and husband and future stuff. but since he came along and we've been together. it just makes ya think. good thoughts, nothing too serious. man i love him though. i hope he knows. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     So right now I'm trying to hold myself together. I have so much on my mind that its actually a relief to do this assignment even though its holding my back from a deadline. I recently tryed out for Texas Sirits and shockingly I made the first cut. Wow, out of 300 girls I was one of the eighty to be chosen. THe bad news is that I have to do another   creative   project which equals time and money, two things that are in low supply right now. I hate money. People always say,   money can't by you happiness    but I beg to differ. If you have money then you don't have to worry about finding a place you can afford that isnt 10 miles away from campus, or where you're next meal is comming from. It really is the little things for me though. I would like that extra size ice-cream. or another UT t-shirt. However, Mr. Budget steps in {A good friend of my dads} and prevents me from enjoying the extra   perks   of life. I'm sure I'll look back some day and laugh or maybe this is just one of those challenges in a certain stage of our lives life. Maybe if all the college kids were well off it would disrupt the order of the world. Ramen Noddeles would go out of bussines. Taco Bell would close down. And sadly second hand stores would be no more. Wow i really need to finish my project! Its due in a couple of min. I feel like I'm allways rushing around. My life is one big traffic jam. How is this? maybe I take on too much. But other people take on just as much if not more and they seem in control. I wonder if people think I'm in control? Ha that would be the greatest prank of the decade! OK is ths almost over cause i really got to go. . yes almost.   "
Tell me about yourself.,"Today I got a new washer and dryer. I know this is kind of corny to write about, but I am so excited. I won't have to use the laundry room for the apartment complex anymore, because now  have my own washer and dryer. It cost one dollar to wash and one dollar to dry, in the wash room. My clothes didn't event come out dry. I was so pissed. I am very very thankful for my parents. I would not have this BRANDNEW washer and dryer if it were not for them. God has truly blessed us as a family. My family is a strong, close family. They are always there for me and my sisters no matter what happens. Right now my nieces and nephew ar living with my mom and dad. My sisters are in the Navy,so their children stay with my parents. My mom loves it, but I know it is very hard on her. It is hard on me when I go home to visit. I never get any rest. I am always up around 7:00 in the morning. Someone is always crying at one time or another. Especially Zac, he cries around three in the morning when everyone is asleep. I love going home, but man I get so happy when it is time for me to com back to Austin. This typing thing is going by pretty slow. I swear I have been on here for ten minutes already. I don't even know what else to type about. I could type about my ex-fiance, that would take more than twenty minutes. I am still paying for my foolishness behind him. We were together for a long time, then he proposed. yeah, that same old traditional, only the right way to go kind of things. Anyway, we were together for a long time, about 2 yrs. He proposed in front of my whole family on Dec. 23, which happened to be the day my family celebrated Christmas that yeat. I cried, I said yes . Then all of the drama started, he wanted ot hang out with his friends all of the time , and I just got tired of all of the foolishness. I guess he got tired of all of it too. SO, he broke up with me. I cired for a little while, but my mom helped me out a lot. She told me,   Every woman has her heart broken at least one time, and baby this is your time  . I didn't want to believe it but it was true. I faced the facts, picked up my heart and moved on. It's not time yet!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ghosh the insanity. I guess I will type really slow so time will go by really fast. I never knew twenty minutes would take this long. Time flys by when you're having fun. I guess this is not one of those times. I'm almost there though. I wonder what everyone else wrote about. You know, I feel like I'm talking to myself or some kind of imaginary friend. This seems so funny. Well I guess I'll take these last few minutes to say my goodbyes. I'm just playing, wasn't that funny. No, I didn't think so either. It's only 9:57, I thought it was eleven o'clock. I did that eleven o'clock to waste time. TWO MORE MINUTES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I can almost see the light at the end of the tunnel. It's so delightful. I guess my fingers needed the workout. Poor fingers. Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm what to  do, what to do . 10, 9, 8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,          "
Tell me about yourself.,"Man, i have to do this writing assignment. what a waste of time. i could be sleeping right now. i am so tired. stupid 8:00 classes. i don't want to go to class anymore. that door is really loud. i wonder if the cleaning woman is done cleaning the bathroom. i really have to go. oh well, i can wait 20 minutes. i wonder why 20 minutes is so relative to this assignment. sigh. i can't think of anything to type. pretty blank right now. what's on tv. looks like some big guy doing a hefty exercise. OH MY GOD!  that guy's huge!  picking up kegs. that's strength, right there. i wish is was that strong. that would be really cool. too bad it takes forever to develop that. results would be nice. all that working out at the gym. that's a nice looking road. oh, union pacific. oh, lindsay's responding to my aim. she fell asleep. figures. she's always tired. why am i so bitter about this breakup. i mean we said we were going to be friends. if we're friends then why do i find myself mad at her all the time. i think she doesn't like being around me anymore, despite what she says. girls are so complicating. she could at least be up front about it if she didn't want to hang out anymore. i think this whole ordeal is destroying our chances of getting back together. whatever. i miss her though. or is it her that i really miss?  maybe i just miss having a girlfriend. someone to hold and appreciate. i wonder if. what are you talking about josh. whatever. where was i. oh yeah, girlfriends. world's strongest man. raise your hand, you kow it. raise your hand. damn, this tv's too loud. i can't think. raise your hand. 100 percent. if you're sure. chicken tenders. kick out of dinner tonight. tonight on sports center. what makes realationships so complicated. i see my other friends who are couples and they appear to be fine. steven and katy look like they'rein love with each other. that'll never last. steven't shouldn't be treated like that. and katy needs someone more independent, not a luzy hobo. whatever. at least they have a relationship. man, jeff's got it good. he just picks up girls so easily. people like to be around him. plus he's got erin back home he can go back to for some loving. i miss loving. those were some good days. that's prob why things never worked out with lindsay. she prob wanted something more in the relationship. but what?  i always took her out on dates. . made her feel special. and i slip up one time on my birthday. damnit. why did i have to act that way. i hate when i do that. but one mistake was all it took for thing to go sour. pennebaker?. yeah that's his name. uh. damnit!  i'm so bitter. i really should cool down if i'm ever going to get back in another relationship. who knows how long that'll be. there's a couple girls in band. my gracious!  they are hot!  that would be some sweet loving there i must say. but then there's the guilt of lindsay. there's a neverending trap. what if she still wants back into the relationship?  i know she told sarah that it's a possibility later on this year, but should i really wait for her?  did she really mean that much to me?  of course she did, or i would've broke up with her a long time ago. but why do i feel differently now?  what makes now so different than the past. i guess things get old over time, and changes must be made. looks like i took the first step by breaking up. i guess i should just move on. we'll see. oh, time's up. oh but i can still write. hmm. well i guess i'm done. i want to sleep before band practice anyway. man, why do we have to go off campus. they make things so difficult. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Wow. I reall don't like the color scheme of this page. It looks kind of gay. Oh well. hmmm, I better not diss the webpage, I might get a bad grade.

"
Tell me about yourself.,"     So, I'm supposed to be wtiting something. hmmm, looks like blank for now. that lady at the library help desk is really talking fast, or maybe i'm. i can't believe my sister didn't call me back, we were supposed to go grocery shopping. i keep hitting the back slash butten and then i have to stop and delete it. la dee da. biology note. now that woman can talk fast. she's just out of school too. and she has a good job. hope i can find a good job once i get out of school, of course that first means that i have to get out of school . when ever that is. nice pants. actually never, i don't really like heather grey. my mom always says that makes me look washed out. whatever that means. blank. another blank. i hope that the timer on this computer doesn't go out berfore the writing assignment timer goes out. writing assignment. library online. i have so much work to do. . wendy's that's sounds goood. i;m wearing a lot of blue. i always wear a lot of blue. . blue pen, blue spiral, blue notepad, blue mouse pad, even the E for internet explorer is blue. too much blue. hmmmmmmmm. keep writing don't stop. this will be jam packed. oh yeah. i wonder what tthis is for too. oops mispelled this. should i go back and change it. ha ha , when i type i saay everything so slowly. at least i haven't mispelled more words. finally got my bracelet back. Ben. that was wierd seeing him again. what was even more wierd was seeing him wearing my bracelet. jerk off. oh, i wonder if it ws okay for me to   say   jerk off in this writing assignment, oh well, too late. finish button. can't wait to click on you. i crack my knuckles a lot. i hope i don't get arthritis. that would be a nice addition to the collection of future annoyances. hey that guy ws kind of cute. never mind! he turned around. mark is cute. yes he is. i wish he would call me back, but he's busy at work. raaaaaaaarrrrr. wait a second. has it been twenty minutes. am i supposed to keep track of the twenty minutes or does the computer automatically cut you off after twenty minutes? it's got to have been more than 15 minutes. at  least. i wonder why he said   set the right key    set the right key to what?  right, right.    "
Tell me about yourself.,"     So this is my first writing assignent for college. I keep forgetting that I am actually in school, and not on vacation of some sort. I just got out of bad and am havign a lot of feelings right now, all about non-important things, like boys. I am mad I lost my earing last night, mad that i still have feelings for my ex-boyfriend in a way, and mad that I don't know what to do about people here. It is just a totally different experience then anything else and I wonder when I will get used to it. I think i also need to learn how to type better and use punctuation! IMs never need punctuation or capitilization. or even correct spelling. Roommate is still gone, staying with her boyfriend, and its ok because i like him better now. Before I thought he was boring adn not as nice as David, but he is quite goofy and is always nice to em, though soemtimes I get the feeling its because he feels that I am a dork who just goes wherever Jerry goes. People kept telling us that rooming together would be a problem, but so far we have only had issues once, right before school started when we were spending way too much time together, and that was not good. That one night she left to stay at Steven's and walked out saying, have fun, made me want to punch her, because obviously I was just going ot be hanging out in the room, alone. Now that I am meeting people on my own out of   the group  , its much easier to do things and feel like I have a life. I still need to meet more people in my hall, and in classes, but most of them are so big that just being there I feel like not really participating. Going to the lake on labor day was quite an adventure, and one I am glad I had without Jerry. and jumping off the cliff was one of the coolest things i have done in a while. It also made me glad that no other girls went off the 50 foot cliff. I like doing things that girls normally don't do in these group situations, like the firebreathing and the shotgunning a beer. . but having done it once, I don't need to do that again. but I stil almost beat that guy when we did it, hehe. I don't understand why people drink beer- it tastes horrible and I have heard that after about 2, you don't taste it anymore. . but that means you have to drink 2 of them and then you must be getting pretty mindless to keep drinking somthing you don't like in the first place. Then it seems more like somthing people do to be   cool  , or whatever else people think they need to do. I have seen less of that in college. people seem more laid back in general about all sorts of things, but then again, there are still sorority girl types out there. I can't get over my dislike of the idea of sororities, probably because I don't know many girls well who are in them. I have been mostly meeting the guys in Steven's fraternity, and they are all nice, and not all mindless drinkers (mostly c. s. majors or engineers) and I am gald that i got to meet them all. . but they are all older then me. I used to love to tell people how young I actually was because they were always shocked, saying things like,   oh, you don't look/ act   however old I was at the time. My birthday was just over 2 weeks ago, and that sort of blows my mind because of all the things that have happened so far. Its like every phase of my life is separate from everything else that has happened in my life. its hard to even think of middle school anymore, and even freshman year of high school seems like someone elses life. Its also hard to belive that everything with Jason just happened last month, that we broke up in August and now its just September, barely, but it still feels like forever since it happened. OH CRAP. the phone just rang and it was some one asking me to go to the co-op with her- yeah! no more looser-dom! But then somehow I hit somthing that made the site go away and now that I'm back ,the timer has started all over again. Well, I think I have about 10 more minutes. So, all I have accomplished today was sleeping until noon, which has to be my sleep limit, I NEVER used to do that. and now I guess I will go to the co-op to return a book and hang out with Yashoda, and then. I guess I have to get ready for my   date  , I guess thats what it is. I am not looking forward to it anymore after last night, I don't know were we are going or even if I want to go anymore. So yesterday Jerry was telling me about her comparitive values seminar, and how they had to come to class with somthing to share that they were   absolutely certain   about, somthing not-ohysical that they could prove. jerry said that   I am me  , and that seems certain enough to me. . but another girl said that she is a woman, and they just picked that apart in class because really, how can you be certain of that? I think the point of that class is to weird you out and show you that nothing is certain. . so as if you werent already clueless enough at this point in your life, now you have some class where they tell you nothing is for sure. Besides physical things, what makes me a woman? The way I act? Why do I act the way I do? Those questions could go on forever with no answer, but it really made me think about the whole gender thing. Possibly I am a gay man trapped in a woman's body? Oh, the lady in the cafeteria-place today called me   sir  . I can't believe that happened, she said she couldnt see me around the sign or sneeze guard or whatever was there in front of her but. she called me sir! Brings back not-good thoughts of Jordan thinking it was funny to call me   butch   and Dawn telling me that I am   just one of the guys  . yah, maybe some gender issues here. I am a woman! Even if its not totally certain according to all this deep philosophy stuff, I AM a woman, and I happen to like boys, and I am pretty sure I don't resemble a guy (even with my upper-body buff-ness from swim team) but it is still a sore topic for me. It doesnt help that I am tall. oh! another phone call. I think my time should be up but the timer is all off, so I will say that this is 20 minutes and that is that! "
Tell me about yourself.,"Before i came to University of Texas, I have always thought that i wanted to be a doctor. I did not know any requirements of getting into medical school. But after I came to University, I started to hear all hardships that make people give up on medical school. My major is biology. I thought that I have to have biology major to be a pre-med, yet it is not true. I can have any kind of major as long as i take all classes that are required for medical school. I want to get high GPA this semester or this year so that i can change my major to biomedical engineering. If i have that major, i would not have to worry about not getting into medical school, for they have other kinds of job even though you don't get into medical school.   Actually, if i keep my major, i do not have to worry about taking extra classes, because i need to take a lot of biology and chemistry classes to get into medical school. If i have different major than biology, i have to take more classes to get into medical school and get my degree of that major.   I think that I always have dilemma in my life, as i am experiencing right now. Even for little things like choosing between going home or staying at school.  For example, I want to go home this weekend, yet I am going to be too tired to work anything on Sunday for preparing for classes, if i go home. On the other hand, if I don't go home this weekend, i will not be able to go until all the exams are finished, which is beginning of the October.   My parents and I were separated for more than 2 years while i was in highschool in America. April of this year, finally my parents came to America to live with me. But I came to University, so we are separated again. I miss my parents very much.   Sometimes I think it is good to be separated from parents, and live by myself. It made me more a mature and independent person. It is the first step of getting in a big society as adult.   In here, no one tells me to what to do. But sometimes that makes me feel more scary. I need to manage my schedule wise and control everything that happens to me. I don't have any person to depend on besides a few friends. Friends are helpful and cheerful to me, yet i can not find same comfort from them as I used to find from my family.   I hope that I work hard everyday no matter what kind of situation I have so that i can achieve my goal that is to go to medical school and be a doctor. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     I was so excited about coming to UT and I still am but alot of things just over whelm me. For example, people in Austin are not a friendly as college students at other schools. Basically im talking about the girls its all about what frat your in and bullshit like that. I am always so nervous about screwing up in class like for example Psychology I am always worried that im gunna forget to do something and I am always worried that im not taking the right notes. What it really comes down to is that im always worried about grades and wether my parents are gunna accept my grades. I always woder wether they would really take me out of school but im not gunna ever see because i won't let my self be that bad of a student. I worry alot way to much i just wish sometimes i could just say F*** it and do my own thing but i know if i do that then i will fall behind and never be able to catch up. I think one of the real reasons that im always worried is because im dislexic and i feel that sometimes that holds me back from being a great student. I nother thing that bothers me are bad room mates like my room mate now he has a 4. 0 in buisness honors and basically i thinks that he is right on everything. That really pisses me off because he has no common since and living with him has not been the best thing because i can already tell that his parents have done everything for him because he never cleans up after himself and he is always trying to blaim me for plates and food that gets left out and it is always him. I know that sounds stupid but i don't forget to put food back in the frig because i love to eat so food is important to me and i would not for get it. One thing that i don't like about living in Austin is that it is so expensive to live here. Every place on campus is between 700 and 900 dollars a month not including the electric bill, gas bill or telephone bill. I really wish the weather would get better it is so hot right now that walking to class has been killing me, i hate to sweat and i swear thati walk into class looking like i just got out of the pool. One more thing that is really bothering me is my ex-girl friend like we were only together for all of july and august and i broke up with her because she goes to tcu and i got to ut and i would not work out. But i always find myself wanting to call her and she always calls me but everytime we end up getting in a fight and and we never ever faught when we were together. I wish life was easier because if she went to school here i would not ever have a problem except for guys trying to talk to her. That is one of my biggest flaw with her is that she is so hot and guys are always trying to hit on her right in front of me and she always tells them that she has a boyfriend but i always wonder if she says that when im not around i really worried about that this summer. And now she calls asking about girls and weather i was dating someone and i really think that she is one of the perfect girls that changes in different scenes. For example, in Dallas she is the best beautiful and kind and the best personality but everytime i went with her to TCU i felt like i was with a different person and that really bothers me because i hate fake people. My goal is to find a girl that never lies and i will be happy for the rest of my life with that girl. I can't wait for that day that i get a great job and find the women of my dreams. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     I am sitting hear at my desk in the dorm listening to Ashley in the kitchen. I   hear the cabinets shutting and bowls that are clanging together. I wonder what   she is eating for lunch It kind of makes me hungry too. Now I'm thinking about   when I'm going to eat . I have my discussion class in another 40  minutes across   the street. I'm worried that I won't make it to the psych SI meeting afterwards   because there are so many things to do. I told Katy and Jenina that I would go with   them, but I really want to go by the party on the plaza to see all the clubs and   organizations. I'm not sure why I want to go by there. There are so many different   organizations that I want to do and I am feeling so stressed out right now with all   the options racing through my head, but i don't want to overcommit because then   what if I can't handle the coursework and my grades drop. That also worries me. I   have three tests coming up next week at least in my huge intro classes. I am so   confused as to what they will be over and how closely I should be reading and   what I need to pick up on. That is why I really need to go to the SI meeting today.  Hopefully that will help. So now I am thinking back to what organizations I want to   join. I am already feeling so overwhelmed with having to squeeze in 10 study   hours a week for Kappa Delta. I don't think that much time is unreasonable, but it's   just that I have to walk to the house and that takes time and then I might run out of   reading to do and just end up sitting there. If it weren't for the rowing team, I would   be able to spend plenty of time there, but it just so happens that I row in the   afternoon, so I can't really get anything done for a solid length of time. That   sidekicks meeting was fun last night, but I really don't think I can go to the party   tonight because I need to sleep. I always falll asleep in that RTF class at 8 am and   I need to be alert. Oh, and I have that spanish composition that I need to learn   vocab and the verb forms for. There is so much to do and I'm worried that I just   can't do rowing because  it takes so much time, but maybe I'd rather be playing a   sport then watching it liek the sidekicks organiztion. I just don't know. I also want to   play volleyball, but I can't decide what level to play on. My FIG is starting a team,   but will that be frustrating because we won't be good and I want to play   competetively or will it be relaxing and fun. I can't decide!  I really want someone to   tell me what will work best because I just want to enjoy college. Ashley just flushed   the toilet so that water is running. I wonder what is wrong with her. She's been so   upset the last few days and it's weird that she doesn't stay here some nights. I think   it's boyfriend problems, but she won't say. And I think it's weird that Tim was over   here when I walked in last night. If I were Diana I think that would weird me out, but   I guess I shouldn't worry about that. He seems nice though.  I miss everyone so   much. I love Anna and my KD girls, but life just isn't the same. I don't want to be   home, but I want all my friends to be here with me. No one understands me liike   they do and I miss all the closeness that we had together. I especially wish jennifer   and Becky were here. I need to be harassed by Becky in her caring funny way   and I need Jen's crazy overexcited   guess what   every now and then. I hope   Ashley is doing well. She's probably in London right now. The T. V. is on in the   next room and I hear a motorcycle outside. I hate those things so much. They are   so dangerous. I can't decide what to do tonight. I want to go out and meet guys, but   I really shouldn't. I hope that Paul guy doesn't call this weekend. He's the biggest   player. Oh I wonder if I have OU tickets yet. I can't believe they're only giving out   2,000. I really need to get to class. I feel guilty after all the september 11th stuff   yesterday and not going to the candlelight ceremony, but I just get so depressed   after seeing it over and over and then not being with the same people I was at this   time last year makes me sad. I miss everyone so much, but now I need to go to   class. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     I really like music, i think its really cool to just get on the computer and be able to listen to any song, at anytime. it really bothers me when you turn on the radio and they are all on a commercial at the same time. It's very aggrivating, but this world is run by money so I guess there is not much we can do about it. When i listen to music, I like to day dream and imgaine that there is a story to every song, which usually there is, but I parallel the stories to my life and see how they impact me. I also just like to fantasize about certain things that a song might talk about that are a little far fetched. Music helps me go to sleep also. I can never really fall asleep to it, but I will catch myself doozing off and then wake up and turn off the songs. Speaking of sleeping, why is it that you never really remember the good dreams but the nightmares and the ones that are just really weird. I've also thought its really weird that you ususally forget your dreams if you don't write them down as soon as you have them. Why is that? Usually my nightmares involve harm coming to my family but no matter how bad they get, I also manage to either transport or take my family to safety just in time. I still wake up in a cold sweat but just the fact that I know they are ok, makes me feel better. Even if I keep going back to the same part of the dream I try my best to get them out of danger. I have a very strong family background. When I was in high school my friends used to make fun of me saying i had the perfect  family and that nothing could ever go wrong. I always thought it was weird that even though i had a strong family background most of my friends didn't. Their parents were either divorced or had really bad problems. One of my friends got kicked out of her house, well she left actually but she had gotten in a really bad fight with her mother and her mom had called her a slut. I don't think I could handle my mother calling me a name like that. I think I have a very good relationship with my mother but I know that I don't tell her everything that goes on in my life. I've noticed that I have most of my secrets spread out through a bunch of people, like no one person knows all of my secrets. I guess that is because I'm afraid to trust one person so much, but I don't think that is a bad thing. I just think that I'm afraid that if one person knows me totally they will turn on me and tell everyone my personal business. I guess that is because in junior high I had a group of friends that turned on me and I don't think I ever forgave them. I went my own way in high school but to this day I still think of their betrayel and I can still feel the pain from it. Even though I haven't always had the best friends in the world, if I have a falling out with a friend I usually will make up with them later on in life. We might not be friends again but the air will be cleared and we can be civil to each other. That also works for my ex-boyfriends, it seems like after about a year we will begin to talk again and everything is ok. I've always been able to make friends with guys better than I have with girls, I really do not think I'm that much of a tomboy but I just think they are easier to get along with and cause less drama. My first year in college was the first time I think I made more girl friends but that also might be because I'm in nursing and there is a serious shortage of men in that field. I don't mind girls I just think they have more issues than guys. I also think it's really weird that I haven't found that one single person yet either. Everyone says that in college is when you find your husband and - or wife, but I think I'll just let it happen when it happens. Like even if I like one guy, there is almost always another one. I think I like like four guys right now and its terrible. One has a girlfriend, but is going to dump her in a little bit, apparently she is being a bitch. He doesn't know I like him but his friends do, it's crazy. I think I've been boy crazy all my life, seriously. If a hot guy walks by I just turn to mush. I think the ideal guy would be about my height, not too tall or short, with dark hair and either green or blue eyes. He would have to be tan of course and have the best sense of humor either. He would also have to be a talker, I'm really into having good conversations. Don't get me wrong there is always time for silence or just having fun but every relationship I've been in has failed because of some communication issue and I think I've just learned that as long as you keep the communication channels open things will be good. I think I am a good communicator fo. r the most part, I know I'm a good peace maker and keeper, coming from a family where I had two sisters and one brother I guess its no surprize. I've noticed that people like to tell me about their problems also. I can just be sitting somewhere and someone will start talking to me and telling me their life story and I think it's just because they want someone to listen and that's exactly what I do. Not everyone wants advice, sometimes they just want to be heard. I've noticed that people in the hospital like to talk to anyone who walks in the door. I work at childrens and parents will also be eager and willing to talk to me. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now, I am trying to figure out how I can sign up to volunteer at the Metz Elementary reading program because I cannot get in touch with the coordinator. Anyway, I think that something must have happened to her because she has not responded to me. Now I am wooried about where I am going to volunteer and get my hours by the due date. I am watching TV and thinking about the studying that I have to do for my classes. I am trying to find a way to feel involved in this university and make my mom think that I am doing okay so that she will not worry. I am worried about my mom, sisters, and brother because I miss them terribly. I do not want to wish away the time that I have here but I think that I am feeling like there is nothing familiar around me that I can recognize. I feel a lot more calm these days, and I think that since the long session has started I feel a lot more useful and busy. Mostly, I am worried about making good friends because I feel like the friends that I left are still my real friends and that I am on some sort of vacation. I want to have a good future at this University with good classes and good friends but I think that I am doubting my ability to succeed. I wish that I could bring the people that I care about around me every once and a while because I did not realize that they were part of the strength that I had to live my life. I think about my grandmothers a lot lately, what they would have said about me being in college, and how they would have wanted me to enjoy myself and not to worry. I think that I am in a constant state of speeding up and slowing down because I do not want to get too excited about something because I may become dissapointed or upset. I think about potential disasters that could occur in my life and am always second guessing the decisions that I make. How can I be the best person that I can be without scaring myself into anxiety. I wonder about all of my friends, and what they feel like, and how they are doing and if they feel the same way. I worry that I will not feel as secure as I did at home in this big place, but I know that if I just give it time, I will feel like I belong. I am constantly aware that God is in control of my life and that I need to learn what God is trying to teach me and lean not on my own understanding of my life. I worry that I sleep to much, but I do not feel tired in the daytime, however I guess that it is necessary to get enough rest. Mostly, I feel void of emotion because I miss my mom so much. I do not feel that I took her for granted when I lived in her house but I miss seeing her persistance, and love and support. I am learning to be my own support. I wonder if she is as lonely without me as I am without her. It was a comfort to be in the house with her at the end because she was feeling much calmer and in control of ther life. I am excited to be here, and I want to count the blessings that I have because of the many people that want to be here. I want to learn to depend on myself, and not feel like the things that I want are not right for me because I am trying to learn that what I want is right for myself. Oftem throughout the day I doubt the things that I do or the feeings that I have,  "
Tell me about yourself.,"     yeah so i really don't want to be doing this but oh well. i really actually enjoy the psych class though sometimes i wonder how exactly anyone can figure out what a person is thinking. who came up with those experiments in the first place. im so relaxed right now cause i just got back from having a one hour massage. it was kind of weird at first cause i had never had one before but after like 10 min i was asleep. i so needed a massage, and i always seem to be tired even though i feel i get plenty of sleep. i don't think im typing as fast as i should be because there is this little voice saying you mispelled a word, go back and correct it. i guess that means i don't know if im actually completing the exercise correctly. but he never did list whether things had to be grammarically correct. i feel that im like this never ending jutebox that won't stop talking. right now im typing like those really annoying people that you never want to listen to that you are just like SHUT UP. haha. yeah so i have alot of stuff on my mind lately. i would like to actually call this my vent session because i have all this stuff in my mind thats just really been bugging me and i can't tell anyone because my best friend is so far up my roommates butt, because they are boyfriend and girlfriend, that i can say how i REALLY feel. my roommate can be such a jerk sometimes. and he does the stupidest things that just totally piss me off. like this one time i got back home from houston and he was like its your turn to buy the groceries. but i was the one that bought eighty-eight dollars in food when he only bought thirty. he was like well I've finally caught up with you now and I've spent one hundred and eighty. and im thinking, well jeez im sorry to put you out but i barely ever eat. i swear he eats like there is no tomorrow and i think that I've narrowed it down to how many times he eats a day. like 5!  it just really pisses me off. and he tells ME how i do nothing. im not the one who has tuesday and thursday off. not only that he sleep all freakin day. hes SO LAZY. i just want to say to him, hey im not the one that spends 50 freakin dollars on the lunch meat you pick out and watch them cut. come on and give me a freakin break. on top of the whole grocery issue, my parents have ME on a strict budget and so i can't spend all that much money. he goes out and buys a three hundred dollar tv because he feels like it. what can you say to that. his dad is working his butt off to pay for all the crap my roommate uses. dang the phone is ringing now and i can't concentrate anymore on what i was saying. anyways. yeah so i just want to be like, why don't you get off your lazy, pardon my language ass, and get a freakin job and stop mooching off of all your daddy's money. its not like his parents are rich either, he just thinks he is. on top of that he is sooo vain. everything on him and around him is so perfect. sometimes i wonder if hes a girl at heart or if he just LOVES looking at himself in the mirror.   god if only i was brave enough to tell him how i really feel. it wouldn't be so bad except for the fact is that its my freaking apartment too and my best friend, though i love her to death, is living with us. its like nightmare that never ends. you know those feelings when you are a third wheel and you just want to get the hell out? can you imagine it like 24/7. its horrible. it just makes you want to crawl in a hole and die. come on i pay for the freaking apartment the least she could do is STOP mooching off of us and possibly go home?  jeez.  on the topic of being a third wheel. i have this issue with two guys. im seeing this guy in houston that i like alot since my last boyfriend who totally broke my heart. lets say the guy im dating now is bob, and my ex is paul. so bob is like so sweet and hes alot older than me and i miss him a whole lot. at the same time paul who NOW goes to school with me, the reason we broke up is a long story, well we are becoming good friends. i never expected the thing with bob to actually happen over the summer and so now i have this like guy who i don't know exactly what we are but is considered a long distance relationship. bob has been nothing but sweet to me and i love him,  actually wait another thing he doesn't want me to tell him that i love him either. i mean maybe i do and maybe i don't. so yeah, me and paul have become best friends again after our whole breakup and his cheating on me with the girlfriend he had, but then calling me to tell me two weeks before school started back up that he had broken up with her. come on now, i haven't talken to paul in like forever then he calls me to tell me hes broken up with his girl friend. strange yes. but I've told myself that I've gotten over with him after being his girlfriend for two and half years. thats a long time to spend on one person. so yeah he came over yesterday to hang out with me while i was waiting for the time warner roadrunner dudes to come over and me and paul started watching a movie together. he started getting closer and closer to me but i was like woah arent we just friends. so i get up to get a drink, come back to my room and lay down on my bed. paul sits on my back and starts giving me a   friendly back massage   and all the while i was thinking that i really miss him and that i wouldn't mind getting back together with him. at this time bob hadn't called me since sunday night and i was getting really worried. so i started relaxing and having a good ole time with paul. later that night bob calls and hes like hey sweetie, i miss you and im sorry i haven't called you but I've been really busy and i tried sending you and email but it didn't work. yeah so now im caught in this situation that i can't seem to get out of or fig ure out. should i go after my ex that is here in austin. or should i go after bob whose been nothing but sweet to me, but is back home. i don't know what  i should do. and on top of all of this im sorta lonely, and i have alot of school work to take care and if i WANT a social life that not only that i can't seem to find ,and i have to work. i think that im slowly going insaine and this is too much things to think about for a person at my age. woah so yeah im going to stop now cause I've actually typed past the twenty min but i kind of feel better though "
Tell me about yourself.,"     Well i just got back from Houston, where i live. It was weird going back. Kind of like this isn't my home anymore, even though Austin isn't my home. It's just my temporary home. It's weird though seeing my parents, knowing that I won't see them for a long time. It was good to see them again. I hope I'm not going to make myself too crazy up here with school. School is my number one priority. I want to have a good life after this, i don't want to end up in a job i hate. Hopefully i figure out what i want to do with my life. I don't know if i want to teach, or work for a record label, or write for the rest of my life, or do something with crime scene investigation. I think being a criminal psycologist would be a lot of fun. I bet it would never get boring! I just hope I'm not getting in over my head with this class. I've always been interested in psycology, and how people act and why, and what causes it, but I'm afraid i will be over my head. Hopefully not. It seems like it will be very intersting despite the hard work I know will come. It's very strange being in a class that's so huge! I'm used to being in classes with no more than 30 people. I guess all freshmen are though. I still feel like I'm kind of out of place sometimes here. Luckily I've been making friends with the people on my floor. Everyone here seems really cool. There are a few girls down the hall that are soo cool! I could see myself being friends with them for awhile. I hope so at least! Everyone here seems very nice and friendly. (At least the people on my half of the floor does. ) The other side seems very anti-social. We all have our doors open on this side of the floor, but I never see any of their doors open down the hall. It's strange, but i don't really miss many of my friends. I don't think this makes me a bad friend, I just think i was ready to separate from them. Some of them at least. But I thought I was going to miss some of them SO much, but in reality, I don't miss many of them. Especially some of the friends I was supposedly   best friends   with. I sometimes wonder if I'm missed. I wonder if I was as good of a friend as i thought I was. I don't know. One of the girls down the floor just got back frlom out of town. She's one of the girls i think i could be good friends with for awhile after this year. She's a lot like me! Surprisingly. It's hard to find people who don't really drink, and have more fun just hanging out, and going bowling, or going to the movies, instead of going to a frat, or a big party. It's cool though that she's like that. It's nice to find someone who likes the same things you do, especially when they're so uncommon around college kids! I've only been back for a few hours, and I don't miss my parents! I thought i would miss them more. I think this means I'm grown up now! haha, grown up. That's weird to think. I don't feel like I'm grown up. I still feel like the same old nerd from Houston. haha. I finally threw my flowers out that were sent to me, and washed the vase. They were starting to smell a little funky. Danielle, my roommate just got back from the grocery store. I hope she bought good food! hehe. The food here is pretty good though, surprisingly. Not like home, but good enough to eat. Some of it is really good though, you just have to pick the right things is all. I could talk about food all day! haha. I can't wait to watch Sex and the City tonight with some girs from the floor. Since we don't get HBO here my mom taped the last 2 episodes and I brought them abck for all of us poor girls with no HBO! Hopefully Emily gets back from dropping her boyfriend off at SW in not too long. I have an early class in the morning, and i don't want to miss it. Especially since it's a class of 14 people, it would be hard to go unnoticed. I think it will be a fun class. It's Jazz and Literature. I love listening to jazz, but there's going to be a lot of writing and reading. Hopefully the writing will be fun. I love creative writing and writing like this, just writing whatever comes to my head. But essays and stuff aren't that fun. I don't know anyone who likes writing them though. My rhetoric class is going to be a lot of that not fun writing though. Yuck. Oh well it's a class I have to take. Hopefully I'll enjoy it though. Otherwise it's going to be hard to drag myself to the class every Tuesday and Thursday. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     I wish travis would stop switching channels on the TV. actually i wish my internet was hooked up already. then i wouldn't have to be over here in his getto room. granted he is like my best friend from elementary that boy needs some help. or maybe its just because he is a boy. i have a few other friends that are guys that have issues with cleaning their rooms. but for the most part by this time in thier life i would expect them to be able to clean up after themselvesm. maybe my expectations are too high. i know they can be to high for my self sometimes but if they werent then i wouldnt' be here at UT. i would have just stayed at home and gone to community college. So in that respect i am glad to have standards that are maybe too high. it keeps me interested in whats going on. ok so travis is talking to the tv, now i know for him this is normal but still it seems odd to me. For a 19 year old i wouldn't expect him to be watching nick jr at 10 in the morning. i mean he was the validictorian of my class shouldn't he be studying or watching something educational or at least more mature?  i dunno. i think he is going to the game with me and some of my friends. im a little concerned with how they are going to treat him. he doesn't come off as the straightest guy you've ever met. infact he doesn't come of as straight at all. although he claims he only likes gals. i don't really believe him and im kind of just waiting for him to come out. in high school he was the only male cheerleader in the history of the school and its a small school. he wasn't good at it either but the school couldnt' say no to him because they thought he might sue if they didn't let him in. so they did. but then when he wasn't allowed to dance with the female cheerleaders he threw a fit which really didn't go to his straightness accredation. but i know one day he will just be like   kendra im gay   and i'll be like   i know its about time    and then life will continue just as it always has. ha reading rainbow is on. i haven't watched that show in forever. i didn't even know it was still showing. i knew mr. rogers retired. i grew up on that show. i grew up on all of PBS. i was really big into it and my younger brother just wasn't so when he was old enough to say what he wanted to watch it was something like power rangers or ninja turtles. he would throw a fit if i was watching pbs. he didnt' learn to read as fast either. im sure their is a correlation but i think its mostly because i was an only child when i was learning to read and my brother always had me getting in the way of his   alone time   with mom. but luckily for him he gets all the alone time with her that he can handle and he's in high school too. i think its just too funny. now mom's retired and always home and while i used to be jealous of the time they spent together -her always helping with his homework she would always go to his class parties and such - now she follows him around just so she won't get bored. i mean i know how often she calls me just to make sure i've been locking the doors before i go to sleep. i almost feel bad for him. almost. except he gets more parental funding still being at home and never having a job. i never asked for money like he does. i can't understand where his money goes either. he doesn't go anywhere he can't drive. but still he has no money. other than food i don't know where it goes i think he just puts it in a shoe box until he can afford a video "
Tell me about yourself.,"     why am i nervous about this assignment, it can't be wrong, i feel like i'm writing so randomly, i'm usually so structured, or am i , i really haven't been lately, i'm so lazy sometimes, like today i didn't want to go to physics class and i just didn't wake up, i think i turned my alarm off, but i'm not 100% sure, i really don't like early early classes, it's such a bum to get up for them, on and on and on, and even if they don't go on like that, it's just such a pain having to get up for them, i mean it's so blessed early, 8:30 in the blamin morning, i mean come on, who wants to be studying physics at that time of morning, it's way to early, way too early, and u'd think that with all the money the university has, it could  get some professors who speak good english, not that they don't know what they're talking about or anything like that, it just seems a little out of place, that's all, this place sure is a mixing pot, names i've never seen before and many i'll bever be able to pronounce, so many people, so many names, just going down the hall and meeting some random person and talking for hours, and bam! u have a friend, or two, or 5 as the case may be, i mean sheesh, this is the place to be, there's just so much to do that u never feel like doing your homework, except this assignment, i actually like this one, it has purposed guised beneath it's apparent randomidity, i really should reconsider my major, i can't stand to get up for calculus, i dread physics and i loath chemistry, but when it comes to things like psychology, government, history, english, i can't wait to get to class, i don't despise having to get to know enough to pass the blamin test, i teach it to others, spend spare time to find the little intricate details that so intrigue my intellect, the adjectives and grammatical spurts that titilate the mind as opposed to the numbers and inferences that wear on one's nerves like grating concrete on your skull, one's a vacation and one's imprisonment, i really should get more sleep, i'm having trouble typing straight, or maybe it's just the rediculously small amount of space i have to write on this little desk with my frankenstein computer, how am i going to afford my chem book,no, not chem, my philosophy book, whoops, great one to put on here, they now think i'm horrible, no i really love psych, i even had it in high school, just haven't gotten the book yet, have to go to the financial aid office to get my mess straightened out, then got to do my blinkin physics homework tonight, jeez, and i've got to get the stupid dart transit thing worked out, they really need more hours in the day or some thing like that, everyone wants money and almost noone will come to dinner, people say they'll call and never do, people say they'll stop by and never do, do i need a message board? will anyone actually use it, or will people erase it if they do? am i paranoid? it's possible, in most cases i'm just prepared and my wrists are getting a little tired from typing in this awkward position, that is with this numbskull desk here, i'll probably get carpal tunnell or something, see even my spelling's going, that's what too much math will do to a person, i honestly don't understand this new calculus course i'm in, since when do mathemeticians make INFERENCES, in these problems we're having to make a whole string of INFERENCES to come a concrete answer? i think not! math is supposed to be about numbers and certainties and the correct technical notation which my TA and professor seem to think is unneccessary, IT IS NECESSARY, i mean come on here, u can't just start putting stuff down and have it be correct, if u don't define it right it could mean anything, i've seen sounder arguments made against abortion in philosophy class than i've seen arguments made for what some limit or sequence is, i thought math was supposed to be the one infallible, untouchable truth because it relied on cold hard unchangeable numbers, but NO, i'm in stinking cal 2 and i've hardly seen a solid number yet, most of what i've seen is shifty half arguments that if used in a court case would set a criminal off scott free, and they claim it to be the language of the universe? if that's so then it's just a confusing and complex a language as english because there's always some exception, some little thing that messes you up, some minor, minute, miniscule tidbit that u miss that makes the entire thing false, give me a break people, and as if it were easy to pay attention in class anyway, with the shorts and shirts the fine UT woment wear, it's a wonder any studying gets done at all, and in the one class i do have a relatively subdued female population, i have a professor that seems like everybody's grandpa and does nothing but write formulas on the board and make side comments about important rules that are already supposed to be common knowledge, NO they are not common knowledge, maybe to u, but u already HAVE your stinkin PhD, we haven't even gotten a bachelor's yet, so stop your assuming, jeez i'm thirsty, u'd think i'd been yelling all this at someone for the past 20 minutes for as dry as my mouth is, in all honesty if someone took the time they could probably findout who wrote this if they really wanted to, it's not like i haven't given enough clues already, well i'm just in the hope and confidence that they won't, oh look, time's almost up, well that was a productive venting section, now if we could only fix all of these problems, oh well, life is life and that's the way it goes, we'll just have to deal "
Tell me about yourself.,"     I suppose I should go to the Student Health center tomorrow to see about this stupid blocked up ear of mine. I walked in there today, but it looked like there was a division for international students or something, and I, as usual, didn't bother to ask around. I'll just give them a call or something to verify before I trek over there next. I wonder if Rick checked in at Target for that television shelf mom saw. I'd like to go check for it and hang around with him this weekend, but I may be going back to Houston. It'll be good to see mom, dad, and Anna again. It's great up here, but it's obviously considerably different than it would be staying in the bed I've slept in for eighteen years. It's funny how that sort of thing works. Something so simple as a bed or a rug that has always seemed inconsequential can suddenly seem important once it's gone, though I suppose that's the way it goes regarding most things. Taking things for granted is much easier for most people. I really wish this bloody ear would unclog itself (bloody being the British exclamation, mind you. I have a tendency to drop into foreign exclamations some times, and I'm sure a writing assignment such as this wouldn't be particularly indicative of the situation surrounding the term. Yeesh, I rant quite a lot). I'm sure that last sentence is probably improperly punctuated, but I'm going to let it slide this time. Anyway, now I'm coming to the problem I expected would happen. I have nothing of real substance to put into the paper, though in essence that in itself is enough to fuel the writing. This is a stream of consciousness, after all, and noticing that being unable to come up with anything to type is just as fulfilling (and even as clich)as any other topic. Huh. I seemed to have remember the alt command to activate the accented 'e'. Ahh, the little oddities one remembers from the subconscious. I find it incredibly amusing that I am typing this as though I were talking to someone as opposed to writing my traditionally lengthy essays. English class has taught me well, it would seem. Okay, I love this Coleman fold out chair and all, but the positioning at my desk is somewhat irritating. It's just a bit too low, so I have to set my ketboard in my lap to type, and the annoyance is exacerbated by the fact that my arms are bent when typing. It's uncomfortable, but not so much that I cannot type. I am going to arbitrarily place another paragraph now. This one has run on for far too long with out a break, irregardless of the fact that it is nothing but constantly flowing ideas.          There, much better, even though I momentarily forgot that tab changes the command field in Internet Explorer. I had to space over to start. Oh well, this is better now anyway. It's sort of a strange quirk I have that originated from my junior English class. Mrs. Eppich managed to ingrain certain formats into me, though that is not necessarily a bad thing. Hmm, scalp is itching. I think I want to go to the gym in the basement tonight. I haven't been in awhile, and since my ankle is better now, it will make things much more productive that my last excursion. And my computer just skipped on my Nightwish CD. That is annoying, though I supppose it's to be expectedf given the fact that I've got a few programs running. Five hundred and twelve megs of memory can only support so many applications. Listening to this music is great, though. There are so few metal bands with lead singers worth a shite (yes, there's another term from the British Isles I like to incorporate)despite the fact that many of them have very talented instrumentalists. Most symphonic metal bands have superb synth and guitar parts, but I have a grudge against bad vocalists. That's why I like Tarja so much. I mean, you can't go wrong with an operatic soprano and good instrumentals. Hansi Krsch is also good. Never before have I heard a growling voice with as much musicality to it. Okay, I took a rather long pause there to serach the character map to find the command for the 'u' with an umlaut. I like to spell things properly, and Hansi's last name being German, I figured it deserved to have the proper notation. Language is important. It is the tool we use to communicate ideas, therefore I think we should respect it and use it properly lest we forget how to speak to each other in a distinguishable fashion. It is for that reason I dislike dialects of English that butcher it. Those dialects are more about the attitude of those who use them than the language. My time is running short, so I'll just type this last sentence until it's out. Oh, hey, look at that. It's not strictly a twenty minute paper. Well, as much as I wouldn't mind continuing this, I do have some work to do elsewhere. I prefer to direct my writing and creativity towards my novels and stories anyway. I'll finish them one of these days. Really, I will. &lt;/excuses&gt;  I really ought to just sit down and write them. Oh, I suppose not everyone will recognize that command in the brackets up there. It means 'end excuses', basically. It's a habit I picked up in IRC, which is an internet relay program. Technically, though, it's part of writing HTML. The backslash is the command that signifies the time to turn a variable off, or something to that effect. I could be wrong. I never really got into HTML or any other sort of coding. I don't have the patience for it. Heh. Look at that. I've already continued typing well past the timer. Anyway, I suppoe as a final note it should be said that all my 'ahh's and 'heh's and so forth are just onomatopoeia. And now my machine is gritching about IE. Bloody stupid Microsoft. Ahh well, I suppose I'l just submit this now before I get shut off and lose it. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     Today is a dreary day. The clouds and rain almost reflect the strange mood i have now. I think my thoughts have changed today. after thinking about what my mom said. I almost feel guilty. although i'm just supposed to be happy. I don't really know if what i am doing is wrong or if I just think it is because that is what i have always thought. I want to be quiet. silent. Reflective because I need some time to think and not be social. I don't want to waste any time but i don't want to look back on my time here and feel that i never had any fun. I think i am doing a good job of planning and not doing too much, but i just want to be balanced. I need to go to that church that Kelly went to , but I don't know how to get there and I feel bad that I didn't go today, even though I went to bed at 4. I need to do a better job next week. I really am begining to miss Omar and my family. Living in Austin is fun but I think I am going to get sick of it if I don't take charge of my life now. I want to do things that make a difference and not just flow with the college life. I want to be different and I haven't found exactly what I'm looking for. I still haven't found what I'm searching for. It is really hot in here. I wish I could turn the air down. but Katy is asleep. She is so crazy. I guess I like her as a room mate, it could be a lot worse. But i don't think she is at all a good role model and if anything she will bring me down if I am not careful. I really want to go shopping but I don't have time. Maybe tomorrow. I want to buy so many things. I have so many ideas but I have no money. Whoever said money does not buy happiness. was wrong. I could have so much fun if I had a whole bunch of money. I would go to all the vintage stores in Austin and have the cutest clothes and the greatest room and everything. I think then I would be more confident to go out and have fun and meet people which would bring happiness. right?? I wish that I was bulletproof. I wish Omar was here. We could have such a wonderful life if he just lived here. We need each other. He can't do anything unless i'm there to encourage him and give him advice and help. And i can't do anything unless he is here to give me inspiration and comfort and something to be joyous about. It would be so great. Oh well, i don't think that will happen. Last nite was soo crazy. But I am glad I went, just because I need to experience all that I can so I can really know what I stand for and am comfortable with. If I just stay here and do things I know, then I will never be sure if I am really being real, or just what I think is real. I need to try everything so i will  know what I'm not missing. or what I need to get more involved in. I hope Heather, Athena and I can hang out more and do things because we haven't and they are my best friends. I think it is weird how we are all here, but we never see each other. I can't belive I cut myself on my bed today. That is so retarded. And it really hurts. I think Allison is soo sweet. . we are so alive and it is so funny how Omar and Ramses live the same kind of girls that live in the same house. Haha - we live in the same house, and they live in the same house. that is so crazy. I can't belive it. I love Radiohead. it is so comforting. At least I don't really have to do chores here like at home. i am definitly free. It is a strange feeling but I really like it. It's like, i can do anything and no one will know if I don't want them to. That is a eerie and almost scary feeling. Sometimes, when I consider what tremendous consequences come from little things. I am tempted to think there are no little things.  I hope Omar will write me a song sometime. He really needs to. I can't belive we had that whole talk about little things, and i ever cried! and he still hasn't done anything. I wonder if I just stopped calling him and sending him e-mails, if he would even notice. I would think that naturally he would, but then again I can rarely predict him. He would probably not even mention it, not even miss it. That is sad. I really wish he would be different . He has such potential to be a wonderful , prime boyfriend, but i don't think he really tries as hard as he says he does. Ahh. ohh well, it will work out. I am glad i have him, because I don't want anyone else,. . no one. I a very happy with him and i know we will be so happy together when we finally figure out what we are going to do. Well, this is almost the end. The end of my moments, and feeling. i want some ice cream. . yea i do. I have so much to do today. I love this music. I want to paint. I need to create something beautiful, and be productive. This is actually the beginning. not the end. Here I go. this is going to be one great year. I have promises to keep. and miles to go before i sleep. "
Tell me about yourself.,"It's late and the fan is on it keeps spratically blowing on my arm. My arm is getting kind of cold. I have been reading for about an hour now and my eyes are kind of lazy. I have some catching up to do on my homework and i need to go get a book tomorrow, the one i got online was the wrong one. today was a long day, i'm glad it's over. three classes and a long work-out session. i like it though, the working out, it make me feel. . . good. i like to feel good. tomorrow is going to be an easy day. ony one class. my nails look bad i sure need a manicure. the fan is really relaxing with the blowing and the hum sound it makes. there is no other noise, usually there is a radio playing but not tonight, homework was the important thing. i want to do several things this week, attend some meetings for soccer and for this business fraternity that i want to be in. i think it will be fun to be involved with the school. i sure wish i could find some information on the football or baseball spirit groups. thats really what i want to do. i love watching ut play no matter what sport. i was athletic in high school i wish i would have listened to my dad when he said   you should practice, you could get a scholarship   i could have, the demand for girl golfers is pretty high. i didn't listen oh well can't cry over spilt milk. i miss my parents, i know they miss me. my mom calls alot but im glad she calls me because i would fell kind of foolish is i always called home. you know, everytime i visit i get teary eyed. i know that sounds stupid but its getting better though. i love this school though, the only school i ever wanted to go to. been a fan forever. everyone else in my family is an aggie. i will be the first longhorn in family history. pretty cool i think. i wish i could do more with my room. its too small and my closet. man i have no words for that. but i like it here, its close to school and everything else for that matter. the walking across campus kind of sucks but thats ok because its ut campus, that makes all the difference in the world. i can't believe i got into the business school. i still remember finding out like it was yesterday. i was completely speachless. literaly i had to go outside, it was one of the most liberating and self gratifying moments of my life. i am smiling right now. i have alot of pictures of my friends in my room, i miss them too. mainly my best friend kristi, she is getting married in november and i hate that i am not there to help her out with all the wedding stuff, she calls and i always do what i can while i am at home but its not the same. we were neighbors you know. for the better part of out childhood. i am usually not this depressing sounding. i guess its the long day and all the prior homework setting the mood. my arms are starting to hurt because i am typing with my comp on a stool by my bed, sitting on the edge. its a strange position but i havent yet got me a desk. . like i said the room is small and well my comp desk was big. well good night.         "
Tell me about yourself.,"     My room is so dark and cold right now. I wish my roommate didn't like to sleep as much so that I can have lights on and have the blinds open. I call my room oppressive sometimes. But I like my roommate so I am willing to compromise for her. So far, she has proven herself to be a good person and above all, a good friend. Today, when I needed someone, she was there for me. Well, today I found out there was more to a story that my boyfriend told me. I was so hurt and tearful and angry. And I felt alone. He is one of my closest friends but I can't go to him now. And so I went to her. She was there and comforted me and gave me food, which is always a sign of good friendship. She gave me advice and stuff. But I am debating whether or not I am going to take it. See, I love my boyfriend so much. I can't see myself living without him. I don't know what to do. I feel likke he has deceived me and I honestly can't trust him anymore. Trust was the thibng that I sough in him. It was the thing that I could not find anywehre else. No one but him made trust available to me. And now that feelign is gone. I really do love him though, and I am hoping that love will get me through this, but it can only go so far. I have to think of my own feelings. I have to think of what is good for me too. I shouldn't be in a relationship where trust isn't there. I shouldn't put myself in a position where I will be hurt again and again. But on one note, this is the worst thing he has ever done. He loves me so much and cares for me so much. He wouldn't hurt me for no reason. But he didn't have a reason. well in a way he did. He didn't want to tell me the truth of the situation cause he knew I would get upset and be hurt, which is the way I am now. I just wished he had told me the truth and been honest with me. I always enjoyed how we were so open and honest with each other. Now, I feel like it can't be like that. I feel it will be like that not cause we want it to be but because he knows I don't trust him and therefore he has to be honest with me so I can trust him again. Depsite all of myfeelings for him, I don't know what to do. I don't know whether I shoudl forgive him completely, give him a third chance, or just dump him. I love him to much to let him go completely so there goes option nubmer 3 but I cannot forget what he did. It will always be on my mind. I will always recall the time he deceived me. I don't like feeling deceived. It makes me feel used and disgusted with myself. I honestly feel like curling up in bed with the lights off. But then I would be doing as my roommate does. I wonder what he is thinking now. I wonder if he is really sorry for what he did. I wonder if he cares about me as much as he says he does. I can't fathom what is going on through his head. He is always thinking about stuff. He denies it but you can tell. YOu can alawys tell with soemone like that. I really do love him. I really really do. And my heart tears every time he does bad stuff to me. But this is his first time to do anything this bad. Usually he makes small mistakes like neglecting to do something. This is big. He hid something important from me. Well. . yeah he did lie to me before. And I forgave him cause it was not really that important of a lie. It was jsut the fact that he lied to me that hurt. It breaks my trust and ruins all of the faith that I have in him. I have faith in such few things. Like, I love all of my high school friends, but I know that they weren't the best to me at times. THey would leave me out and ignore me at times. My boyfriend has always proven not to be like that. He is there for me when I need him. Maybe we should be friends instead of boyfriend/girlfriend. But we tried that in the beginning and eight months later we are in love. It is probably inevitable that if we do become friends again, we would fall in love again. Our personalities are like that. We are really good together like that. Everyone says so and I feel it. I feel a connection to him that I have never felt with anyone else. It is the strongest bond that I could ever have or ever will have. I can't tell anyone how much he means to me. If they do ask, I tell them that he means the world to me. Oh God, I think I've turned to one of those codependent girls that I've always hated. Ugh, I hope not. I hate to be like. Hopfeully i am not. "
Tell me about yourself.,"  Well, I think that I need to practice working on my team games more. My teammates and I have very little coordination amongst ourselves, we always just end up doing things individually instead of as a team. Zendt usually ends up spamming huntresses by himself in a corner, Travis makes a few footman and then techs to knights, which usually then get killed, and I try to scout or tech myself. Their is no over-arching strategy to our game, which is the problem. In a one-on-one game, I only have to be concerned with what I am doing and making, and only what my single enemy is doing or making. I have decided to dub the name of our team   Team Suck  , because we are that terrible. Oh well, I can still tower rush the newbs on battle. net any day.      Amazingly enough, I don't have a lot of work to do tonight, aside from this assignment I'm doing right now so that I can go ahead and have it out of the way. Hopefully, I won't have any work to do this weekend when the fam comes to visit. And even if I do, I will just do as much as I can on Sunday night instead of burdening myself with it while they are here. It's not that I don't have a work ethic, it's just that I prioritize doing things with them above reading out of a textbook, which I will be doing all the time while I am here at UT. They are only going to be around for a few days, and then I may not see them again until the next break.     I wonder when it will start getting cold around here, I brought my jacket, but I shouldn't need it until October or so I believe. My bathroom is quite the feces-infested cesspool right now, I should probably do something about that. It's beginning to get kind of nauseating, but perhaps if I can out-last the guy next door, he will do it before I do. Pretty sick, I know, but I did it when I first got here and I'll be damned if I get to do it every time. I should also vacuum the room, that is getting pretty disgusting as well. Crumbs and such will attract all kinds of vermin eventually. I wonder how often (if ever) they spray for bugs around here. A couple of times I've gone into the bathroom and found one in the tub or on the floor. One time I actually stepped on one before I knew what it was in the dark. That was quite nasty.     There Zendt goes, IMing me while I'm doing my writing assignment. must not answer it. must continue my non-sequitious train of thought. i wonder if I spelled non-sequitious correctly. If i spent a few seconds checking it on dictionary. com it shouldn't cut into my writing. aw screw it, who cares if the prof or TA or whoever reads this thinks im an illiterate boob. I don't think they are checking on spelling anyway. I bet there are other stream of consciousness writings by students who have trouble writing in english because they are from other countries, so why should I care if i have a few typos. I could pretend I'm a foreigner from Germany or some crap, even if it did matter. Except now I've written it in here, so they would have incriminating evidence. Wow, this is too much digression into an idiotic train of thought. Must think of something else to type about. . . . . .     Um, i think I'm losing my focus a little now. man, my nails are dirty, look at that. That charcoal I've been using is a damn mess. I hope that we don't do too many more charcoal drawings now. Those blind contour drawings are so much cleaner.  I wonder if they will egver get more cups in the kitchen. I am getting pretty effin' sick of bringing my own cup to dinner. that is pure bovine-cacka. I wonder if they care about me typing cuss words in here. better not do it just to be on the safe side. Must try to maintain some false sense of professionalism. time. is. almost. . . up. . . . . NOW "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now I'm sitting in my dorm room. The TV is on and the band called   The Calling   is playing. I really like they're music, they kind of soothe my thoughts and put me at ease. Music plays an integral role in how my attitude is for a certain day or time. Many times I'll listen to something that is very hard and angry and it will put me in a bad mood, however, that rarely happens. I'm really kind of worried about my laundry at this time. I have honestly never washed any clothes, so it presents a particularly daunting task to myself. I have just realized how long 20 minutes is, and it seems a lot longer than what i figured it would be. Although this task isn't particularly challenging, it's interesting to try to think about what i'm thinking about. Many times I think the things I'm thinking of are reflected by hearing as well as sight. I've noticed this because I'm listening to music now and the song is a mellow number that is making me really relaxed. I need to make some Gatorade, because I drank all of it yesterday. Reese Witherspoon is really hot, there's a picture of her in front of me, and she is beautiful. Now there's two songs playing at the same time, and that is sort of bothering me. First of all because i like them both, second of all because it's hard to keep up with both of them. Earlier I mentioned that my laundry was bothering me, well that is really a trivial task. More precendent on my mind is making good grades in my classes. College is easy so far, however I haven't had any tests and just one quiz, in my Spanish class. I think i fared ok on that quiz, so I'm happy about that. However, I'm still very curious as to what I actually made. When i first got to Jester my allergies acted up really bad, due to the inordinate amount of dust in the room. After the first week I got acclimated to it, I guess, and now I'm doing just fine. I had an appointment at the SSB to get my allergy shots this afternoon, so I treked over there after I ate lunch. When i got there the lady informed me that she had double booked the nurse in charge of giving shots. She was paranoid that I would be mad at her, but of course I wasn't mad. It takes a lot to get me mad, and something like that is just a minor inconvenience to me. So I just went about my way. I am also happy that I got my computer problem resolved. Seether put on a great show at Ozzfest on Saturday. Their lead singer sounds a lot like Kurt Cobain, who was awesome. All of Seether's songs were really great, they impressed me. Chevelle put on a good show too, as did Lost Prophets. Wow, I find myself continually looking at the time above, to see how close I am to getting finished with this assignment. I'm really thirsty. Another thing that perplexes me is the experiments for this class. I suppose I'll try to sign up for something after I finish this typing assignment. I'm really kind of worried about getting all those experiments done and all that. I guess that worry stems from not knowing that much about the experiments. Lately my feet have started hurting a little bit, well, i guess it's not really a   hurt  , but more of a burn. Perhaps my soles are giving out. Wow, I'm almost finished, I have less than 15 seconds left. This was really kind of cool, the 20 minutes went by pretty fast, bye. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     For the past two weeks, I've been down here in Austin, TX, home of the largest university in the nation, and while I thought that I would have the time of my life, I cannot seem to move past the feeling that I am completely alone in a world of 50,000 students. I had wanted to come to this university for five years, but now that I'm here, im constantly thinking of ways to either get out or somehow to get used to it. The fact is, I left my friends. Although this is something that everyone going to college is faced with, the friends I left were the only ones that I had kept for more than 4 years since my family moved around often. And this time, leaving them was actually my decision!  I continually tell myself to just give it time and I will find my place. However, as I struggle being in a new city by myself, it seems that everyone that I talk to is having the time of their lives:  the time that I wanted and expected to have upon arrival in Austin. Wanting to transfer closer to where my friends are occuppies much of my thoughts each and every day. I just can't move past it. It's as if the world is moving on without me. I feel as if I'm lost, and I don't know how to find myself again. Either I stay here and attempt to find the dream I had expected, or I find a way out of the city. Everyone seems so happy. Why can't I be like them?  I miss everything about my home, but most of all I miss how familiar everything was. I knew what was going to happen every day, and here, I don't know what to do with  myself!  Anyway, I really wish my roommate would come home every now and then!  I hardly see her. I miss my boyfriend so much!  I sound like such a typical teenage girl in saying that, but it's true. I miss my life before college. I hadn't realized how happy and lucky I truly was to have such amazing friends and family close by all the time. Perhaps I just need to get out there and truly find someone to talk to, but it feels like I've tried that already. I wish so much that I could just meet someone and right away have a friend! It's ridiculous to think that way, but honestly, the world would be a much friendlier place!  Okay, so now it seems like I'm just rambling on. I should go running sometime soon, but it's extremely hot outside!!  I cannot wait for this weekend because I have a ride home. See, I continually come back to this topic. I desperately hope that I maintain the same relationship with my friends. I feel so stressed out lately. I don't know what to expect yet from college, and calculus is absolutely killing me!  If I don't get an extremely high GPA, I might HAVE to transfer universities in order to get accepted into business. Why couldn't my life have just stood still during my senior year of high school?  I loved it, only I didn't know that I had the life I always wanted until I was forced to leave it and start over. I sound as if my life is falling apart, and it's not. Sometimes I just feel too overwhelmed with making new friends and meeting new people, keeping in touch with everyone and wishing they were here with me, and then there's the little fact that I'm supposed to decide what to do with the rest of my life at some point soon!  Business is just so general, so I thought it would be a great starting point. Who knows?  Definitely not me. I'm so confused right now. People are outside running right now. I should get out there and attempt to keep in shape. "
Tell me about yourself.,"so , i am supposed to write what i think. thats sorat hard, because everytime you think a thought, it has disappeared by the time you have finished wirrint it. but at the moment i would like to talk about the one thing that is on lmy mind: my mother  yes, she is my mother, and yes, she is extremely overprotective. but i am in COLLEGE now . that is a wee different than high school in the sense that you have ot be. o whats the word. . independent   will do. yea you have to think for yourself, stand up for yourself, be yoursefl. except if your mother is preventing you from doing that, what are you supposed to do? if she doesnt let you come home later than whatever time she setss (which by the way is not very late at all) then you are basically in 9th grade again. do this, do that. and the worst part is, she never directly states what is on her mind. she starts out by asking questions. where were you all this time? i was worrying? why didnt you tell me?  i did ma. i don't remember  well thats too bad . i have to go tomorrow as well  where? when? till what time?  who what where when why and how, she might as well be a journalist. she instilled morals and values on me. doesnt she trust her own upbringing?  doesnt she trust me?  trust is anothe issue and overprotectiveness is another. or at least i think she is being overprotective. maybe to her indian standards she is extremely liberal. maybe. but this isnt india! this is the us, land of freedom. not that i'm going to go off and elope with some pierced stranger. i just want some privacy, some freedom. and most of all i want to move out. that in itself would solve so many problems. first of all, i wouldnt have to listen to her critisizing me one moment and loving methe next. she also would be liberated from my constant bickering and un called for interruptions. i wouldnt be too far away and yet not close enough to be distracted. everytime i try to study, she comes in every 15 to 20 mts. unless of course if she is taking a   nap   of 3 hours or so. but i feel guilty. i feel guilty for the way i am thinking. she deserves that nap, every second of it. if i worked as hard as she does, i would be half unconscious by now. but she finds time for a full time job, for being a single mother, for paying bills, for making food, for everything you would want a mother to do, as well as everything you wish she wouldnt do. she is the epitome of motherhood, in all its glory and grime. she has her pro's and cons, and i love her for that. but sometimes she can be a real pain.  enought about her, i still have 12 minutes of writing left. what can i write about. lets see, college. yes college is most definitely on my mind at the moment, because i am doing a college assignment. i also have a bunch of homework to do after this and it is already 10 pm. i am not too good at doing all nighters. the latest i have slept is 5 am. and that was not study related. that was lets have a girl cousin talk thing.  but that aside, college seems to be hard, but not as hard as i had thought it to be. i am not completely clueless as to what is beingsaid in my classes, but at the same time, i am quite amazed at the amount of reading that has to be done. its not the reading actually, its the note taking that is required in intense detail and that takes up a whole lot of time. i am trying to think of what to think and it isnt working too well, so i'll just write about my family. well theres my brother and i could go on and on about him. personally i think he's a spoiled brat. he has as much potential as his fourteen yr old cerebrum can handle, but that potential is over ridden by his spoiled bratedness. he is plain spoiled , by my mother mostly. when i was his age ( now why does that sound so familiar. . i am not that old, am i?) i was super disciplined by my father; the beatings, the cruel and unusual punishments, the whole package. yes, so i think i am definitely more responsible. whereas my younger sibling, he has the disadvantage of being not only a spoiled brat, but an extremely lazy spoiled brat. he reads a lot, and thats pretty much the only good thing about him. another controversial curse in the form of a blessing is that he can phase out the rebukes of my mother. now one minute ago i was critisizing him and now i'm commending him, but not really. it only seems to be a boon at certain times, like if i really did not want to hear my mother tell me how all the other girls my age are doing jobs and iam sitting around and my legs are gettin fat andn how i should exercise more. because she has already said it 10 times that week and wishes to say it once more, as if i couldnt hear her say it 10 times, whereas i actually could. that didnt sound like it made sense. but yea. this stream of consciousness thing, i did it in senior yr ap english. my teacher, mrs. lydic was one . . uh. . unique lady. she was somewhat crazy in the sense that she drank unbelievely outrageous amounts of coffee and had this almost supernatural smirk/ smile on her face. and her hair was always the exact same way. side parting with a big dome of hair on the top. yes i sound so shallow in this  callow description of her physical faults, but it was that mingled with her personality that made the ap english experience not really unpleasant, but unusual. so after i discovered that i had to do a stream of consciousness paper in psychology i thought, i can never get rid of lydic. she will always be there. not that thats a bad thing. i suppose it is thanks to her ( and my own diligent efforts) that i got a 4 on the english literature advanced placement exam. but now i have less than 30 secons left and i would just like to say, this soc paper didnt really provide a catharsis for me. "
Tell me about yourself.," I hope I'm doing this right because I'm not sure. I feel so tired and I have so many things to do in such short time. I wonder if I'll pass all my classes. I'm afraid that I won't make A's and not make it into Medical school. I can imagine how my dad's sisters will laugh at him and tell him that they knew I wasn't going to make it. I feel lost, depressed, and anxious. Who should I talk to, well mayb nobody because what if people think I'm crazy or stupid or something. Everyone else seems relaxed and having a great time. I can't even walk out of my room because I either have homework or some quiz to study. I can't believe I froze today on my quiz and miss two simple questions. What's wrong with me? I used to take pressure fine now I feel like some crazy person. I miss Peter, my boyfriend. He understands me. The good thing is that he's coming down and if my dad brings my truck up here, I can go and pick him up at the airport. I want to bring him back to UT and show him around. It's going to be nice to walk with him down the Drag and just showing him the campus. I can't wait to see him. I hope everything goes well since tomorrow is Friday the thirteenth. I don't want anything to happen to him while he's flying over here. If anything happens to him, I'll feel terrible because I'm the only reason he's coming down. I hope I can have a good weekend with him. I want to spend as much time as possible with him. But with my parents, God, I can imagine them. They take things so seriously. I wish they weren't so strict and understand that me and Peter are serious about each other. I guess that's why I'm so shy. I could never go out or do anything. Now I can't keep a conversation with anyone because I think that they don't like me but oh, well I don't need them. I have such a headache. It's just all these thoughts I have in my head. I wonder who's going to read this. They're going to think I'm some kind of psycho, however you spell that. Life is so crazy for me. I can never relax or kick back. I hope to God that in the end this will pay off. I wish I was already in med school but hey it all takes time. Now I understand what Dr. Sladek said. That man is so brillant. I hope to be just like him. He does surgeries like nothing. And to think that he didn't make it to med school here in the US and had to go to Mexico. If he didn't make it with straight a's here at UT, what makes me think that I will. What did I get myself into? But this is my dream and I'm afraid to disappoint my family. I've always told them I was going to be a Doctor and if I don't they're going to ask me why, some will laugh at me, others will disapprove of me like Mr. Matthews, others will rub it in my face. How embarrassing? Agh! I even got voted most successful in high school. I can imagine everyone talking about me and how I thought I was so smart. If only they knew I had to work really hard for my grades. I was just like them. I want my mom to be proud of me and I want her to know that when she's old I'll take good care of her. I don't want to see her working hard anymore. Well this felt a little better taking everything out but now I feel like crying. Maybe that will help as well.    "
Tell me about yourself.,"so today i went to class and i am really really tired i don't know why because in high school i was never this tired and i never slept that much during the day now i sleep a lot more i have breaks in between my classes and i don't like it because i don't do anything useful during those breaks i either eat, sleep, watch my suitemates tv or sit and stare at the wall, i think that i have a obessive compulsive shopping disorder because i always want to shop i like to shop and i always spend too much money i have the money from my parents but i should learn to save it but they did give it to me for clothes but i still shouldnt shop that much well oh well i like it so i do it i really like my dorm i want to decorate the living room more but my roommate and my room is cute and everyone says that it is homely i hung up all my picutes the other day and i like it alot i really like my stuff i think it is extremely cute it looks like a model dorm room it should because it took me forever to pick out what to buy and i got frames for all my pictures to match and my mom is making me a lamp to match it is going to be awesome well now my boyfriend is going to come over and we are going to watch a movie that should be fun oh i forgot that are suitemates are having movie night oh well we can just watch it with them i never get pimples but i have a really huge one right now and it is aggrevating me to death i guess that i am really concerned with my physical appearance but i can't help it anyways i don't know what else to write umh the elevators at dobie are extremely annoying because they take forever and i always have to take the stairs from the 12 floor i hate it but i never take them up maybe i should to work off calories oh that reminds me i really need to start working out again i have slacked off since summer school ended and fall started i should start running again too i could go with my friend i will give her a call later well something is wrong with my labtop because any time i type too fast it stops and sends me to the upper portion of the page i hate it then i have to use the mouse to get back down to start typing again i think that i am a true perfectionist it even shows in this writing assignment because anytime i spell a word wrong i have to go back and retype it the right way i wonder why i do that oh i miss my car because i put it in the shop yesterday and i can't get it until tomorrow it is no big deal i don't drive it that much down here anyway but i just like to know that i can drive when i want to it is going to cost like 270 dollars to get the oil changed and the brake pads changed and the rotars grinded down they also had to give me a new ignition for something because of a recall i have a 98 honda accord (it is so nice i love my car fully loaded and everything all the extras) and they recalled the ignition because it can just stall out when you are driving that is scary my stepmom called me and was worried because if i was driving on the freeway and it stalled it would not be good i said hey if someone hit me and maybe i would just get hurt enough so that i could sue honda and get enough money to pay for college and be able to drive my bmw and go on shopping sprees with my sisters, and mothers and all the time that would be nice so i havent talked to my sister in awhile she is very sick not sick in a flu way but in a internal way like the brain and heart i love her so much and i am going to call her as soon as i am done with this so that i can tell her how much i love her and when i go home we can hang out and i will take her and some of her friends to a movie and to eat i think that i need to get a job my dad does not want me too and he gives me money but i want to you know "
Tell me about yourself.,"     Today is Friday and I am feeling sad because my I had been hoping to see my boyfriend Justin this weekend. Actually, originally I had planned to see him next weekend because this weekend he was supposed to be going to La Grange. But then his trip to La Grange got cancelled and I was hoping that he would be able to come up and visit me. But it just wasn't going to happen in this short of notice because we had too many other things going on this weekend. But next weekend I will see him because I am driving down to Houston next Friday. I am so excited because by then it will have been three weeks since we last saw eachother. Next Sunday, September 15 is his brothers' birthday. He has two brothers, they are twins. Their names are Jack and John. They will be turning 11. This weekend I am going to buy them birthday cards. The only problem is that I'm not sure which name to put on one of the cards because now John wants to be called Hunter for no particular reason. So I want to be nice and call him by the name he wants to be called, but I also think that those kind of nicknames are dumb. By that I mean nicknames that are derived from nowhere. A nickname should contain at least some semblance of the person's actual name. But I want to be nice to his brother. I am very tired right now. I didn't get enough sleep last night, I stayed up late talking to my roommate about the most random stuff. I had planned to take a nap after my 10:00 class, but I got sidetracked, and I had that guilty feeling that I should be studying. So I went to the library and studied a little bit. And now it is 3:00 on Friday afternoon and I really have nothing to do. That has been a common theme during my two-week college experience so far: having nothing to do. My roommate is one of my best friends from high school, and all senior year we were so excited about coming to college. And I really like it here a lot, but I guess it takes awhile for things to pick up. But I have been meeting a lot of people in the dorm and some people in my classes. At first I was unbelievably homesick, it came in waves. I'd be ok for awhile, and then all of a sudden something would remind me of Justin or home or my parents or something and I'd feel like I wanted to cry. Now that things have settled into sort of a routine I feel better. And I know it just takes time. I can sort of gauge everything that happens to me during college to what happened to my brother, because when he started college he was in the same situation I am in - he was in a long distance relationship. But he went to A&M. Also, his girlfriend was still in high school, and my boyfriend is the same age as me. But he was miserable, I remember how sad he was. He used to come home every weekend. But he was in College Station, only about an hour from home. Anyways, I wouldn't even want to be like that. I don't want to seem like I can't handle things and I have to run back to Justin all the time. But I really miss him and I have this lost feeling, like I'm not sure what to do with myself. My roommate went downstairs to get her laundry. She had a little package slip in the mail too. Justin said that I should check my mail today and I did, but I didn't get anything, so I don't know what he's talking about. It's a very cloudy day today. I am supposed to do this homework assignment for my astronomy class where I have to observe the sky and measure the angles of different stars. So I hope it clears off later. The other problem is I can't find a place from where I can do it. At first I thought I would just go to the top of the Jester parking Garage, so I did that last night, but it wasn't tall enough - I couldn't see the horizon behind all the tall buildings and stuff. So I'm not sure exactly what I'm going to do about it. It is actually stressing me out, because I just don't know what to do. I hope I will figure out something this weekend. The homework is not due until Thursday. But I'd rather get it over with. My roommate just came back and said that I did have a letter from Justin. That is weird because I checked the mail earlier and there was nothing for me. So I'm excited now. Now she is folding her laundry. I did my laundry yesterday. It is so expensive, 75 cents a load. That is why I'm going to take my laundry home next weekend.   "
Tell me about yourself.,"     I'm feeling that I miss my girlfriend in San Antonio. As we do this i feel that she is my everthing i can't get her out of my head. what else I can't get out of my head is this music that the dorm next door to me is playing, it is making me really frustrated because i can't think quite as well. I hope that Jess is okay, i worry about her a lot. She doesn't sleep too well, and that kind of worries me but she is extremely strong so i'm not too worried about it. I am kind of worried about what she just wrote to me in a letter i got. I know that she loves me but this college stuff, being apart and all is quite difficult. I don't like it and neither does she, and she wrote something that worries me, that she kind of wishes that we never met so that we never fell in love and therefore never have to endure the hardship of parting. I miss her a lot. My days primarily consist of me waiting around for her to get to her computer so I can instant message her, and communicate with her, truly the highlight of my day. The rest of my day is that of school, college that is, and I feel somewhat like a hermit but not too much, because I have her. She really is my everything, and I know that we will be together, forever. One thing that I do feel uneasy about is the fact that she is a christian and that I am an Atheist. This hasn't played a part in our relationship, but I'm afraid that one day it will. I am a pacifist Atheist and therefore will usually ignore most people's idea's, I know that that is wrong but oh well it's the way that I feel. I really don't want to destroy her sense of spirituality either, I've done it before to other people and it really makes them feel bad, and lost. I don't ever want to hurt Jess, I love her, in fact I feel that I have to protect her from everything. I miss her, I don't like the fact that I have to be here in Austin and she is nearly by herself in San Antonio. But there is a glimer of hope, we might get an apartment together next year. I really hope that we do, that would be so great. I can think of nothing better than waking up to her smiling face everyday, and thinking to myself that I am the luckiest guy in the world. I hope that that happens, it really does help to have something that you can think about while you are away from someone that you love. All I can think about is how great it is when I make my bi-monthly trips during the weekends to see her. In fact I'm trying to plan something this weekend for her to make her feel as special as she really is. I think the world of Jess. I don't know what I'm going to plan yet, I just can't think with this music, it really does irritate me quite a bit, I'm thinking that after the twenty minutes are up that I will go over there and tell them to turn it down. I love Jess. I wish that I was with her right now, in fact sometimes I wish that I didn't have to go to college, just stay with her were we used to work forever. Just being together with nothing to stop us, no one to get in the way, and no time constraints placed upon us. I love her very much. Wow, I just looked at the clock and I have used 17 minutes already, only three to go. Man, my fingers are getting tired from typing so much. I can usually get about 30 words a minute out, but I'm out thinking my typing, I want to write something down, and then bam another thought is in my head, my fingers can't keep up. I sure hope that I finish soon, because I see that my Jess is online and that I want to talk to her real soon, this is the stuff that I wait hours for, just a chance to talk to her to be with her always. She is my everything, and I care for her deeply. I do get to see her on Friday and I'm really happy. I hope that she will have as much fun as I will. I can't stop thinking about Jess. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     Well, here goes. I'm listening to all of the songs i've fuond over the last few days and am slowly getting tired of them. I'm worried about my typing skills too. I've gotten worse and i can't figure out why. Maybe it's the keyboard, or maybe it's the desk. I doubt it's becuase i'm always in a hurry. Why would that be it? I really like this next song though. I hope my roommate is able to get to the movie tonight because i don't want her to miss it. I'm glad that i found someone to go with though. That would be horrible if i hadn't! I'm getting really frustrated that i can't seem to get this Welcome Package! Really, who locks their doors when they know everyone has to get in!! Maybe i'm just really weak and can't get in. No no. . that's not it. They locked their doors. I'm going to have to ask Sarah to go with me. I also need to call Amy. Grr. i don't want to do that , but it would be rude not to call her. What else? I need to go to the gym, but that's another thing i don't want to do alone and sarah's to lazy to go. I'm really excited that there are going to be 5 fred movies in a row this month! What luck! And a   road   movie!! It just proves that soemtimes dreams really do come true. hahha. well, maybe. I just hope i'm able to go home to see it because it comes on really early in the morning and i don't think my roommate would like me to much if i woke her up to watch a movie. Of course, she is a heavy sleeper, so she might not even notice. Man, my arms are getting tired. i don't why that is. i guess i should relax and just sing along.  i'm singing in the rain!   hmmm. . that's not working to well. I really wish i could go home more often because i do not like what the water is doing to my hair. It looks horrible, but i shouldn't care because i've never cared before. Of course, my hair has never looked to so bad before. I'm really tired too. I want to read something interesting for once. I wish I had my Entertainment Weekly already, but nooo, i have to wait till Sept. 27. That's a long time! I don't know if I can wait that long. I need something! I'm dying over here without a book! I have cable now, but that's no substitute. I am glad that the cable has TCM and Cartoon Network. It's weird how my taste changed this summer. I never thought I would be into the PowerPuff Girls, but I am. i really always thought they're name was PowDerPuff Girls. Oops. It's a cute show though. I can't decide who i like the most. It's just one of those shows where the jokes are really subtle, so it makes me feel smart when I get them. Not to many shows can do that nowadays. It's like the movies. Not to many movies make you think anymore. I really wanted to ask Stacy today if she had ever seen Charade because that is a good movie. It makes you think because who would have suspected the guy it was? Of course, once you watch it the second time it's not as good, but that first viewing is great! There are other movies too. The Game was a good one! The one with Micheal Douglas right? That's what the movie is called i believe. I was so shocked. . in fact it's been so long since I've seen it taht i really don't remember what all happened, i just know it made you think. I wish people would come out with more of those movies. Why don't they? Did they decline in popularity? The same question goes for musicals? Why don't they make dancing movies anymore? Of course I've seen some of the more recent dancing movies and they didn't do well at the box office. Maybe the plot could have been better. Plus, today everything has to do with sex appeal. If a movie doesn't have that at least in one spot it's a flop. Ginger and Fred never had to have that. I think the idea of sexual tension helped them out enough. Of course, people used to go see movies just for the actors. People today go for the actors and actresses but they also go for what happens. Why did people go see Fast and the Furious? Because they knew Vin Diesel would show off his body and everything. The movie itself was crap. the plot was zilch. Whatever happened to good comedians too? I'm listening to Jack Benny now and although I don't always understand the jokes, I can tell he was a man many people loved and admired because he's so clean. It doesn't take much to make people laugh, but today the jokes can be so dirty that it's not always funny. I admit i laugh sometimes, but you can't help but feel bad. I hope the movie tonight is worthwhile. Everyone says it's great, obviously because it's a box-office hit. I think it's so great that there's a place where one can view movies for free. Who knew that college would be so nice? I miss my family a lot but i like being able to go out and do other things without having to ask first. I do feel like i have to ask but something stops me everytime. Mom doesn't have to know everything. haha. I hope everyone comes up here soon. Ok, the sound effects man on this episode is rather annoying. After listening to a radio show once you don't want to listen to it to often. The same goes with songs, but i can deal with that. I need to find a Tv guide so i know when Seinfeld and Raymond comes on. It bothers me that i'm missing those. I don't like the guide on the TV, it's hard to follow. Plus, it would be nice to have the guide like at home. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     so i don't know exactly what im supposed to write about here. i guess whatever is on my mind at the moment. my roomate is watching some wierd movie right now and the lady in it is screaming about something going wrong. and her husband is talking on the phone to another woman. maybe he's cheating on her with this other woman. who knows?  so it's 4:22 right now and I don't want to what else to write about. . i would really like to be listening to Dashboard Confessional right now. they are such an awesome band!  i really am getting into them lately!  Chris has got such an amazing voice. . plus he's gorgeous!  i went and saw DC last month. that was a great show!  i want to see them agian. tehy need to come to Austin soon. they would have a great turnout if they did!  last night i went to a concert. . it was at the Austin Music Hall. Jimmy Eat World, Sparta, and Cave-in all played. . Jimmy was amazing!  Sparta was a lot better yesterday than the last time that I was them with Dashboard and Weezer!  I actually kind of liked their music!  And then Cave-in was alrigth too. I had fun watching the drummer's ab and arm muscles move around and work as he played bis drums with his shirt off!  it was nice!  why is it that all drummers play with their shirts off?  i guess they just like to be topless. and have all the girls stare at them. or maybe it's just a sweat thing as Baxter says. who really knows?  Baxter is a cool girl. im glad that i met her at orientation. . i have soo much fun hanging out with her. . but chris is great!  he is soo funny!  and hes so sweet too!  i hope he gets my email about wanting to be study buddies with him for french class. . . that would be a great help!  plus you know i'd be able to see chris more often. . wahoo!  he is soo adorable. but really. i do need the help in french. thats one of those classes that you really have to work hard at every single day in order to get good at and stay good at. . he seems to be doing pretty well in there. especially since he took french longer than i did. maybe a year more. but who really cares. he is better at it than i am. or so i think. i hope he wants a study buddy too for that class. because i really want to do better on my next test in there. i want to pul my grade up from a b to an a, which i won't be able to do unless i get help from someone else. and chris would be the perfect person to get that help from. anyway. im getting tired of typing everyhting that comes into my mind. . . but i guess thats exactly what everyones blogs are about. just them randomly typing waht they are thinking about and sharing it with everyone!!!  john sur is good at that. he always has something interesting or intellectual or funny to say in there. . its great!  i am soo glad that we became friends. he really does seem to make me feel smarter just because he teaches me so much!  especially and my faith. . he really has influenced me and helped me out so much with that. . i don't know what i would have done without him. his everlasting questions and curiosity have made me wonder and become more curious myself about my own faith and i thank him for that. also for him and holly inviting me to the bible study back home!  that really helped me out tremendously!  i don't know what i would have done without that group of people. some of them have become my best friends this past year and i don't know how my life would be different without them!!  they really do make me feel like a better person for knowing them. . and i thank them from the bottom of my heart for them always being there for me with all of the neverending support!  i miss all of them soo much here at college. but at least i ahve a few of them here at UT. John and Chris are here. and I'm glad about it!  they really make me feel more at home here even though i may not see them all the time. . they are such great friends!!!!  oh and my fig!  its amazing!  im soo glad that i signed up for it. . it truly does help you feel more at home here in school and make UT feel like a smaller campus. because i really don't think that it seems like it is as big as everyone says it is. i mean. i see people i know everywhere. . . wheter they are in my fig. i went to high school with them. . middle school. orientation. camp texas. or i just know them from something else. i see poeple that i know everywhere and I'm glad of it it sooo nice to be able to that! "
Tell me about yourself.,"     So I started my college life about two weeks ago. It has all gone pretty much as to what I had expected it to be like. I live in University Towers which is an off campus dorm and I have met tons of new people. I live with four girls whom I didnt know when I first started school. Some older people at the University set us up. I really like the fact that we are all starting new with each other. We get to experience our new life together. We get along great and do everything together. I am also really enjoying the fact that I get to make all my decisions on my own. Not having parents around all the time has its up's and it's downs. I mean I don't have someone annoying me all the time about finishing my work I have to realize when it has to be turned in and different deadlines for tests and projects. I have however found it kind of difficult to really take on a full schedule and truly realize everything that has to be taken care of in one full day. I have noticed that there aren't enough hours in the day to get everything completly finished. With homework, reading, running errands and outside activites there is so much to do with so little time. My roomate and I have had grown very close over the past two weeks. We have developed many habbits that we both enjoy. We realized that it takes the longest for the two of us to get ready and we love listening to music while we get ready because it pumps us up and gets us excited. I feel that the two of us are only going to get closer as our college life unfolds itself. We both experienced Texas Recruitment together. We both wanted to join the same sorority so that we could have another aspect of our life in college together to be the same. We accomplished another goal of us and we both got bids to the same sorority. I feel at home whenever I am at the house. Each and every girl is excited with open arms to welcome all 63 of the new pledges. I am so glad that not only are we roomates with each other we are sorority sisters as well. Other than my social life and living arrangements at school, the most important aspect is my education. I am taking 4 classes which comes out to 14 hours. I chose the classes that I wanted to take and the first two weeks have gone great. The work load started off fine and I think that I am going to be able to handle everything. I was a little nervous at first about the large classes because I came from a high school that was a decent size but the classes ranged from 10-35 people. My classes at Texas on the other hand were quite large. I didnt know if I was going to be able to concentrate during a lecture if there were on average 100-300 people in the classes. As soon as one day passed I knew it wouldnt be a problem as long as I got to class early so that I would have a decent seat and be able to listen as closly as I could. As these last two weeks have flown by I have realized differnt tecniques to make the rest of my experiences at Texas even better. I have learned from my mistakes and I have gained from my experiences.                       "
Tell me about yourself.,"     Why do people always seem to stress out over the most petty   and unimportant things? It seems as though when we leave the   mundane routine of college life and enter the college atmosphere   that our perceptions and opinions of people and things become all   the more important. When my roommate and I went shopping at the   Galleria mall this weekend these petty issues seemed ever present.  Girls shopping beside us charging obscene amounts of money   onto daddy's credit cards. Have many teens forgotten about the   value and importance of money? I also this weekend began to   wonder why some guys are so hung up on their appearances and   homophobic. My new friend Kenny happens to be fixated on getting   dates/girlfriend and there is this guy in his complex who really likes   him. The entire time at the mall Kenny asked my roommate and I if   random people were   hotter   than he was. This relentless insecurity   and constant echo of self degredation was honestly quite draining.  Why can't people just accept that they are who they are and be happy   at that? Society's fixation on appearances and wealth have truly   begun to mask what is ultimately important in friendships and   relationships. Most people seek relationships on all levels with   people who share the same interests and personality traits that   support their own beliefs and that can reciprocate other ideas that   they themselves may not think on their own. Why is love and   relationships always such a larghe chunk of a teen's life. I myself   have realized recently that I've spent a great many years in   relationships loving someone and being loved in return. We as a   society place so much emphasis on dating, relationships, and   marriage that our thoughts and actions always seemed aimed at   such goals. I mean look at the fixation that many college age   individuals have on dating shows. In high school many an AP   Calculus class were spent discussing Elimidate and the trashy or   sexy guys/girls that were on the particular episode. I myself admit to   watching the trash, but for some reason society has aimed my eye   to these sort of shows. Since I arrived on campus dorm life has truly   agreed with me. I worried for months that my roomate would be just   dreadful of that we would have little to nothing in common.  Fortunately, my roommate and I have a great deal in common and   are turning out to be great friends. The University has also provided   me with many unexpected opportunities. Besides the rec center, I'm   signing up for rock climbing, the music school has turned out to be   unexpectedly positive. I have played the violin since I was 8 years old   . In the past year I have realinzed that I genuinely desired to teach   music in elementary school. When I arrived at UT on the first day of   school I was terrified of auditioning for the UT Symphony orchestra.  When I arrived outside of professor Noe's office I was greeted by   many unfamiliar faces of musicians much older than me. My nerves   seemed to overwhelm me as I walked in the room. All I could think   about was trying not to rush or let my nerves get the best of me. I felt   that the audition went well but I was forced to wait the entire   weekend for the results. As it turned out my audition had gone as   well as I had felt. I was seated 10th chair in the orchestra in the 1st   violin section. I can't wait for tomorrow to start yet another exciting   adventure in my college career and meet more new and exciting   people. Alas, I have to go to work and spend my entire weekend   hosting, babysitting, and waiting tables. Hopefully everyone will   come home from college on Friday so we can catch up on all the   new happenings and just relax and enjoy each other's company. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     The library is so boring. I can't stand more than two hours of library a day. Daily discussion sections can be really useless in the long run for easy classes, one would be better off studying. It is hard to write a stream of consciousness when typing and especially being in a library with other people around you. There are too many distractions and I believe this particular writing assignment to be more effective on my behalf in a different environment. Time is tricky in that it seems to move by faster than expected when it is divided into units, I divide my day into units of time rather than just saying that I have to be in class for an hour, i consider this one unit of time and everything just works out as planned. I wonder if people have a preference on which computer to use when they enter a computer lab, I mean location of the computer, I have a preference for the computers in the back corner or at least at the end of the row. I have am uncomfortable with people sitting behind me or even next to me when there is a chance I may be watched. I am not really following the rules of stream of consciousness because i am using punctuation marks and there is no real stream with punctuation marks. It is hard not to, may be there is something psychologically wrong with a person who  uses punctuation in a stream of consciousness one thing is for certain is that the person may be a little occupied by trivial matters. a beautiful girl just walked in so she is on my mind so since she is on my mind i will write about her, she is wearing a black dress, knee high and a tan beld with tan shoes, i wonder why she dressed like that to go to the library and use a computer, awesome she is now sitting at the computer next to me if i wasnt in a stream on consciousness may be i would talk to her, probably not i am not good with those type of situations anyway, i guess i shouldnt write about her when she may glance over and see my writing about her enough of that, where was i in my original thoughts before this incident occured, i believe i was talking about time and how controlling it can be when dealt with in the wrong way our whole society is so structured on this intangible object its amazing when you dwell and also can get confusing. i think i may just move to spain where time is not that big of a deal, at least thats what my high school sociology teacher told me, she was an attractive lady who had just got out of college and she really liked me, not in a sexual way, she had a wonderful family, and her child was very beautiful, i hope one day i may have the chance to have such a nice child. anyway, our relationship was good, she even invited me to the movies and many dinners at her house, it was awkward, but  i soon became kind of close with that family, she knew my mother was living in austin and wanted to just kind of have the experience of a teenage son i guess i recall those two years and i feel extremely happy and encouraged by that woman and she helped me deal with not having a mother "
Tell me about yourself.,"     I just got home from my boyfriends house. He is so wonderful. We have so much in common. I love him so much. He is a Christian and so am I. When we spend time together i feel like i am on top of the world just as happy as could be. That is how i am feeling right now that is why i am writing about him. I think about him all the time. When we are not together i wish we were. i can never be without him and not be missing him. He is just so funny, hes so cute, hes so wonderful. I wish he were here with me right now. He is caring and loving and we have a great time when we are together from when we are kissing to hugging to playing board games with his family. When i came home from his house i was going to try to send a card to my friend for his birthday, but when i was looking online for cards to send i was beginning to get frustrated that i could not find any that i liked so i started looking at other cards like pictures of cute babies that people had sent. I love to be around children and they seem to like me too. I hope to have some of my own one day. but that will be after college. I want to wait til I am married, that is very important to me. Even though sometimes i have to admit it is not easy. Me and my boyfriend have talked about getting married one day. I really wish he was here right now. but hes at the store with his mom shopping because she does not feel very well right now. I love his family so much. His parents are 2 of the most awesome christian people and the cutest couple you will ever meet. If me and my boyfreind do get married i want to be just like them. They have been married like 20 something years and are still completely in love with eachother like they had just started thier relationship togehter. YOu can see in in how they look at eachother how they talk to eachother just eerything about them. Davids sisters are amazing too. They are truely a lot of fun.  They are 28 and almost 31 years old. So they are quite a bit older than he is. Whenever i go over to his house they always joke around with us talking about inlaws and stuff like that. I think they think we will get married some day too. I hope we do. When i first started dating him even within the first couple of weeks I could already sit in his house and picture bringing the kids over to the grandparents house. His parents would make awesome grandparents too. They are also really good with kids. His sisters would be really fun aunts too. His middle sister Amy is getting married in december or january when her fiance gets back from Germany with the VISA. Hes really cool too. I just got really happy because my boyfreind just sent me a message saying he was home but i had to say be right back so i could write more about him. He is the last thing i think about when i go to bed and of course i dream about him and hes the first thing i think about when i wake up. Another thing that is really neat about our relationship is that we do a bible study and devotional together every day. It really helps up to grow closer to eachother and to God who is number 1 in our relationship. My Christianity is really important to me. I was raisedin a Christian home and brought up in church. I am so greatful for my parents and all that they have taught me. They are also still married and i consider myself very lucky to have them since most people now are not as fortunate to have thier parents still together. Me and my mom are very close and i tell her a lot. We have a very open relationship and can depend on eachother for anything. She even gets these gut type feelings about things for example when I started dating David and he spent some time here at the house she told me one night that   she had a good feeling about this one.  meaning she really liked him and could see this relatioship lasting a long time. And so far she is right and i don't see her being wrong any time soon. I am glad that i still live at home while i am going to UT because I don't know where i would be without her. I am not very independent but i am working on that because i know i can not live at home forever. The good thing about living at home besides free food an laundry is that my boyfriend also lives at home with his parents and he only lives like 5 minutes or less from me.  "
Tell me about yourself.,"     here we go. i don't think my typing can keep up with my thoughts. the palm reader said a few weeks ago, that i was very mentally busy. anyways, this red hot chili peppers is pretty good, although i don't like that cabron song. i wonder if you get penalized for not writing as much. should just take the easy way out and claim i am a slow typer. so this is what college is like. doesn't seem so bad right now. i heard the first year was easy. this class could be a little tough, but the professor seems to know what he is doing. i wish i could type without making mistakes. that would be cool. i wonder if lisa will call me today. we seemed to really hit it off the other day, and she does seem interested. i wonder if that is just her personality to be really nice or what. hard to tell if she has a lot of other guy friends or not. my roommate got back quickly from houston already. kind of pathetic only going for one night to see his girlfriend. i don't know why that makes me upset, i guess because she is still is high school and he talks like a moron when he calls her on the phone. back to lisa as usual. i can't believe she likes all the same music as me. i wish there were some concerts coming up this month to go to. i don't know what there is to do for a date without a car. especially since we are not the party types. twenty minutes is ridiculous. it has only been 6 right now, and i am spent. oh well, glad to get this done with. i have a feeling the studying and assignments and what not are going to be piling up soon. is that how you spell piling? doesn't really look right, but whatever. i'm kind of curious what the next page says about what i have writen. i should finish my reading today, that should only take a little while. here comes my favorite song on the cd. i wonder if they will release it to the radio. i bet the next page says something about if you don't capitalize your words correctly, you are this type of person. this email writing and aol instant messenger has left me with some bad habits. oh well, no big deal. i don't really the red hot chili peppers that much. kind of too much funk in their music for me. it sounds good, but their lyrics are a little shaky. i'm really glad i got these headphones though. i hope calculus tests aren't that hard. the ta seems really nice, and hopefully he will know what is going to be on the test. i still don't think the teacher knows what he is doing. we're up to  11 minutes. not bad. lisa. can't believe how this is working out. i wish i remembered more about her from elementary school. i'm kind of worried about her being smarter than me. it shouldn't be a problem, i guess i'm not used to it. makes me think i have to act smarter around her. not smarter but smart. she doesn't get in to that intellectual stuff that much. kind of crazy, i think about this girl like i have known her for a long time, and also that we are dating. i think what i said constitutes as a date proposal. we'll see pretty soon i guess. i don't like how i say i guess all the time. it's in my im's all the time. got to mix it up a little bit. 5 more minutes to go. i wonder how long the average one of these is. 500 kids in one class is huge. there were at least 6 people from my high school in there. god this is getting lame. the writing lady went to northwestern. kind of cool my best friend is going there for journalism. much better than arizona state or wherever economics lady is from. wonder where pennebaker went to school. can't tell from looking at him, had to be in the east though. probably isn't the best plan to do this while listening to music. kind of affects your thoughts alot. especially rhcp, they say some messed up stuff. the new cd is good though. they have kind of mellowed out. i wonder if i will see them when they tour. kind of an expensive ticket. but it would be cool to say that i've seen them. well looks like we are ending   "
Tell me about yourself.,"Wow! This has been a crazy day! I am really overwhelmed by everything. I'm sitting in my dormroom right now and and all I can't think about is last night. I'm still really really mad. All of these rude girls were running down the hall at 3:00 in the morning, screaming, yelling,and slamming doors. I got only a few hours of sleep. This really sucks especially since I came home early from Waco just so I could sleep. I could have spent the night there and hung out with Grant, my boyfriend if i had known that i would be kept up that late. Oh yeah, I really miss Grant right now! He's supposed to call me today when he gets out of class, which was about, uh, two hours ago. I could just call him but first of all, i am typing this right now and can't stop for about 14 more minutes, and second, i am trying that stupid oldfashioned stuff where you let the guy call you. The tv is on in here and i kind of want to change the channel because they are talking about Sept. 11th. That's so depressing and I think that I am depressed enough right now with all of this new stuff in my life. I liked my house and my room in my house and my town where i knew my way around and my tutoring job that payed well, and my cozy school where I have gone since kindergarten. I miss my mom and dad, and friends, but most of all I miss my dog! DID I TELL YOU THAT I MISS MY DOG, MOLLY? She is the one who undepresses me. How can you be upset when she is begging for your approval and looking at you with that puppy dog face that is that is the ultimate model of pure love. Oh yeah- I just heard something about American Idol, that t. v. show. THe girl who won, Kelly Clarkson, is from Burleson, a small towm outside of Fort Worth. That is where my boyfriend is from, which just brings me back to the fact that I miss Grant right now. Now all i can think about is the fact that I am such a typical girl; all i can think about is my boyfriend! oh well, it's better tan thinking about the mean girls that i have to live with. They are so unthoughtful. My brother told me to live here and that i would meet some of my best friends for life here. Yeah right! I hate all of these girls. All of my friends live somewhere else. I pretty much always take his advise because he is really smart and after all, he is my big brother. But i think he was wron on this one. I guess I am finished. Yeah, i better get ready for dinner, but this is pretty addicting to write all of this down, even though none of this make any sense to you. Oh well, bye bye. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     I just ate at Miltos with my dad. Why is it that I feel like crying everytime I see him but I could care less about seeing my mom?  I guess I've always been a daddy's girl. I am waiting for my roommate, she's kind of helpless. Actually shes extremely helpless. I try to be understanding but shes clueless sometimes. Like hooking her computer up, maybe since my dad works for IBM I have an advantage over other computer-illiterate people but really- red cord matches with red slot, green with green, etc. I feel like I have to take her everywhere with me. For instance, the reason I am waiting on her is because I'm going to my boyfriends house and she wants to come with me. I wouldn't mind except that I don't get to see Ian (boyfriend) very often and when I do she wants to come with me. I feel bad for her, I mean in that she has no car to get around and I do but still I guess I am selfish like that. I am desperate to know why I sometimes want to shot Ian- part of me loves him deeply and the other part wants to shake some sense into him. I guess I should just listen to my brother when he tells me Ian's not the one and I shouldn't stress over it. I know Ian's not Mr. Right but he sure is Mr. Right Now and thats fun too!  He's just super inconsiderate. We went to the same high school outside of Austin at Lake Travis, its a 30 minute drive and he NEVER comes to see me, I always have to go see him. Thats not to say he doesnt tell me hes going to come out. He always says   sure baby I'll come see you tonight   but never follows through. I don't like dating Ian that much I am just paranoid of being alone I guess. (plus TA in psychology class is kind of cute. )  I HATE the singles scene. I wonder why that is, I come from a stable family environment- my parents have been happily married for 20 years yet I find myself falling so hard for every guy I date!  Its pathetic. I think that I crave positive attention. See I was always the ugly duckling in middle and early high school, then out of the blue, my junior year, guys started wanting to date me, it was a total shock to me. I guess I grew into my fat cheeks. I desperately seek someone who will tell me I'm beautiful even if I'm not the perfect blonde hair, blue eyed, tan, sorority girl. I often feel as though I was born in the wrong generation. I am so into doing things for yourself and not for others, yet I care deeply about our environment and the human race. I listen to bands who were inspired by the Grateful Dead, and the only time I truly feel like I fit in is when I am at a Widespread Panic or String Cheese concert surrounded by a ton of free-spirits. Everyone is so loving and accepting at those events (partly because they are on so many drugs they don't know the difference but also because they were like me, they were the ones who got teased in middle school. It took me a long time to stop caring what other people think about me. I mean, I take care of myself, I bathe and everything, and I take pride in my own appearance yet I don't let anyone elses opinions guide my decisions. Wow stream of conciousness writing is hurting my fingers. If I get carpal tundral syndrome I know who to blame, pennebaker!  Eh I suppose if I was going to get it I would have gotten it a long time ago. I am stuffed. Really wonder if purging isnt so bad after all. Well I think I will save that for when I don't have stiches in my mouth. I just got my wisdom teeth removed. hurt like hell. Actually it hurt worse when they were growing in, the first week of college.  "
Tell me about yourself.,"     Well here I am sitting down prepared to type for twenty minutes. The first thing that comes into my mind is how slow I type and it is not any easier typing on a laptop. I wish my regular computer waS WORKING. OOPS I JUST PUSHED THE CAPS LOCK BUTTON. thats better. I also can't help but think how hungry I am. Maybe I should go down to the cafateria and get a quick byte. Than again I could just make something real quick that taste much better. geez this bracelet doesn't make it easier to type either. thats better. Maybe if I move the laptop onto my lap. eh. . somewhat better. My girlfriend should be comming back soon. I am glad she joined a sorority. it gives me some space. I wish she would understand that I need my space. oh well that will just be an ongoing argument between the two of us. there goes my stomach again. My suitmate should be leaving soon for a fraternity event. To bad erik's parents wouldn't let him join a fraternity. this song is catchy. but it is played out. I am so mad about my car. I don't understand how a brand new car won't start. At least I got it into the shop quick. I hope I get it back tomorrow. Linkin Park's new cd is so amazing. I wish jennifer didn't give me such a hard time about putting it on. I think I will listen to it aftter I finish typing. I am half way through. This assignment is pretty cool. I never realized how much I could write in twenty minutes. my psychology class is huge. I wonder how many people are in it. It has got to be at least 400 kids. It is so different seeing a teacher standing infront of all those kids. they even have a microphone. Those huge projectors that are built into the wall are so awesome too. I hate commercials. . I wonder when I will get to use my checks for the first time. I have never had to use a check before. I think I will like going to UT. Its only been a week and a half and I love it. It is so stressful living at home. Always having to do somehting. I know that my parents do everything for me, but they always keep me busy. I wonder what I can eat. I wonder how long I can last without eating. Maybe Jennifer will get back soon and make me a great meal. She is so good to me. I really do Love her. I hope my dad gets me those Incubus tickets. I really want to go. Eminem is always on the radio. . I wonder what he was talking about at the vma's the other night. Something about punching a guy with glasses. I wonder if evereybody thinks the way I do. I know that my mind is really weird. I don't even understand my self sometimes. I jump from thought to thought so quickly. I hope I learn something about myself in psychology. I wonder is college is going to be hard. Well I only have two minutes left I think I should see what other homework I might have. 30 seconds left and all I can think about is eating. 9. 8. 7. 6. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1. . "

Tell me about yourself.,"     Today is 911 and it has been a whole year since the tragedy last year. I remember that day being in first period and hearing of a plane flying into the tower. Obviously, that was all the people at school talked about that day, and the shock was great. It surprised me so much that my teachers didn't take out time from classwork to talk about the event. This is the biggest most memorable event of our lives and i thought it deserved more. so much more than just the acknowledgement. Yeah, the principal came on, but it didn't seem like enought. I would have liked to discuss it with my class. Actually, yesterday in my rhetoric class this guy in my class made this annoying comment that he thinks the president took advantage of what happened on 911 to ask the nation for volunteers. I was outraged at what he said, how can you be so stupid (to put it bluntly). . that isn't very nice for me to think but our nation is in a time of need and this past year was a very unique time. The president totally has the right to ask for volunteers and was in no way taking advantage of 911. It bothers me when people speak about that things when they should take more time to think about what they're really saying. . . yeah, so anyways. 911, everytime i hear one of those songs about the event it gives me chills up and down my body, the chills are uncontrolable and it makes me feel good though that it happens. I always get chills when i really really enjoy or care mostly about what i'm seeing or hearing. That is so interesting how the body works that way. I don't think about getting chills but they just start running up and down my body. Although, i get chills i don't usually cry. I'm not a very emotional person, but all depends on what's going on around me. Lately I have been pretty stressed out from the this huge change in living, change in schedule. And, I can cry easier probably because I've been so stressed. I find time to take it away, like when i run, i am not stressed. i could think about all i have to do while i'm running but the thing is i'm not stressed while i'm running because i know i need to run and i can't study while i run so it doesn't stress me out. Does that make any sense in the way i wrote it. In other words, if i was watching tv, and i know i have to study, then i would be stressed because i know i could be studying instead of watching tv. I am very good at managing my time so i know that i will be able to accustom myself and get used to my schedule better. I've just been so used to my routine at home that it is hard to change here. What doesn't help me very much is that i have late classes, no earlier than 11a. m. and the other three days are at 1pm. Therefore, I usually sleep until classes where if i had 9 or 10 am classes i would be up earlier and more time to study during the day. I like to get my homework and what i need to get done out of the way. . . i don't usually find myself as a procrastinator. I've definitely learned my conservative ways from my father and probably picked up most of those traits from him. although i'm not as simplistic as he is. Everything to him is simple. simple. period. it bugs me sometimes how simple everything has to be but i've picked up on some of those things because i see myself doing the same things he does. and it bothers me when people are too loose. I like to clean, organized, in order and when people i know are late and too loose about what they do it irritates me. yes well, i was just thinking about this song i was listening to today called   make yourself   it has great lyrics and you can probably tell from the title what its about: not to let other people influence your ways maybe in the sense of copying them but do what you want to do and feel. make yourself. And, there is another song that addresses t  "
Tell me about yourself.,"As I sit here in front of my laptop, visions of the past 3 weeks of school flash through my mind. It has been a crazy, eventful, and stressful beginning to my college career. UT is the perfect place for me. The diversity of the students, the quality of the education, and the variety of extracurricular activities available are some of the many reasons that I chose to come here. Although I am completely content with my classes, my roomates, and my social life, today has been rough. Today, one year after 9/11/01, there have been strong feelings of sadness surrounding my thoughts. I cried this morning while watching the news, and again tonight at the ceremony at the tower. How will the families of the victims ever heal? My family experienced an unexpected death 2 years ago, and I know my Mom still cries at night. That sick, depressed feeling will forever haunt thouasands of people that were affected by the tradgedy on September 11. I cannot even contemplate their pain. I saw the different reactions of students tonight on the main lawn, and I know this tradegy affected people in different ways. Well, September 11 is a day that I will always remember and the families of the victims will always be in my prayers. However, in my religion, the one year anniversary of someone's death is observed and signified as a time for closure. It is my hope that on this one year anniversary, the United States will accept closure, but continue to express the pride and patriotism that we have been so boldly expressing throughout the year.  "
Tell me about yourself.,"     I cannot wait to go and see Emily this weekend. Nanny is coming into town; I love that woman. She is a great person, an amazing person. It has been awhile since I have seen her. I wouldn't mind not going to the OU game. It would be SO nice to have this place to myself without anyone else ere for a weekend. even if there ws nothing to do. I could catch up on  reading and homework or get ahead. But then again Lne said that most people would die to go to the OU game and that I should accept the offers I receive. I rejected the first. The second one is someone who I just met last night. and I want to attend the game and this is the best way because tickets are so hard to get. But I have to stay in a hotel room with this guy. I guess I will just say I have a boyfriend. Speaking of. I like Chad. He is very nice looking, very polite. He did everything right. I wonder if he likes me? I wonder if he will call today. only time will tell. I hate Michael for what he did to me. No I hate what he did, I don't hate him. I don't hate anybody. Jenny and Emily have become two of my best friends. I talk to each of them several times a day. The weird thing is, they have been friends for 7 years. And now, over some guy, Emily hates Jenny. Emily has done the same thing to me that Jenny has done to Emily. I do not really feel sorry for her. It feels weird that although they do not speak to each other, I speak to each of them many times each day and usually the other is not mentioned, and I dare not bring up the other, I do not want to stir things up or be in the middle of it. So I am going to see Jeff this weekend when I visit Emily. I know he will want me to stay the night with him. But so will Emily. I wonder if she would care. I don't want to do anything with him. It is just hard to put out old flames. We cannot start anything again. I just got a computer a few days ago and now it is not working! I am taking it home tonight to have someone work on it. Sam is always in our dorm room. Last night everyone and their dog were in my dorm. I have 8 AM class Mon through thursday. I could not get to sleep until 2AM. Then I turned off the two larms I set and my neighbor called tomake sure I was up at around 7:40. Yikes. I hopped out of bed, brushed my teeth and ran out of my room. I want to see a movie. That is what I feel like doing today. right now. Maybe a nice sappy movie with lots of sweet romance-not corny though. Or a thriller or scary movie. but I only like to see that with a guy. Hmm. Or one with Vin Diesel. Now Vin is definitely not usually my type, but after seeing Fast and the Furious and XXX, he definitely does it for me. He has such a sexy voive and attitude. Usually I do not like guys that built. I need someone more my size. He is the exception. All 18 year old boys are assholes. I have not founf the exception to that rule. I will not even give one the time of day or a chance. I don't have time for that. But I think Chad has already been through his stage. I think this one is worse than the terrible two's. I need to call Holly. But I am afraid to tell her something I did with Michael. I do not want her to pray for me or look down upon me. No she won't look down for me, but her heart will heart for me. But I am not really in the wrong direction. I pray. I know what is right and wrong. But no one is perfect. I also need to call my sister-I wonder how Chad and Kaycee are doing. Those kids are absolutely rotten. I hope they grow out of it. It is just that they are beautiful and Kaycee is so cute that nobody ever can remain angry with her. I hope that they are beautiful in high school and i know they will be-not just because they are my nephew and neice, their mother is beautiful. But I hope that they are not the snobby kids. or the rude kids. I hope they are humble and compassionate. High school kids do too much damage to other high school kids. It's awful. I wish that highschoolers could lern to look at things on the grand scale. I wish they could think more term and not so much about the situation. Realize that it doesn't matter in callege. No one knows nything about you. It is a new start.  "
Tell me about yourself.,"     Today has been such a long day. I am not a big fan of tuesdays. Physics makes me feel so stupid. I feel like everybody else knows exactly what he is talking about in that class except for me. This is kind of weird writing to a computer about my thoughts, kind of like an online journal. I really need to start writing in my actual journal every night. I did last year, but ever since I got here, I just haven't made the time everynight. Kristen and I have been getting along great. I think we are going to be great roomates. I've been thinking a lot about me and Patrick a lot lately. I'm not sure if I can handle another 2 years of him living in Dallas and me in Austin. I know we've done it since March, but I think it is getting harder. I wish I knew how to type. I think my entry is going to be 1/3 the length of Kristen's, but I guess it doesn't really matter. Man I've got so much to do tonight. I need to read for psychology, interior, art history, and figure out my physics homework before Thursday. My mom and I have been getting along really well lately. I think we are going to be much better friends now that we don't live under the same roof. I'm not sure when I'm going to be able to go see my grandparents. Gosh, I haven't seen them in forever. Maybe i should go somewhere to study tonight instead of trying to study in my room. I never feel like I accomplish very much in here. What really stinks is I can't read my art history anywhere else but in the room. those stupid reserves just won't print out right. I guess I could try that adobe business that girl was talking about during class. I'm not sure if I'll have to buy that or iff my dad could just put it on my computer off what we have at home. I can't wait to watch Friends later. It's been fun lately because they've been playing a season that I've never seen. It's always the small things that make me the happiest. Oh no, the phone is ringing. i guess the will just have to wait for 3 more minutes. It was probably Kristen at the grocery store. I'll just call her back in a second. i'm glad tommorrow isn't as jam packed as tuesdays. I couldn't take two in a row. Now my cell phone is ringing, what's up?  "
Tell me about yourself.,"I just came back to my dorm from Hobby Lobby. I went there with my friends Lauren and Rachel to get crafts and other supplies for our Nothing Books. Nothing Books are like scrapbooks, and we have to make them for our sorority, Alpha Epsilon Phi. I think it's a really cute way of making sure we remember our pledge term. Rush week was maybe the most hectic week of my entire life. First of all, we got to Austin on move-in day, and we spent all day, I mean all day long moving into University Towers. It was crazy! We took a break to eat lunch, but the day was insane. Everyone moving in with their boxes and crates, and the move-in equipment that was supplied was hardly efficient. So that night, we started rush, after all that mess. I was so tired and worn out, I could barely walk to the meeting. The rest of that night is kind of a blur; I think I came back to Towers after the meeting and went straight to bed. The rest of the week we had to dress up. The events got more and more dressy each day, and I could swear that the weather got hotter and hotter each day. I think I probably sweat more in those 5 days than I ever have. ever! It was honestly just gross. Really, the whole process of Sorority Rush at this university is ridiculous. I guess I am being a hypocrite, but when you think about it, some sororities will cut you without even getting to know you at all. You think they like you, and they're cheering in your face like they love you, saying all kinds of things, like   we hope to see you tomorrow  , and the next thing you know, they've cut you. I guess I am making it sound like it's an awful experience, when in reality it really wasn't so bad. There were some very entertaining events during rush. My favorite was probably Skit Night, where we were allowed to go back to a maximum of five houses, and at each house they performed their own unique skit to try to get us to come back to their house the next night for Pref Night. Pref Night was probably the most emotional night of the whole week. All of the seniors in the sororities were crying, either because they were excited to get new members the next day, or because they were sad to be leaving. It could have been a combination of both. Immediately after we went to our last three houses that night, we were on complete   silence  . We could not speak to anyone, not our friends, our families, not even people that weren't rushing. It was supposed to be our chance to think about the entire week and to make a decision based on only our personal feelings as to which sorority we wanted to be in. We went back to our group meeting areas for the last time, and we ranked our choices. It was not very hard for me, because I pretty much knew which one I wanted to be in. However, there were tons of girls crying that night, torn over what they should do. I am just glad I was not in that position. That next day was Bid Day, where everyone found out what sorority they actually got into. There was even more crying that day. All around me, girls were screaming and crying, because some of them hadn't gotten into their first choice sorority, and some were just so happy with their bids that they couldn't contain themselves I guess. It was crazy! I was very happy, and when I got out of the building and saw that all of my friends had also been put into my sorority, I was even more ecstatic. Our pledge class is made up of 62 diverse girls who each contribute something different to the sorority. I know I am going to love being in Alpha Epsilon Phi. What I don't know is how I am ever going to balance being in a sorority, making good grades in my Communications, Chemistry, Psychology, and Hebrew classes, and partying at this extremely social school. Not to say that I am a real party girl, but I like to go to all the events, and it gets very difficult to stay on track with everything coming at you from different directions all at once. I am glad that I live at Towers with almost all of my friends, because it gives me a chance to not only be with all of them, but also to meet new people. I didn't know my roommate before I came here, and I have met so many people on my hall, or at different sorority and fraternity parties. I like everyone I meet, but I guess at a school with 50,000 students you can't go wrong. I know I made the right choice by going to the University of Texas at Austin. It has everything I could want in a college and more. I love it here!! And I especially love my styrofoam orange longhorn ears that I got at the co-op when I was visiting during orientation. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     Well, the biggest thing that I have been thinking about is of course, my boyfriend!  He is in San Antonio, and I miss him so much!  I was fortunate enough to see him the past two weekends. This last weekend I got to see him play in his first college football game at Trinity!  It was really exciting, but it stunk because unlike in high school, I wasn't on the track cheering for him. I was also super happy because I have been able to see my family. I am such a nerd, because I miss my mom so much!  She has always been there for me, so it is actually kind of hard to make my own decisions. But it is also good, cause it is definitely time for me to grow up!  My brother came in town for the first time in several months and I did not get to see him, but it didn't bother me, because I know he didn't miss me. He was away for the Navy, and I wrote him a letter, and he never wrote me back. He has put my family through so much crap, that I don't know when I am going to be strong enough to see him. Thank god the rest of my family is so caring and sane!  Life goes on, and he will soon realize how important his family really is, especially after all we have done for him. At first, I was extremely nervous about school and Sorority rush, but now everything is getting better. I was so glad when I became a Zeta because that is what I wanted from the start. It was just kind of hard because when we were practicing for Phi Psi field day, they tried to put me up in a stunt, and made me feel soooo fat. I am already so self conscious about my weight, so it really hurt me. I really don't want to have an eating disorder, especially after a movie being made about my aunt and her failure as an Olympic athlete because of balimia. Well, now after almost eight minutes, my arm hurts so much, and all i am wondering is when this is going to be over with!!!  I also hope that my studies turn out ok because I really have to study to get good grades, like REALLY!  I am just not smart like everyone else, or at least that is how I feel. I mean I like all my professors except for Pre-Cal, which really pisses me off because I took pre-cal and calculus in high school and aced them both. but this adjunct teacher does not teach at all. He goes over the basic formulas, which I have known since like eighth grade, and then gives us the most difficult homework, which he has not given any examples for or ways to understand in class. He also words the problems in the most bizarre ways. All the students are so confused, and it makes me feel so stupid, because it is just Pre-Cal!  So, today I went to the University of Texas Learning Center, and it really seemed to help. I think out of my class of thirty, there was three of us at that moment in there. So that already says enough about our teacher. Also, I emailed him about it, and he made me feel even stupider. I mean if he wants respect from me, then he needs to respect me!  He told me he couldn't pat my hand to make me feel better, etc. , and I was like, yeah, but you could try and teach us, instead of going over 8th grade algebra!!!  But oh well, I am trying to fix everything!  I just decided that I am going to be on top of all my studies, and try to keep up on the reading and all my math homework. I hope that I never forget about any important tests, or assignments, or papers. I am super glad I am in a FIG, because hopefully that will help. I am just super horrible with tests, because I have a major test anxiety. That would explain my horrible SAT score. But whatever, it is all good, I mean look, I made it to UT, didn't I~!  Well, since psychology is my major I hope this class keeps me super interested so I don't switch majors like five times, like every other college student!  I just want to know what I want to do with my life, besides marry my sweetie, and be successfull with my family and money. But, so far, I am so glad I have chosen UT, because I absolutely love it, and even though there have already been those times when I have felt so fat, or so overloaded with sorority stuff or reading( which I am also very slow at!), i know everything in the end will turn out just how it is supposed to, because God is here carrying me through out all my good times and my bad!  I just hope I can figure out this pretesting thing, because that would be awesome if I didn't have to do five hours worth of experiments, ya know!! "
Tell me about yourself.,"     i'm thinking about how if i do this all the way through, i'll be late   in meeting my girlfriend because i still have to shower and change.  my clothes are in the dryer, getting wrinkle free because i'm too lazy   to iron them. i'm thinking about last night and how leah and ia have   been having some weird moments lately, but i think that i can   attribute them mostly to stress. yesterday in dr. boetcher's office, she   mentioned dana and him being the one that leah was dating. cat's   out of the bag. i know, of course, and i've known for a while, but still   to hear someone else say it. i wonder why she never told me right   out that dana was her ex? its not like i'm stupid and i wouldn't put it   together. alicia is IMing me. . i haven't talke to her in a while. i   wonder how her friend fran is. she was cute. alicia says that she's   well and that NT hasn't changed. i don't miss it. or denton, really,   which makes me wonder why i'm going back there this weekend to   visit. i guess i just miss the people, but somehow i suspect that it   will be weird to see them. to be so removed from them for months,   it will all feel alien to me. i can't imagine myself there anymore. and   teaching today. . ugh. i'm not really looking forward to it. i'm afraid that   i won't remember my shit, that i won't be able to help these kids,   which is what i'm getting paid to do. its kind of silly to worry though,   after being surrounded by math and science for the past two years, i   hope that i'll remember something. and i'm hungry. it weird seeing   tamsters around school. its almost like they shouldn't be here. like   when you see random people in a dream that creep you out   because they don't seem like they should be allowed to invade your   mind. i'm not used to all this reading in school. i wish i had a   snickers. i'm used to math homework and bs like that, not actually   having to read and digest stuff like that. i like it, just not used to it. i   need to shower. i'm worried that i won't be able to finish this. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     I thnik that after this I'll do my chemistry homework and get it out the way. It will probably take me forever eventhough it's only 10 questions because I still need to read. My Incubius CD is ending. I need to ask Christina to start it again. I am wonder how I'm going to really learn how to speak Latin. I know I'll be able to read and Write it. When is my computer going to come in?  I feel like I'm intruding on Christina everytime I use her lap top. I'm drawing a blank. Get up Tina. I'm never good at this stream of thought stuff cause I'm always thinking about the stream of thought like in english class last year when Mrs. Posern asked us to do it for. . I guess it was ten minutes. I miss her. I miss Clinton and Pakey. I wonder what Pakey's doing right now. Probably out somewhere in Houston. I love this song. I really want to play guitar. I hope I make the band next year. That dream was wierd last night or this morning or something like that. Singing would be so often for a living. I've always liked being on the go constantly. I'm so organized and yet never organized enough. I wanna' here my song again. That's so wierd, when one song is on you can't think of another on. Those girls next door were really loud earlier today. What were they doing?  I don't dress up very much. I still don't understand how people can where heels to an amusement park. Six Flags was fun this summer. I love this song. I'd love to see them live. I wonder what there like in person. He has such an amazing voice.  I wonder how my voice would improve if I were to take lessons. I need to exercise more. That would definitly improve my lung capcity and my playing. I'm so upset I didn't make the band. I'm proud of myself though because I sightread music while everyone else had had their music for a whie. What am I going to play next year for an audition. I don't know. I need to practice again. Is my music here?  I need to send the pool key to my mom. I also need to find a church before my mom kills me. I want to go see My Big Fat Greek Wedding. Maybe we'll go sometime this week. I don't know. How much time left. Okay. Um. I did a really. times up. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     oh my gosh, my body hrts so bad. every time i move its like my muscles are tearing, crying out for me to stop. man, im hungry too. can't wait for kaye to get done with her class so we can go eat. i don't know how much good that is cause i don't like the food in the cafeteria anyway. oh well. the sun is so bright today- wlking around campus was really hot, but when there was a breeze, it was definitely nice. i saw some really cute squirrels out by the water fountain, and i wish i could have stopped to watch them, but i had to get to class on time. man, try outs are so hard. i don't kow if i can keep up with teveryone else for the next few weeks. it will be hard. especially now, until we get to start rowing. then i know i can show people up and do my best. classes are getting harder. there is always reading, reading, reading. it nevere ends. some of it i love while some of it drags so much when i try to read it. math is surprisingly understandable, so i feel confidnet that i will do well in that class. oh, im nervous about tryouts. i bet kate won't continue with them, she seemed to not be doing as well last night with the body circuits. i will push her a lot today at practice. mabey that will motivate her to keep working hard. so hungry!  only 1 hor until i can eat. i miss emma, more than everyone else in my family. she is always so funny, and cute. i know she is doing well in her school but i want to be there to see her and talk to her about it. can't wait to go home and see everyone. my parents seem so happy about me rowing. this reminds them of crosscountry. i miss anne and hallie too. everything beautiful is far away. the yellow flowers stephanie gave me are beautiful. i love them so much. my room feels more homey now, and yellow brightens it up a lot. i don't know what to do about simon. he frustrates me a lot, wether i show it or not. guess ill just try not to think bout it for awhile, and see what happens. no use in thinkng about it, it only makes me upset. matisse's art work is so beautiful. . i can't wait til we talk about him in art history. the figures he cuts out catch my attention so much. why did ross call last night so late. woke me up, couldnt go back to sleep. ended up oversleeping for 8 am class. but test went ok, glad i studies yesterday and did not wait until this morning to tackle the job. would have regretted that a lot, and done poorly on the test. i want to find some new music to listen to. something that is not mellow, omething with energy. ohhhh. im so sore it hurts to type. my family looks so happy in this picture. awwww. everyone is smiling so genuinely, its not one of those posed pics where everyone is forcinf a smile, ot just smiling for the sake of the camera. only one more class left today. and then its the weekend. will be nice to relax. have to get through running tonight, but i don't mind that, kind of looking forward o it. get to see the boats for the first time too. i hope kates mom is doing ok, i havent seen her in so long. i should tell my mom to go visit her, they gt along well. i like it when our renst hang out together, esp our dads. joey is so funny. i didnt realize how great of a person i had right under my nose for so long until he left. i hope he comes home from germany and doesnt like it too much out there, even though that is selfish to think. we all miss him too much- his upbeat personality and sincerity towards life. hope he comes home for christmas, or sometime soon. this weekend is goign to be busy, i should make a to do list so i can get all my homework done. the week days are so busy its hard to get everything done by the dead lines. i hope my mom sends me a letter from emma soon. she said she made me someting last tie i talked to her on the phone. my dorm is annoying me again, they want everyone to be so involved with everyone else, going to movies together, and eating dinner together all the time. i don't like it at all. i think i can only really push myself to be social and meet new people for the imes that i am out on campus. and when i come home to my dorm, i want to be by myself, not cnstantly hanging out with other people. i feel bad to an extent, because i know the ras put a lot of time into organizing that kind of stuff. but that is just not sometihg i am interested. 5 hours until practice time again. ohhhh. but then i have the whole weekend to relax. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Today is September 11th. It's kind of strange. Everyone is hurring to get to parades and festivities to remember this significant tragic event. Where am I?  I am in a friend's dorm doing a writing assignment for professor Pennebaker. This is kind of hard because I have no idea what else to write. September 11th is just the number one thing on many people's mind right now, since it is 9/11. I really don't know how to feel. I'm saddened of course, but a little tired of all the   ground zero   footage. It it's so sad, why do they keep airing it over and over and over and over again?  It makes me more sad to watch it. I haven't been able to watch T. V. all afternoon because of it. I don't know what else to write. I wonder how i'm going to get this stain off of my white star wars T-shirt. I was trying to unwrap a passion fruit starburst with my mouth only, and it sliped out of my mouth. Weird. My roomate and I tried to see who could unwrap it the fasted. It was sort of a tie, because neither of use could get the wrapper off. I wonder if they lit the tower up yet. It's supposed to be red, white and blue tonight. My foot kind of itches from a mosquito bite i recieved earlier today. I need to put something cold on it. I don't like Britney Spears too much. Her music is kind of weak. She has nice shoes though. I guess she couldn't be all that bad since millions of people mindlessly buy her records and posters like my friend who has it religiously taged up on his wall. He, like every other teenage boy ranging from the ages 13-18 adores her. She's not that bad. Oh man, I've only been typing for nine minutes and 14 seconds and I can't think of anything else to write. This is the longest 20 minutes of my life. We used to free write like this in a rhetoric class I was taking at my highschool. I was taking it for dual credit with a local university. We used to write for 10 minutes strait without stopping. My teacher was a nice 50 year old woman who sounded like a 90 year old. Her voice was so soothing, sometimes. I hear this whisling or hissing sound coming from the bathroom down the hall and a couple of guys laughing outside the door. I can't stop writing. Let's see, what to write about. I think I'll write about my day. Today I was late for Chemistry. again. Our teacher is this French woman who has the thickest accent. She's sweet though. After that I headed back to Jester West to grab a Freshen's smoothie. I got strawberry shooter. It was pretty good. A little icy. This guy behind me asked what i recomended, and I said the pina colider or the the passion fruit. I like passion fruit, but not as much as I like pineapple. I didn't really enjoy the strawberry shooter because it had to many seeds in it. After that i headed to my History of Rock and Roll class. I love that class. All we do really is read and listen to blues, jazz and Tin Pan Alley music. It's really fun. I came home at about 1:00 from class and fell right asleep, them watched queen of the damned. That movie has a good sound track to it. Some of the songs that were in the movie were not in the sound track. That was weird. Wow,only three minutes to go. It kind of seemed interminable at the beginning, but now it's not that hard. I guess it's easier to just think rather than to think about what you're thinking. What is that called?  Oh, yeah. metacognition. I learned that in my rhetoric class also. THinking about your thinking. Only 30seconds left. I guess I'll write my name for the remaining time. Wait there is no time.      "
Tell me about yourself.,"Ok rigt now Iam a little unsure of what exactly I should be writing. I am trying to concentrate on this assignment while my roomate is getting ready to leave. The only thing I can hear is the soungd of her opening drawers, people talking in the hall, and the refridgerator sound. Before i started writting this I just finished my last class of the week and now it is offically the weekend. Suddenly I feel the stress of the week almost evaporating from me. Even though I know the weekend will be packed and probably just as stressful it seems easier. Right now my room is very cold. After I finish this assignment I will be packing for a retreat and calling my parents to speak to them before I leave. The fact that I will be on Lake Travis all day tomarrow excites me. Austin is georgous and I can't wait to see the Lake. My roomate just left the room. She went to play racketball with her friends. My roomate and I get along very well and for that I am very grateful. It would be hard to live the whole year with someone you did not like. I actually like my whole hall I live in Jester East on the 9th floor. The girls in my hall are all fun and we seem to hang out with each other. Eww I hope Casey locked the door when she left because a stocker has been spotted on my floor. I've talked to a few girl who said they have had encounters with him. They said he knocked on their door and asked if he could hang out with them while he waites on his friend. There are pictures up on the walls of him everywhere saying to not approach him if they see him. Last night the police were outside of our dorm and I think it was because of him. My hand is starting to hurt. Yesterday I feel flat on my face and scraped up my hand. It was actually kind of funny. My friend and I were racing to get in line for OU tickets and i triped and slid to the ground with only my hands stopping my face from hitting it. Everyone standing in line saw me. Yesterday was also my brother's birthday. He turned 20! -which seems crazy to me. 20 seems so much older than 19. It's crazy how time flies so fast. I can remember when me and my brother were young and just played all day. I wish I could have seen him yesterday but I had class and he's at Southwest. Since were only 30 minutes away it seems like we've grown closer.         "
Tell me about yourself.,"     ok im sitting on my bed. i kind of wish i was at home on my bed. i like my new room a lot, and i like my new bed a lot but i miss home. i am not sad here but i just miss my old way of life and my old setting. i wish i could go back to elementary school. those were the good old days. i love my old neighborhood. i definitely want to send my kids to my elementary school. i miss the scots football games the most. i have been going to them since 5th grade, maybe? i love the atmosphere. everyone is happy and excited it is friday and you get to talk to everyone and its so fun! i like watching my friends play football and the feeling after we won. after i made belles, the scots games became even more fun. i can't explain that feeling, waiting to line up and dance on the field. you are so nervous and anxious and shaking. then the lieutenants bow and you scream for them and then the music starts. we strut out and its such an out-of-body experience. you are standing before thousands of people, and you are smiling so big and bright. not because you have to, but because you want to and you can't help it. i don't think its possible to not smile. then you get ready to dance. and you start dancing and its the best feeling in the world. you feel so weird. and you don't want to mess up. and when the music stops you are so proud. of yourself and of your team. and you stand up and strut out towards the crowd and all the fans are standing and cheering and clapping and smiling and you can't help but smile too. because all the parents are truly amazed. and all the little girls, the little girls that you used to be, are staring at you in awe. they want to be you so badly. because everyone in the community looks up to you. and you represent so much positive energy in the community. and the little boys want your autograph. and they want to date you when they're in high school. you feel like a celebrity. its your moment to shine. your fifteen minutes of fame. its ineffable. i can't describe the feeling, but its the best. i miss those days so much. i would give anything to go back to that. but i cant, and thats what kills me. i can't wait to go back to the scots game in a few weeks. it will be so weird to see my younger friends dancing. to my favorite dance ever. to my first dance on the field. it was the best dance anyone had seen. and the sad thing is, i won't be a part of it. it will be one of those bittersweet moments. i love those moments. i live for those moments. they make you so happy and so sad at the same time. it makes me so happy to reminisce in my favorite days. i don't know how i will feel when i go back to that stadium because it will be so different. most of my friends will be gone. i like my new lifestyle in college. its fine. but i loved what i had. i don't like getting older. im fine with where i was. i feel like my life is going by so fast. i feel like my best days are behind me. i can't believe how fast high school went by. if i could, i would go back and do it all over again. exactly the same way. i would make the same mistakes and everything. just to relive those incredible four years. they werent always fun, but it was a good experience. instead of reliving them, i would like to just watch it all on video. watch everything I've ever done. i miss camp too. i learned everything about life at camp. it makes me so sad to think im not a camper anymore. thats how i know im old. thats how i know my life is going by so fast. camp is pure happiness. all of my favorite things in life are behind me and i don't know what to do about it. i am really enjoying school here. like the classes itself are so interesting and im really enjoying them. but the work is becoming overwhelming. and i don't like   going out   at night. i don't like socializing with superficial people. i feel surrounded by sin. by people who only care about being cool or something. i just love the days when everyone was innocent. and it didnt matter what you did on the weekend. it didnt matter who your friends were as long as you were happy with them. everyone was nice. and on friday nights we would eat dinner at jacks and then go to the scots game. when everything was perfect. and you didnt worry about anything. seriously, stress wasnt an issue. school work was nothing because it was so easy. everything was done for you. you went to soccer practice and you went to school. that was it. it was so simple. did i realize that then? did i thoroughly enjoy it while i was there? or do i just love it looking back on it? i don't know why i like living in the past. but i enjoy dwelling in it. it makes me happy and sad at the same time. my best friend is the same way. she is the best person i know. i don't know how i will survive the next four years without her physically by my side everyday. she is the only person that fully understands me because she is me. she feels the same way. and how many times have we talked about these good old days? the elementary school that we loved so much and the scots games that were the highlight of our weekend. every chance we got. and i could do it again and again with her. even if we repeated the same words. just as long as i got to relive it for those few minutes. i can't believe life in my community is going on without me. i know my home is much quieter now. and i know my mom is longing for the days she walked me to elementary school, probably as much as i am. i wonder if when i leave college in four years ill be longing to go back to the beginning. should i be spending these moments living in the excitement because soon these will be the good old days? i can't see how they are. i like my dorm a lot. i can smell all these flowers. i can't believe im a pi phi. thats how i know im old. if i had chosen anything else, i would be denying my past. my mom is a part of me so thats why i chose what i chose. i have been waiting to be a pi phi for as long as i can remember. only i assumed i would be at smu. did i choose the right school? i didnt really choose because i wasnt ready to go and i don't think im ready to be here "
Tell me about yourself.,"     As soon as I am done with this I plan to go over to my friends, maybe to the gym. I don't really feel much like working. My biggest concern for this semester will be motivation my self to do the requried work. My telephone just rang. My air conditioner seems louder than all of the other ones that I have heard. Right now I am rather thirsty, having just walked the campus with my uncle and cousin. We ate at Wendy's and the food was salty. I wish I was in a cold swimming pool right now. This weekend was fun. We went swimming in the lake. College is kind of wierd not having my family around all of the time. I dont' miss them terribly, but I just feel strange without having them around to talk to for a few seconds of joke with. Classes have not been that hard these first several days, and I am wondering if they will pick up greatly as far as difficulty is concerned. Now I seem to have nothing on my mind. I am just staring at the computer screen. All I really need to do tonight is work on a few calculus problems. My neck is still a little sore. I will take some aspirin later. I will check my mailbox later today. My bare feet are getting cold on the tile floor. Now I am not really thinking of much. I feel like resting on my bed for about ten minutes before I head out of my room. In fact, right when I am finished writing this I am going to lay on my bed. I am ready to get into the full swing of college classes. Only about 90 days until Christmas break. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     I cannot believe that I am finally in college at the University of Texas, living the college life is such a tremendous change from the life that I have previously been living. Before I moved to college I lived with my mother, my father, and my younger brother Jeremy. Also living with us was our many many animlas, whom over the years grew and other times shrunk. My all time favorite however would have to be my cat Magic, whom i was very upset to leave. Magic has been my cat for about 13 years now, and he has been there though so much. Good times and bad times. The happy and the sad. More recently, about a two years ago, we had a new addition to our home. My dog Rocky, who I miss incredibly. I never thought that I would get so attached to an animal, much less a dog, becuase dogs never were my favorite pets. In fact I never really cared for dogs. But however it happened, it happened. I am totally infactuated with my dog Rocky. I would take him everywhere with me if I could. It is so hard to be at college and away from him. It is almost like he is my son or something,I often feel the need to dicspline him, and however it happens, I find myself talking to him. I anxiously await the holidays that I get to go home to see him. However, even more than my cat magic, my dog Rocky, I miss my dad. My dad has always been the most important person adn thing in my life, for as long as I can remember, I have always looked up to my dad, admired my dad, and wanted to be just like my dad. I can't stand to part from him. We have been more than just father and daugther, we have been best friends. We hung out together, laughed together and cried together. I could always trust him and tell him everything, as I still can. He always believed in me and had the most faith in me, and most important he always trusted me and my judgment. I was the one who always cooked for my dad, and ran arrands for him. I would do anything at the drop of a dime for my dad, as he would do for me. It has been hard moving to college and being away from him. I talk to him everyday, but its almost like i don't know what to say. I hate the fact that I am missing out on whats going on in his life, and he is not here to see whats going on in mine,  It just not the same hearing it over that phone. I no longer know where he is at every second, and its a hard change. I am happy to be growing upp and moving on with my life, but i don't want things to change between my dad and i. It hard because the more i grow, the less i need him, and i like that i need him, and that he needs me. Although it is hard being away form my dad, and the rest of m family, it makes the move and change so much easier having my boyfriend of 9 months, here at college experiencing the change with me. He lives in the same dorm as me (university towers) on the same floor just down the hall. It nice to have someone who i love so much be here to support me. We are lucky to have all the same classes and schedule so we always have a familiar face a around. we spend all of our time together, which i love. Every morning I make him breakfast ( i love to cook)  before we go to class. I actually cook every single meal every day for him. But i love it. Its like we are married which lots of people may not think is a good thing at this age, but its perfect. I love him so much, and he is a wonderful guy. OUr parents have become best friends in the time we have been dating. Our paretns are even going to Hawaii this winter togetrher. This summer, Paul and I (my boyfriends name is Paul) went to Europe together,  it was the graduation present to us from our parents. It was an incredible vacation and expereince. I had the time of my life. We went to Lonodon, and a few places in France. . . Nice, Cannes, St. Paul, adn my favorite Paris. I love the shopping. My parents love Paul and as far as I know his parents love me. It is the perfect relationshop and hopefully one day will be the perfect marriage, I know its a long way off, but hopefully not to long. I know that we can be together forever, however if things change, I will be okay to, I am always ready for change although I don't really like it too much. Its hard that we have still so much to go through being as this is just the beginning of our college lives, I hope that we can make it through it together. I have to work on not being so jeolous and controlling, and really just going with the flow. I don't always have to have things planned, and if he doesnt want to do things with me, i have to be okay with that. I am working on builing my own life separate from his and then i can improve my life with him. I am so anxious to start my life and be with him forever that i forget sometimes that i am only in college and a lot can change in the next four years. I am looking foward to the next four years. I just got in to the sorority of my choice (AEPhi). hOwever i am not even sure whether or not i definitely want to be in the sorority, i am not sure if it is really my thing or not. i am happy with my boyfriend, not looking for new guys, and i have never been the type to have a lot of close girlfriends, i think it may be good for me to associate more with girls. so i am going for it. if i change my mind i can always drop out later. well tomorrow is our first sorority party it is the Phi Tie party, Paul is going to come with me, I guess i will see more how i feel about this whole sorority thing tomorrow, well i have to go, my time is up.  "
Tell me about yourself.,"I don't really think there is much of a purpose to this assignment. Granted, I realize its purpose but do not find it to be entirely essential to this course. I do realize, however, that this   experiment   is to be able to tap into the minds of students for a multitude of reasons. One, assuming the student submitted factual personal information (i. e. name and social security number), then certain concerned faculty members can tap into the minds of students they, a) don't like, or b) about which they are concerned. Of course, this can be helpful to understand a student better, or should that student be suicidal, intervene in a timely manner. Unfortunately, if these submissions are not read when they are first processed, then the suicide could take place without due intervention. Of course now, whoever is reading this is probably evaluating my deep psychological reasons for even mentioning suicide. I am sure that this is being analyzed as my subconcious admitting to facts that my cognizant mind would never release. This, however, is not true. While one must accept the fact the subconscious and conscious directly interact, rarely does one prevail over the other. Granted, we have absolute control of the conscious--or at least, more control than that of the subconscious. I am sure, that by now, for a 17 year old college student, I have begun to come across as some sort of pyschological analyst who has put entirely too much thought into this essay and that, for the most part, this is a typical essay and those who submit similar writings are merely trying to impress the reader with their psychological knowledge prior to and INTRODUCTORY course. This is rediculous. As an instructor, s/he probably does not care how much one particular student knows or what their analytical take on this assignment is. And thus, I shall switch from this entirely too practical frame of mind to a more entertaining frame of mind. Why don't we (yes,   we.  As in, the poker players inside my head. Actually, I'm not a fan of poker, so we'll say that we're playing four-man Chickenfoot (dominoes). Please note that the use of   four-man   was not a sexual comment, but the use of   man   was simply to imply that there are four /participants/ in the game of Chickenfoot in my mind. As long as we're discussing dominoes, how about a little trivial information?  Afterall, one does not know when s/he will appear on a radio quiz or a game show. The dots of dominoes and die are known as   pips.   You may recognize   pips   from the rock-n-roll band   blah-blah-blah and the Pips.   This, obviously, as my age has already been discussed, was before my time, and thus, I cannot recall the name of the lead singer, but merely   the Pips. ) discuss my roommate. What to say about Patrick?  Well, I should not attempt to sum him up in words because it would do him no justice. Not that he deserves justice for his unsanitary, habitually lazy style of living, but he is human and our Declaration (let us be patriotic on Sept. 11th) so demands that every   man   (please revert to prior parenthetical insertion upon the proper intent of the usage of   man  ) be allowed the same just (the root of   justice) opportunities. Patrick has found that his calling to life is to frighten or shock people by the way he dresses. I assume that this is a phase, though its onset was around three years ago. He likes to present himself as a very demonic, Gothic rocker. Upon conversing with his girlfriend (aside from her abhorance of this behavior) he does it merely to get a reaction from people. His sole intentions are to be noticed. In fact, that later branches into his very strong desire to be famous some day in life. According to Erin, his girlfriend, he won't make it because he doesn't have the personality. She said he's too submissive. I can completely agree with this as he has wrapped himself (by his own will, mind you) around Erin's stubby little finger. Inside of him, somewhere, he has the need to feel wanted and maybe to a degree where he needs to feel submissive. Who knows?  Let's not talk about Patrick. We're going by fives. 2+3+5+10 = 20 points. I'm kicking butt. Reverting back (as I like to keep my segways under control) to the comment of   let us be patriotic on Sept. 11th,   when will this day be commemorated as a national holiday?  Do not you think it will be soon?  Afterall, if we have D-Day (whenever it falls) why shouldn't we have a day to observe the day when international terrorism (or so we assume it was) attacked America?  It will happen--soon. This is my prediction. I don't think that the day should be so sad. Afterall, people die every day. We don't celebrate all of their lives. Granted, this is on a broader spectrum and affects the patriotism of this nation, but there is no need to mourn eternally. Ahh. Bah. My 20 minutes is up. More on this later. rux at mail. utexas. edu for more thoughts and opinions. "
Tell me about yourself.,"During the weekend, I love to go to mall. To buy something that makes me feels good. If I have a chance to go in the mall, First, I would like to eat something in the restaurant because I get starve. I love to eat Chinese food. Sometimes I choose sweet sour chicken and fried rice. That is my favorite food. If I have a second choice that it would be pepper steak and white rice. When I am full, I start thinking of what I need t shop around other place to buy  what I need. At this time , I need to buy fall season cloths. All I have right now is one pair of jean and one sweater. That is not enough to wear for the rest of the season. All I need is one more extra sweater and another pair of jean. And then I would like to buy something to decorate my house. I would like to have of book holder because I have lots of books. Whenever I see interesting things on TV I would like to go to the mall and buy it. In my kitchen, I saw a microwave is not working anymore. On TV the commercial shows they are having a big sale in JCPenney. It cost about only sixty dollars. I think that is a good deal to buy a microwave for sixty dollars. I try to get a new laptop. But my budget is not enough to buy another computer. They are a pretty good deal for a Dell computer in a market place. The computer market is having a pretty good mark down of price now. But when I get everything together, it cost over one thousnad dollars  I need to spend all of it. I think the computer is popular consumer in the market. But i make a mind that I don't  want to spend not much money, because it is not worth it. Spending is not the way to feel better. How are you going  to control your mind is better way to concern it.   We are so busy living in collage life.  Everyone needs a rest in the weekend. Shopping in a mall is good subject of good things to relax your mind. Control you're budget and thinking of controlling your mind is the best way to think.        "
Tell me about yourself.,"I don't have too much on my mind right now, and if im worrying about anything, it may be about classes. This class in particular is not too troublesome, but this is my first year in college, and im noticing that the style of school is in many ways different. And its not that i don't think i will be able to adapt, but i am a little intimidated. The laid-back style of college allows for a lot of distractions and freedom. So i believe that if i set a pattern now to get everything that i need done, i will be much better off.   Not only, are the classes here different, but my whole social life has been turned upside down. I don't know whether i should  let go of most of my old acquaintences from high school, and dive right into new friendships. or to hang on to the people who i feel know me the best. I loved my high school years. I loved the people i grew close to, i loved the environment, i loved the things i was involved in. And now, i don't have any of those things to comfort me. I loved theatre, i remember all the plays i was in and all the fun times and great bonds i made with people. Including the director. He was like my second father, someone i could really talk to, but also someone who taught me a lot about myself. And the things he taught me really can't be put into words, but rather they can be applied to my life right now. I feel so much more grown up after growing close to him in 4 years and feel like if he believes in me, there is no reason for me not to. That may be my one biggest flaw. At times i have somewhat low self-esteem. Well, to refine that statement, i doubt myself and my worth at times. Never at a dangerous level, im not anywhere near depressed, but i do tend to put others before myself. I care so much about people in my life, and i expect the same from others. But that isnt the way it is most of the time. I put my heart out there, and often it gets passed over.   And on that subject, that is the main reason why i broke things off with my high school boyfriend. There were other contributing factors, but this past summer, i finally put myself before him and realized that i wasnt getting what i wanted out of the 8 month old relationship. I loved him so much, and deep down, i know he loved me, and still does. but he didnt try hard enough. And he says now he realizes that he didnt treat me as good as he should have, and i knew that he would eventually see that, that is why i broke it off--to make it obvious something was wrong. And it took him a long time to see that. We were best friends, and maybe that is why it took me so long to say something. Because i had so much faith in someone so close to me, i was sure i was exaggerating things, being selfish. But after enough people telling you that you deserve better, it really starts to make you think. I would always be the one putting forth the effort, i would always aplologize, i would always go out of my way for him, i would compliment him, etc. And ultimately, he wanted an easy relationship. He didnt want to have to make me feel special, even if he felt it deep down. And now he tells me this. and its very unlike him to see that he was insensitive for so long. He usually doesnt see things like that clearly. But maybe losing a girlfriend and best friend made him see things differently. I miss him though. I was the one who made this decision, i should be strong and not rely on him. But i miss him and talking on the computer to him everyday while he's at A&M lets me see the guy that i fell in love with. . especially because he is so nice to me lately. He claims that he's going to wait around for me, and that we will end up together again someday, but im not as sure as he is. I mean, i would love to be his girlfriend if he could treat me better. but we are so far apart, it seems silly of gaining a title of being a girlfriend, but being just as lonely. I need to be on my own for this new experience i am going through, and not attatched to his arm. I need to see who else is out there, this is college for goodness sake. But no matter who i meet, i will always compare them to him. I never thought of it that way, but he was my first love. Its weird to imagine that i really was in love, i never thought it could happen. But its very obvious that it was love. But for now i have to be strong, and just keep on the way things are. no matter how much i miss him. Because i don't want to get hurt again, not yet, not this far away. Im afraid things will just go back to the way they were, and i'll be 10 times more lonely. And its hard enough to meet friends here, there are so many people- i don't need to make it harder by being cooped up in my room all day talking to my boyfriend miles away. This school is funny like that. There are almost too many people to make friends. Everyone is doing their own thing, and its really easy to get sucked into hanging out with your old high school friends and not make new friends. But thats not what i came here for. I came here to meet new people, new open minded people, and have new experiences. and to redefine who i am as a person and a friend. But that doesnt mean i have to cut old ties alltogether. hmm. i wonder if its been 20 minutes yet. i think so. "
Tell me about yourself.,"what am i thinking? that is quesiton i sometimes ask myself when i'm things that are out of this world. thinking, to put the mind to work and have conversations in your head about whatever is on your mind at that moment or to ponder over a serious of questions or question such as this one. right, now i'm thinking of what to write, and as always not being able to think of anything worth writing. its not my thing to write out of the blue without having prethought what i was going to write. I'm sitting in front of my computer, cold and tired from a very long day. my dorm room is always to cold so i have to sit here shivering while i type. the cold may be affecting my train of thought since i'm preoccupied in thinking how i'm going to keep warm after this is over. i should have put on a sweater but for some reason i let myself remain cold and keep complaining about it. it's my fault really,i should just get up and put on a sweater or wrap a blaket around me. what stops me from doing it, i don't know. it could be because i have to stay here for twenty minutes typing or because i'm to lazy to actually get up and search for something warmer, or it could be because it won't be long after i put in on that i will have to take it off to go to sleep. i never found it comfortable to sleep with a sweater on, except of course in the extreme cases like when i used to go camping out in the mountains in the middle of january. i like camping, its the one thing that i love to hate and vice versa. during the day it nice to going hiking and stuff but during the night it can be horrible having to take a bath in the freezing cold and make dinner by fire and lamplight, not to mention the cold hard ground and the paper thin tents that are suppose to protect us from the 30 degree weather. i'm don't really like the cold but then again when its a hundred degrees outside i wish winter would come. people in general are never content with the weather. its either to hot or to cold,like food almost. we blow on soup to cool it down and hold ice cream in our mouths till it melts before swallowing it. my radio is on and so is the tv which has nothing to do with anything but we are suppose to write continuously for twenty minutes, so i thought i'd write that. its relaxing to be listenting to the radio, cause even when i'm down there's alway a song to cheer me up. right now i'm relaxed happy to be ahead in my reading but aware of a test i will have to take this friday. people always have the ablity to walk in at the wrong times. someone just knocked on the door and i shouted to them to come in and in seeing me at work they left but they did disrupt me which of course is always inviting except when i have to do something where i can't be interrupted like this timed writing. in 30 seconds, never mind i'm done. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     Currently my mind is drifting from one focus to another. Today is my 9 month Anniversary with my girlfriend and best friend in my life. She is the best thing that ever happened to my life. I want to by her a ring and I have been giving it plenty of thought. I have been experiencing a guilt trip as of last night. I thought about my grandmother, who is affected my Alzheimer's. I felt gult come over me when I thought of all the times I yelled at her. I live my grandmother but thats not the damn of it. I generally understand that I am not truely mad at my grandmother when I yell at her. I am mad at the disease. I don't want to loose her or any other member of my family. I got addmitted to the Business school thats the reason I am here. And I have been thinking that I have not earned the opportunity of a lifetime that I am living. I worked harder than most and I played 4 sports and still graduated 16 of 400 in my Senior class. But again I feel guilt when a prodigous amount of people introduce themselves and they mention their major. What should be a privelege to me is actually the most dreaded words I could say,   I'm in the Business School.   People look at me in dismay and in a downward direction which I can officailly say bothers me. I love my mom. . She called me today and gave me a few more pointers that should have stayed under 2 minutes in our conversation. She is so worried about me. Oh and this paper im writing is helping me to think of all the things that are roaming in this spaceous mind I have. My roomie says that I complain alot. . do I. My girlfriend has said the same but I disagree with them both. I just want to be the best at everything and I have to win or im not happy. Just knowing that my effort was not enough haunts me for days. God made me competitive and thats the way I live. Back to that Business thing. . I worked my butt of to get into that school and this college. See my parents had a divorce my junior year of High School. Thus, my lack of attending school cause my grades to faulter as well as my happiness. My dad left us and I can still see tears in my mom's eyes as we carried opposite ends of the furniture and tears trinkled down her face. Besides that I'm in love and I have the best girl I could ever dream of. Her mom says we can't be together but all through our Senior year we stayed together. Sacrafice, that is what makes a best- friend a best friend. Not loyalty and all the Universal answers to what makes a best friend. She sacraficed her family to be with me. Her mom said,   either u have him and loose your family or you can listen to me and forget about him.   She chose me in an instant. . For a long time I woundered why. . And to this day the only answer I could find is love. True love is what we share and today is 9 months. Love is like the wind, you can't see it but you can feel it. My grandfather had to raise me since I never had a father. That hurts me more than the world could ever know. Oh another thought came to me. I am suffering from sexual frustration. I'm not sure if I can say that but you asked for whats on my mind not what you want to hear right?  Well me and my girlfriend have not seen each other for alomost a month and 1/2. Seems like forever but we will be fine. We pray every night for help and hope to some day get married. I nedd to buy a ring. . let me write that down. If i complain too much sorry. Thats just me right?   "
Tell me about yourself.,"so Im in the computer lab of my apartment right now yeah these people in hear are kind of noisy. yeah I really wish I had my own computer, I talked with my dad today and he said maybe by Christmas theses walls are interesting. they really need to put paper in the copier and printer. I have to go all the way back up to my apartment and get paper so that I can make a copy and print out the psych. notes. yeah no computer is really annoying. Im thinking about what to write. what can I write that wont be too ummmm whats the word, I dont know lol. I wonder if theyll know what lol means. ha what a dork. yeah I dont seem like a weirdo hmmmm. I think Ill eat dinner after this. pot pies? hmmmm. oh wait pasta sounds really good right now and I have that ragu sauce in the fridge too. mmmmm. and then I can eat the Italian bread I got today with it too ah man Im getting really hungry, lol. ah man, its only been 4 minutes. you know, time goes by a lot slower when your in athletics esp. track. Like you can run a lap in 6O sec. doesnt sound like a lot of time but it really is. or lines in basketball. lines as in the ones you run. lol, that probably doesnt make any sense if you dont know what Im talking about. there was something else I was thinking about writing too before going off on the athletic path. hmmmm. what was it something about time. ok I forget. ah man someone just interrupted me, they had a question about the printer, see what I mean about the no computer thing? Not having my own computer really stinks. So anyways. I think Im going to work out tonight. I usually dont like to run on the treadmill but the one at the apartment isnt too bad. I think thats because I can look out the window when Im running lol, even as Im typing this stuff I am thinking about totally different stuff than what I am typing. like when I was typing about the treadmill I was actually thinking about how my typing has gotten faster since Ive been talking on instant messenger and that led me to think about how my roommate lets me use her laptop sometimes so I dont have to come down here, but her keyboard is a French keyboard and its really hard to type on because all the letters are switched. Ok, now my hand is starting to hurt well not the hand. more like that my forearm right below my elbow I fractured my thumb in fifth grade lol, that was out of nowhere well no, it was because I was thinking about my hand and then that led to my thumb. I remember when I was little and I would be riding in the back of the car with my family and I would just be thinking to myself like everyone does, I guess, well anyways. and I remember how I would go backwards on my thoughts and think of how I got to what I was thinking about. probably what this writing assignment is trying to do well anyways. ooooo those brownies sound really good too. maybe Ill make brownies when I get back upstairs ooooo those sound so good. I am so hungry!!!! I dont know what I would cook them in though. I dont know if we have a pan I guess Ill find out when I get back upstairs Im almost done with my laundry. I need to start reading the psychology book too and taking notes. lol, I dont think I actually think about all the stuff I have to do as much as this writing assignment may make it seem I really hope I like architecture. lol, that was out of no where too. well actually the truth is that I cant type as fast as I can think and while Im typing Im actually thinking about other stuff than what I am typing. hmmm l4 minutes what made me think about architecture was that I was thinking about psychology and that made me remember how I thought about majoring in psychology (thats really hard to type!), but that was after I had already made up my mind to major in architecture. I dont know if architecture is just a phase or if its something I really want to do. I dont know. well just have to see how it goes really I wonder why the time thing is green anyways.  I really, oh now I forgot. oh wait. I really hope it works out. Ive even thought about government though so I can do something about womens rights, I think that would be cool. maybe I could do both could I do both? I dont know this is so confusing, how are you suppose to already know what you want to do with your life!!?? But of course Derek always knew he wanted to be a pilot. l7 min. now I wish I had more time I hate how everyone is oooooo ahhhhh air force academy. who the heck cares, its just the air force academy and no its not impossible to get into I could have gotten in if I wanted to but I didnt want to I have no sympathy lol, yeah probably none of this makes a lot of sense since you dont know what Im talking about. but I dont think thats the point. its just to see how one thought leads to another and then another and so on. not really mattering what your thoughts actually are. just so you can see how one thing leads to another.  lol, I am SO redundant!!!!        "
Tell me about yourself.,"the thought of everyone or anything making sense is no sense at all. people or things are living to be apart of the same things. to understand the most simplest of things is to want to understand the hardest of things. if we were to understand all that is around us then what? we seem as humans to conquer all that is unknown or well known as something we can overtake. why is this? if we understood everthing about ourselves then would we conquer overselves and in turn become so self absorbed that it turns out for the worst? maybe our own minds are the foundation and key to unlocking every mystery that lies in this world. that may be the reason that it is so complicated, since it does not want to be discovered in fear of damnation. we find ourselves seeking that which is not wanting to be sought after. maybe if we just left the hinding unknown come to the surface on its own then the world would be more peaceful than ever. we want to satisfy and gratify each other yet nothing is truly workin as a whole. in that case why don't we curse each other? would this work? there wouldn't be heroes without tragic situations that call on them. there wouldn't be compassion without suffering. this may be the other mystery of life. we suffer from all sorts of pains. anxiety, stress, and heartache. then this may be the key to how the  world goes round. there must always lie a purpose or mystery to be solved or individuals would possibly goe mad. living without purpose. the sights that are before us lie challenges that we all must go through. . animal. man. all the same in our   civilized  , yet primal instincts. we find that the more of one thing evolves another becomes a mystery. we try to understand our primal side of existance yet this is where we come from. our strive to learn, succeed, or conquer friends and foes. the animal coming out of us? no the animal coming back to us. these triumphes or downfalls are the minds tricks on itself that keeps everthing from total damnation. if we did unlock the nooks and crannies of our world then what then. find a way to kill or destroy it. with everything else we have. from finding how the world turns, our habits have caused an imbalance of many levels. the people all around us are capable of so much together that the universe wouldn't stand a chance. but that may be the reason we coannot truly get the whole picture of how we really feel for one another. the thoughts that we have are very primal. we seek out our sexes to comfort a zone but not a domain. if we all truly united then our common strength could destroy rntire galaxies since we have already done fractions of that with partial unification. this may be the clue to how realtionships may work in general. we find ways to unite and ways to spread out. everything that may be silly to an outsider like colthes, sex, or religion. these pose for issues that seperarte us at the same time. the same that our animal instincts may tell us as they come back and not come out as many think. think about the possibilities. or the downfalls. mysteries of any sort are our key that may never be unlocked       "
Tell me about yourself.,"Today I woke up feeling completely gross and sick!I knew it was a mistake to go out and party last night when I knew I was coming down with something but I couldn't stay in my dorm room for another second~! My roomate is already driving me crazy and I am sick and tired of all men! where do they get off thinking they can use me and other women at there disposal. Does ben really think his life is so much more important than mine or more difficult because he is going to med school. His life  could be a lot more rough! Aah, what was I thinking he's not really even my type I don't have time for another boyfriend/heartbreak! How could he sit there and tell me I am the perfect woman for him but just not right now! Like I am supposed to sit around on my ass and wait for him, I don't think so. Gosh there is so much to do this weekend. Laundry, homework, visit with Sarah, suck up to my Dad and if that's not enough we had to add being sick and on my period to the list! Like I don't have enough to deal with. I wonder If Annie is ever going to quit smoking, you think that the prospect of having children would be enough to make her quit but it's not. I wonder why thats the case. HOw can smoking be that addictive that it can stop you from bringing another human llife in to the world? I wonder why she started smoking in the first place. It will be cool when she has kids of her own to see what they turn out to be like? I wonder if I'll be there cool Aunt Rebecca, I kind of like the sound of that! I'm still typing away in my dorm room it feels like such a sauna in here. Our suitmates our constantly turning off the air. What's wrong with them? Do they like to sweat. My roomate is such a rotten brat! It's so obvious she is an only child suffering from   only child syndrome  . She acts and talks to me like I'm her mother/maid. Oh well, I won't be seeing to much of her starting next week. Swim lessons start, and I'll be really busy studying and working. I still have a lot of reading to do for my children's literature class. It's such a fun class. Getting a grade for reading childrens books! The teacher cracks me up you can definetly tell she used to be a librarian. When she danced the other day in class I thought I would exploded! So my times almost up and I feel like I am rambling now, and my hands are begining to hurt. I'm not used to all of this typeing! I should probably call the woman at the SSB after this I have been meening to do that and just haven't gotten around to it! Gosh so many thigs to do!                                 "
Tell me about yourself.,"RIght now I'm thinking about not that much. I'm actaulyl ratehr relaxed. I'm thinking about how I miss my boyfirend, even though he is jsut on the otehr side of the room. It's one of those thigns where you're just really happy about a person and you can't stop thinking about them. He's just sitting there playing a video game and I'm really excited, but yet I still miss him and think about him. It's a rather cool feeling. I'm also thinking about my writting assingment in my rhetoric class. I've been trying to find stuff for it all day, and it's driving me crazy,a nd I still have more homework to do for it later, so that is still on my mind. I'm thinking also that I want to listen to music. Music relaxes me a lot, and I really enjoy listening to it will I'm doing mindless things. I enjoy it at other times too. I'm also craving sweets a lot. I'm addicted to them, so that's not really that unusual. I'm trying to rmemeber where a resturatnt is in Houston. Prior to this I read an email from my mother telling me about wehre her and my father ate for their 30th weding anneversary, but I couoldn't really htink of where it is. I'm also trying to think about waht kind of food htey sereve. Earlier in teh day I watched hte first half of hte TExns game, so I'm also wondering if they won or not. My sister is also awayu at college, we're twins, and I'm wondering if any day things willl get better. It's the first time we've been apart and she's having a miserable time, so I'm wondering constantly how she's doing,a nd what I can do to make it better for her. Randomly I also think about my parents. I just read an email from one of htem, so taht's why they are currently on my mind. Normally I wouldn't miss them, but my dad had a heart attack a few days before I moved up here, so I think about him a lot more htat I probably would. My email from my mom realated to how they're eating, so that got me thinking on that. I'm also thinking about my math class. I have homework to do in tehre later tonight. I really don't like the calss. It's riddle math, so I spend my time wondering about how I'm going to get thropugh there. Currently I  m trying to think of how to jsut get through my homework, muchless my tests. THer are no equations, so it drives me crazy. I really don't want to even look at my homework. It's about the only homework I've procratinated on since I  ve been here. I'm also wondering what is wrong with me in my current medical condition. I have dizzyness problems, and I'm trying ot think of a time when I can see a doctor. My sister is having them now too, so it's on my mind a lot more. Now I'm starting to feel stressed. Usually I don't feel stressed, but then again I usually don't write out things that have been flowing through my mind. I'm wondering if I can think of things to talk about for twenty minutes. It's actually somewhat hard given that it's only me talking, well typing and there is no one or anything to converse with on the other end. I'm also trying to figure out when I'll have time to get my boyfriends birthday gift. I've spent all day, and all week,a nd the past montsh trying to figure it out. But now   m going to go to  a store tommorrow to finally get something. But I'm worrying about if the store will actually have somethign that I can get. I've never been to this store, but at 5 tommorrow I will find out about the stuff int ehre. According to my firned she says that I'll be able to find stuff there. Hopefully I will, otehrewise I'll have to rushdeliver something here, and that cost extra money,a nd I'm constantly worrying about money. I am botehrd especially when I have to pay for unneccessary things. Which the extra shipping cost would fall into that category. I'm also thinking about what position I would like to run for. Earlier today I went to an RHA meeting. Unfortuantly I missed the first half, so I didn't get all the information. I'm thinking about being something for my wing, which is good if I want to be an RA next year. THe other positions seem like high positions where I would have to campaign a lot, and I  m not that type of person. I'm still worrying somewhat about if I would have to campaign for my wing thing. I really would preffer to do that, I just hope I don't lose to someone who just casually felt like running for it, and wasn't as into it as me. Kind of like the girls who I think of who voted not to keep the bathroom door unlocked. THose eveil people. Everytime I go to the bathroom, I really hate them, and wish they weren't so casual about their voting no. Everyone had to vote yes, otherwise it would remain unlocked. Rather unfair. But I really get annoyed even when I see them. I've been sitting in front of htis computer too long today doing school work. I  m actaully quite frustrated with the internet. I needed to find a very simple thing, but yet the search engines would not co-operate and gave me horrible feedback for the sites. THe noise of hte video game in the background is rather interesting. I'm not much into video games, unless I get to shoot something, but I still wonder what's going on over there. Or how guys are entrigued for hours by a simple mouse or control set. The same screen, all day long. I've wondered if it actually   fries   people's brains when they play. Or if it interferes with their education, as in if they played video games their whole childhood. The noises on the video game are starting to remind me of hte noises that my boyfriend makes. I'm wondering howmuch time the wing representative will take. Supposedly it's only one hour, but I wonder if there's something hidden in tehre. I'm not sure if I'll be able to manage that, flag football, with practices nad games, and a soccer team with my floor. I'm not sure how to tell my best friend if I dont' want to play. I do want to play, I just don't know if I'll have the time. But I also wnat to meet peoiple on my floor and spend time with my best friend. So that is a rather hard argument. Why does life have so many conflicting htings, and not enough hours in teh day. I want to just expand time, and do everythign I want, and stop rushing through it and      "
Tell me about yourself.,"    Today, i started the day with a serve headache. All day long this feeling has been with me from my first class to work to homework. In the early months i was told that i had a tumor near my pitutary gland. Ever since then I was put on some medication to help dissolve this tumor. Friday, i was schedule to have a MRI done, well today the result came back. As the doctor reported, i the medicine is working well. I just have to keep taking the medication. What a big relief. I felt great that i will not have to have surgery to remove the tumor. But lately, i have had headache that hurt realyy bad. When i toldmy mother, see thought i sgould get me eyes checked. She thinks that i need glasses. Who knows? I hope not. MAn, my brother is in the 5th grade and they required him to buy a recorder. Yes, he does not know how to play it. So it just sounds like a bunch of noise. This is what I hear in background as well as the loud tv that is showing commericals. I feel sleepy. Actually i don't know if there is time in which i am not sleepy. I work alot as a server and then get to come to do some homework before i fall asleep. So not much gets done. I wish there was just a day were i could relax, do something fun and not have to worry about what is due tomorrow, next week, in a couple of months get my drift. i know we just had a summer vaction. Well, i took summer school for the second half. so it feels like i have been in school for a couple of months. College is so much different from high school. Alot of responsibility is on the student. It is very easy to miess up. So far, i try to take one think at a time. It is hard to jugle 10 things at once, even if they are not school related. I deal with school, work ,friends, family and down time for myself which is usually the gym. One thing that i do miss is dealing with the boyfriend. After 2 1/2 yrs, i decided to break it off. I felt that i needed some breathing room. But there have been days were i miss  him. At those times, i just want him back but then i see that i can't just go and come when i want too. it is not fair to him. Lately i have been feeling lonely, very lonely. Especially since i don't see my friends as often because i live off campus, at home. Which means that i have some what of a curfew. Plus to travel from my house to campus is 15-20 way. Any way i really don't have time. This guy took very good care of me. I know, so why did i leave. Well he treated our relationship as we were, married. I could not even talk to friends with =out him geeting jealous or us getting a arguement. He wanted to spend all his free time with me and expected me to do the same. Well, i appreicate my friends and he did'n see that. "
Tell me about yourself.,"        Lately, I have been having all sorts of feelings. All my life I have lived in San Antonio, TX and now moving to Austin feels so different. I feel so lonely because I barely have any friends in Austin and I am to shy to approach people. Hopefully my year will get better. I don't think that my roomate is too fond of me. I don't understand why she barely talks to me? I try to be friendly. All I do all day is read or call my friends back in San Antonio so that I don't feel lonely. It's odd really that I talk to my mom quite often on the phone.    On top of that I have problems with my boyfriend. I don't know what's wrong with me, but I am having serious trust issuses. I have been with him for four years and I should be able to trust him, but he lives so far away and i don't get to see him much. How do I know if he's doing any thing behind my back? Should I even think like this? Does he trust me? I really do love him. Only recently did I discover that I love him. I wonder if the two of us will ever be together in the future. I really hate my culture when it comes to this kind of stuff. Why do we have to have arranged marriages? What is the point in that?       I hope I do well in school this year. Last year I got good grades, but i really want to make my parent sproud. I feel bad fo rthem really. They pay so much money for my education and living. I feel as though I owe it to them to make them proud after all that they do for me. I really should get a job, but my schedule really doesn't allow me to. I'm not done with class till 5 everyday and I start the day as early as 8. Hopefully next year my schedule will be better and I can get a job and take on some responsibilities for myself.    Living away from home is so different. It's strange really. I didn't think that I would miss home so much. I was so glad to finally leave and be on my own and have freedom. I don't even know where anything is in Austin and I hate bothering the people that I do know in Austin for directions. I don't know if it bothers them that I keep calling.     Maybe I should join a sorority or something so that I can meet more people. I wonder if I can even handle being in a sorority with school work though.      I can't believe I actually decided to change my major. From computer science to nursing, wow that's a big change. Well all I know is that I want to do something dealing with kids because I love kids and they usually love me. I don't want to be a teacher and not a doctor because that is way to much schooling for me. I think being a pediatric nurse will give me the oppurtunity to interact with children and help them. If only my mom would be happy with the decision I made. I don't know what her problem is anyways. It's my life, I should be able to do what I want and what make me happy.     To tell you the truth about what i am thinking at the moment right now, I am really scared about this writing assignment my hands are shaking and I have no idea why. It should be easy for me like writing in my diary . I guess it's because of the fact that I am going to be graded on it. O well, hopefully I do well.     I'm really tired and my back is hurting me and my time is almost up, so goodbye i'm going to sleep.           "
Tell me about yourself.,"Am not in the best of moods right now. I have something bothering me at this time. But I take my mind of my problems by thinking of happier times or doing my homework. I am worried about some really personal problem which is killing me inside.  However, life goes on. Am good now, or at least not feeling so down. This is my first homework am doing ever since the weekend. Sounds really bad, but I console myself by having it in my mind that, am better off than many others.   AT this very moment Am listening to music while typing. I really like music, it gives me a peace of mind, makeing me feel better. And it always reminds me that, life is what you make of it. If you make it sad, your life is going to be sad and vice versa. I always try to think positively, that helps the mind grow.   I decided to do my assignment now, because I was feeling down ever since last night, and because this is all the time I will have. So if I don't do it now, I`ll probably not have sufficient time.   Guess what! Life in college is very stressing, so I always try to keep a huge distance from the college stress. I always thought that I was too young to get stressed out but now its happening to me. But hey, life must go on, so I am trying to make the best of it, even in times of stress.   I like my life right now, I really don't regret doing any of the wrong things in my past because, I know that they all came a long way to make me a better person, what I am today is a result of my ups and downs so far in my life.    I don`t type that very well, so there will be I hope not too many errors. Life is one of the best things we have. We can and should always try to make an impact in the lifes of others- a GOOD impact.     "
Tell me about yourself.,"    I am so nervous about what I got on my economics test. I know that I spent a long time studying, but I will be very upset if I don't get at least a B. I can't wait till next weekend when I get to go to Lubbock to visit Ryan. I hope that the Chili Cookoff will be fun. It sounds like it will be entertaining. I am upset that I am not going to get to Sara, though. I wish I could go to Lubbuck this weekend, but I have two tests on Monday. I am so stressed out about those test. I am going to spend a lot of this weekend studying. After I get those test out of the way I need to spend a lot of time on my english paper. I feel like I can never get caught up. I am looking forward to the Phi Psi mixer tongiht. I hope that I can meet some really nice guys. Actually, I don't care if I meet nice guys or not, I am just looking forward towards getting to go out. Lately I feel like all I ever do is study. College is so much more stressful than high school because you don't know what to expect. I am not sure if I am studying enough. At least I will be able to tell after I receive my grades from all of these tests. I am so tired. I wish I could take a nap. Hopefully after class I will have time to eat, workout, and take a nap. I am really upset that I haven't had much time to work out lately. When I was in high school I had cheerleading practice everyday. I was always working out. Now the only thing my body is use to is walking around to all my classes. It makes me feel so out of shape. Britany Spears is the best. I am listening to her CD right now. I had so much fun at her concert. It was weird to actually see her in person. I am so glad that I have been understanding my Calculus lately. At first I was worried that I was going to have to drop the class. I am glad that I decided to stick with it, because now it isn't so bad. The only part that sucks is the homework. It takes forever to do because the questions are so tedious. I am really nervous about completeing the test in 50 minutes. I can barely do one problem in 20. Hopefully they won't be as hard as the homework problems. I am praying that they are a lot more general. I hope that Ryan and I have time to talk tonight. It seems like I am always busy with Zeta new member functions and he is always busy with his rush stuff. It will be  a good thing for me to be able to see him. I need to figure out which airport to fly out of. I hope the planes aren't really full, or else I won't be able to go because I fly stand by. I hate flying stand by. It is such a pain. You have to arrive at the airport at least two hours before your plane even departs. I don't know why I am complaining. It is a lot better to fly than to drive. Once I drove to Lubbock from my hometown, Colleyville. It seemed never ending. Plus the scenery was not very visually pleasing. At least I was riding with Sara, my best friend. We kept each other occupied. That was so funny when we both started singing that one song. We could not stop laughing. Another reason I don't like driving is because it takes up time that I could be doing other things. At least when I fly I can read, do homework or even sleep. When  I am driving I have to concentrate the whole time. I need to go over to the business school today before five. I need to change my passion panel registration times. I am so frustrated with that whole system. I wish I could just get in the ones I wanted. "
Tell me about yourself.,"  I am so glad it is Friday. I am going home because my friend is also going home and his parents are out of town, so he is going to have some parties. I know it will be fun. I am also going to get to watch my brothers football game. He is a senior this year, and from what he has told me he is doing good in football. I only live an hour away from Austin so I don't have a long drive. It could be long though if I-35 is bad. I just go North on 35 until I get to Temple so I am happy about that because I don't have far to go. I also miss my boyfriend who I will get to see tonight also. We have been going out for 6 months now, which is definately a record for me. I sometimes ask myself what in the world is wrong with me?  All my friends and my parents also ask me that same question. I just tell them I have no idea. He is a real nice guy though, and will do anything for me. He pays for everything and takes me anywhere I want to go or do. I do not like Austin much, but i love UT. I know that is weird but I'm not much of a city girl. I hate all the traffic and the weird people. That is why I love going home because it is out in the country. We have trees and ponds surrounding us and not huge buildings. It is also a lot more peaceful out in the country and you don't have the sounds of cars or big rigs. I like the apartment I am living in this year. I have three other girls as roommates and it is a lot of fun. They are also from a small town so we get a long really well. Last year I lived in the dorms and I hated them. I lived in San Jacinto and they were real nice for a dorm but I didn't like them because I didn't have a kitchen or my own privacy. It really just didn't feel like home. My apartment is a lot better mainly because it is bigger. Well I wonder what I am going to do this weekend. Probably go to Cole's and do some homework and read. I want to float the river, I know I can talk Cole into doing that with me. Cole is my friend coming into town because his parents are out of town.  He plays baseball for Howard Payne in Brownwood. His sister also goes there and she plays volleyball, and throws the shot and disk in track. There is also a guy from my school that plays basketball there. I actually live in Little River- Academy. Which is about 10 minutes outside of Temple. We are a 2A school and we won the basketball state championship last year. It was an awesome experience. It was the first time we had won state in any sport. We got second place in 1998, we lost to Krum by like 10 points. Well I think I am going to take a shower and eat and then leave Austin so I can get home in time to go to my brothers pep-rally. I talked to him last night and he said he was going to get to participate in the pep-rally so that starts at 3:00, so I'm probably going to leave in about an hour. That way I won't have to rush. This also seems like the longest 20 minutes of my life. I think I am going to have chicken strips for lunch and fruit punch to drink. I am very excited about next weekend. I am going to College Station to see my best friend and we are going to go to Ag-Kickoff. Pat Green, Cory Morrow, Roger Creager, Cross Canadian Ragweed, and other bands are playing there. That will be a lot of fun and I am real excited. I went on the big ski trip last year with all of them and that was also a blast. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     I just took that Pre-testing thing for psychology and it made me think a lot about how I view myself. It kind of put me in a bad mood because I realized how much I look down on myself. It was interesting to learn that much about myself just by taking a test. I don't know if that was one point of the test but it made me think a lot. I realized how scared I was at one point about how I am scared to speak up for myself. I wish I could but I am very worried that I will make a wrong point. Even right now I am scared to write the wrong thing even though there is no right or wrong thing to write. I love this classical music. For some reason it make me more at ease, I can never work without some kind of distraction or something else for my mind to think about. I wish I could talk to people that I don't know easier. I was so scared to walk into my class late today. I didn't know if my TA was going to get mad but she saw me and so I had to go in anyways. When I walk around this campus I feel like so small and worthless compared to everyone. I got lost this morning and I was to scared to ask for directions because I don't trust they will give me the right way. I know it makes no sense whatsoever. It is wierd how different music puts a person in different moods. First, I was listening to classical and I felt peaceful and then alternative came on and it made me feel more awake and then jazz came on and it was soothing. I think listening to a variety of music helps a person be in a mood that they feel like being in. I don't know if it is the music that puts the person in a mood or if it is the mood that picks the music that makes them pick the music they feel like listening too. My classes seem to be discussing sort of the same topic which seems to help in understanding each one more. I never realized my mind jumps from one thing to another so much. It is like before I finish one thought I already begin another. It is hard to concentrate when my roommate is on the phone with her mother right now because I am hearing like four things at once. I am not used to having to share my space and have someone around all the time. I guess I am just going to have to get used to it. I am very jittery right now and I don't know why. I think I need to learn how to relax because I am already getting stressed out and I don't think that is a good thing. It is wierd I start to look at the clock and it makes me start typing more even though I am not thinking more it makes me just start typing more since I know my time is almost up.  "
Tell me about yourself.,"I just got home from a friend's apartment today. As of right now I have so many thoughts going through my mind. I have a hard decision coming up to make. It is if I want to join a soroity or not. One of my really good friends is going to rush this semester. I'm not sure if I want to do if she is going to at the same time. I'm not sure it is the right thing to do together. However, I'm still tempted to do it. The question is if it is right for me. My parents would both flip out if they found out I wanted to do it. When they hear the word   soroity   they automatically think drinking and drugs. However I have met many people in different soroity's and they are all really good people. Many of them are smart and do not fit your stereotypical soroity girl. All of the ones I have talked to swear by their life that it has made them a better person. One of my really good friends is in one and she has improved in character in only good ways. I remember her back in high school, and compared to now she is much more confident. There are many other things that she says has helped her character but that is the one that stands out the most. I really don't know what to do. It's all up in the air for now. I should talk to someone else outside of the college atmosphere and see what they think. I'm trying to collect opinions, but they have all been negative so far. Those negative opinions prolong my decision making. I figure if I do it then I have to do it now or I never will. The bad part is that I want  no regrets later. I don't want to look back and say   I wish I had done that.   I've made that mistake before and, don't want to do it time and again. I think a soroity is a great way to get involved with community activities as well. I know there are volunteer groups out there. I love doing community service and the events they do really benefit other people. Another one of my concerns is the time consumption. I know if I do this all of my waking moments will be dedicated to this one thing. I'm not sure if I can handle that or not. Plus I don't take rejection very well either. So I'd rather not risk it, but then again there is that no regrets thing playing in the process. Guess decisions will be made at a later time when I have more information about everything. Right now I like the college life that I'm living. I've met great people. My only complaint is about my room. It's so cold in here that I'm going to catch hypothermia and die before the semester is over. I can't feel my hands and I have to wear sweatershirts and slippers all the time. I doubt anyone can do to much about it. It's only been ten minutes since I started this assignment. I feel like it's been the full twenty. Another thing I don't like about my floor here in Jester is the fighting over the washing machines. For awhile we only had one working washing machine for the entire floor. I'd have to do my laundry at like 4 in the morning just to get some of it done. Now we have three but they always seem to be busy, and no one comes to take out their clothes when they are finished washing. As if no one else needed the machines. I swear sometimes I think I'm never going to have clean clothes again. I bought more socks just in case I didn't get clean ones for a long time. Sadly, I've only been here two weeks in Austin and I've already been to the Highland mall three times. Each time I really have no idea why my friends and I went. Only one time did we have something that we had to get immediately. All it was a white shirt for a party. The traffic down here gets on my nerves. I think Austin has the worst highway system in the world. How could someone construct such an awful system?  Don't they see the danger they are putting all the drivers in. I think I've nearly gotten into like ten wrecks. It's crazy. It's so hard to get around. Just simply trying to get to a Walmart is a pain. Thankfully I don't have to go that often. Ever since I got to Austin I my nights and days have gotten a little thrown off. I sleep at such random hours sometimes. I'm suprised I'm not sick yet. With the cold room and the funky sleeping times. Oh well it's the price you pay to be at UT. I'm so scared that I'm not going to do well in my classes. I'm not the worlds greatest test taker. Since all of my classes are based on tests I'm worried. I concentrate and pay attention but I know that's not enough to make it. My study habits are bad too. I need to get some new ones really quick!   "
Tell me about yourself.,"     right now im sitting here listening to dave matthews and my roommate is eating fritos with bean dip so i can smell the bean dip and its pretty nasty- ruffles with french onion dip is so much better but whatever- if thats what she wants to eat then thats fine with me. i think im going to go to the gym and work out tomorrow- the navy stuff hasnt been very much running or working out or anyhting so its kind of pointless to call that my workout for the week. i think maybe its because were just coming back from the summer and maybe people are out of shape and stuff or something because the navy should be a,little more hard core than its been. i think the new dave cd is kind of weird but its pretty good- the type of stuff you can listen to over and over without getting sick of it or something. this keyboard is so weird to type on- im used to my desktop keyboard and this one feels so weird because i like have to reac across it or something- i don't know what is so weird about it. i really wanted chick fil a for dinner today but it closes so early at the union- its pretty annoying- so i had to get wendy's which is good but its not what i wanted. when i was little i lived in north carolina and i used to get a number 6 with sweet tea- the sweet tea in the south is so good- and then i moved to new jersey and you can only get unsweetened tea and you have to put sugar in it and its pretty gross because then the sugar doesnt even really dissolve into the tea so you get nasty granules of it in your straw. i don't even know if you can order sweet tea down here- i havent tried but i doubt it. you have to dissolve the sugar into it before its cold because its so much better that way. now i want some sweet tea but theres no way im going to be able to find any right now so maybe ill have to figure out a way to get it for tomorrow or something. i think my cd is over now. no its not. i don't know why i always think its done right here but i always think that and its pretty annoying. oh well i guess its a nice surprise to still have a lot more left on the cd. my stereo stops after one cd instead of just going on to the next one. maybe i should figure out how to program it so it just goes to the next one. i feel like im typing really loudly and im distracting emily or something. oh well she can live. im really tired and its only like 9:45. probably because i woke up at like 5:30 this morning. this song is definitely the best on this cd. i love dave matthews- I've been to so many concerts and they were all awesome. ill have to find one down here to go to or maybe ill just wait until im back home and go to one then. that way i would be able to hang out with my friends back there. not that i wouldnt be able to hang out with them anyway. it doesnt smell like bean dip anymore- now it smells like air freshener. i wonder who thought of making up air fresheners- its so random. is this supposed to be in complete sentences and with good punctuation or anything?  i don't think so- so oh well. my knee hurts. i think i should ice it or soemthing but i don't have an ice pack. i guess ill have to get that sometime. an ice pack and sweet tea. if i wasnt typing right now i would write that down somewhere but hopefully ill remember it later. this song sucks and im thirsty now becasue i was thinking about sweet tea. you can't even order sweet tea in the north because they look at you like youre retarded and then theyre like um are you retarded and then youre like no give me iced tea and some sugar packets but im not going to be ahppy because its going tp be nasty. i could go for some pizza- liek the good stuff you can get in real pizzerias- is that how you spell pizzeria?  i guess it doesnt matter. i miss the italian food from up there so much. i can't wait to go home for christmas just because the food is so good up there. not taht the food isnt good down here- its just all mexican or tex-mex or barbeque adn who can live off of that all the time?  i need more pasta. penne ala vodka is possibly the best food ever created. i think ifigured out the problem- im too short for this desk or something. you have to be like really tall to sit here and type forever because if youre not then you start getting all pissed off because its weird to type here. or maybe its just me. i doubt it. ill have to ask emily what she thinks at the end of this thing because i swear this is just a weird position to be in. hmm. im thinking about getting some phone books to sit on or something. haha how funny would that be?  and im not even abnormally short or anything- its just weird to be here like this. im so "
Tell me about yourself.,"     I am afraid of being here. I think that I am not smart enough or that I just don't have what it takes. I think about my boyfreind alot! he is my bestfriend. Sometimes I feel like I can't live without him. I hate feeling that way but i can't help it. my biology class is stupid. i hate sitting there for an hour and a half wondering what the heck she is talking about. i wonder what my mom is doing right now. my little sister is in school right now and is probably having way more fun than i am. i can't wait until october 4th it is going to be great. i get to finally see my boyfriend again after 2 months. gosh that seems like a long time. i wonder if he is thinking of me right now. i know he better have wrote a letter on sunday. i love getting his letters. they make me feel very happy and i read them over and over and over. sometimes i don't knwo if i am just kidding myself about our relationship but then i remember how much i miss him and how perfect we are together. is there actually soemthing out in the universe that is perfect?  is there some object that can meet standards that to majority is perfect?  i know i am not perfect. i am so nervous about gaining weight. i always watch what i eat but it always like too much no matter what i eat. i hate feeling that wat too. i love beanie babies. they are soo cute. i used to collect them but now I dont. not that its because i got older but just because i don't have the money to spend on them anymore. I wonder why people are the way they are. Some people can be soo mean but have no reason to be that way. I wonder if I am that way. I wonder if people see me as snobby or dumb. I always look around the room and i wonder if people are just as confused as me. I try to look as if i am not confused but i don't think it works to much. I want to move with my boyfriend. I want to be near him alwyas. I always think about him. Is that unhealthy?  I like pizza. it is vrey good i want pizza now. i love fruit too. i think fruit can be better than icecream although i love icecream too. if i had to choose right now i would eat a peach. i don't know why but tomorow i would probably eat icecream. I don't think that i fit into this city. i think sometimes that maybe i shoould have stayed in killen. i love music i have to listen to it in order to make my day start out good. i love dirty south music but then again i love all kinds of music. how can someone only like certain types of music?  i don't believ e that. they make themselves think that. I think that music is a form of expression and you should listen to the music before saying  what is that,country?     ewwww!    I love anything that makes me feel good inside. I kind of would like to move to florida. my friend Argelis lives there but i went there for a band trip and i had such a good time. i was with my boyfriend and we did everything. evreybody told us that they sat around. we went on every ride there was. then before my boyfriend left to the navy we went to San Antonio. we went there all by our selves and did everything our way. no one  to tell us what to do or how to do it. it was great. We saved all our money and made sure we had enough to spend. I loved the shows at sea world. My favorite was fools with tools and how they made fun of all the other shows. It was great. There too me and my boyfriend went to every show and eveyr ride although there werent much rides. I hope we don't have to read our papers infront of the class. I don't think i did my paper right. What if i sound stupid?  oh well, i am probably not the only one that thinks that. i am not sure if i am going to switch my major becaus psychology is soemthing that i have always wanted to learn. my highschool teacher was soo cool. I loved visiting the Austin State hospital. It was so fascinating how those people could actually think those ways and believe everything they feel. I kind of felt sorry for some of them too. I don't know how to feel when it comes to people that are disabled, shoudl I feel sorry or luck to know them? "
Tell me about yourself.,"Why am I doing this? I don't feel like typing for 20 minutes. this is bound to be very boring. i'm already bored. i still have way too much time to kill. I'm really hungry. haven't had breakfest yet. i need to finish my homework though. I want to go out this weekend. my brother is also coming into town. I'm still bored. As usual, a song pops into my head when iu am really bored. I'm wearing no pants right now. its somewhat drafty. i'm going to look out my window now. no one is outside. i want some fresh air but i still have 16 minutes to go. I really should have taken a shower before i started this. Still hungry. my roomate is studying. i feel like bothering him. i just got offered a single room but i'm not taking it. I really want to listen to some music while i do this but  i can't.  we're not going to make it    pops into my head. I''m now going to stare at the poster on my wall. I really should throw out the  trash and make my bed. I still have to read my psychology textbook before i leave for my next class. I also need to workout. I need to learn out to type 80 words a minute. damn my fhand hurts. sucks to have tendonitis in both hands. 12 minutes to go and still extremely bored. I'm reaching my angry stage right now. I want to eat and i have to kill 11 more minutes, Might as well try some meditation. still have yet to decide if i want to finish my work before i go out tonight or if i do. I need to go meet someone tonight so i guess i better work. hey at least i'm halfway through. it would suck to be in prison. Now i jsut got a random word in my head. disestablishmentariasm. well then moving on. considering my week, its been pretty awful. I almost got mugged, someone got arrested for dealing drugs nearby me on that same night, and i accomplished nothing. i need to become more motivated. not going to school for a year does that to you. I really need to go learn judo. my sheets are looking pretty messy. i must go fold them in 7 minutes. i need to organize my books to and buy some new laundry detergent. Well if i am going to waste my time writing for 20 minutes i might as well make a shopping list. yesterday i watched orange county it was pretty amusing. then i went and did   dance dance.  yeah i really suck at that game. I really have almost nio hand to eye coordination. no wonder i took up pool recently. almost 5 minutes left. i think i should have made myself some green tea before starting this. eh i might go skip the crappy lunchs they serve at the cafeteria and go use my  5 bucks at pizza hut. i like pizza hut. its better than a lot of pizza chains. no pizza beats this one pizza place in greenwich connticut. i used  to walk a a mile to get to eat it when i was `10. those were the days. man my trash is full. i wish we could open our window. this room has a weird smell. must be all the ants i killed. stupid dorm  is infested. i want to go play some pool today. i've been practicing for 3 months straight to beat my brother at it. He took me for some money last time and this time i will dominate. well enough with my  evil plans (insert dr evil laugh). i have 2 minutes remaining and i am still very bored. i need to go take my vitamins. i think i need to buy some good cologne all the after shave i use isn't quite that great. It burns like hell especially since i hate to shave. if there was electrolysis for the face i would do it. well only 30 seconds left. i better save this in case it somehow gets deleted. it turned out to be somewhat fun. well not really. and i'm done. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     So today has completed a very odd and trying week. I have finally gotten to sit in on a full week of school and WOW!!! I seem to find myself asking, have I over done myself? I am taking 15 hours of scool and working 30-35 hours a week and on top of all this I got TWO kittens that require a lot of attention. This, for me, seems like a heavy load because between school and work I have to make sure I am home every three to four hours in order to feed the kittens, but I love them. My roommates seem to have a qiute different approach and feel like I am way out of line and that my life is too busy to begin with to have two little lives depending on me, but what do they know? I am not trying to say I don't take their words into consideration but I believe life is what you make of it and one lives and he/she learns. This is a test for me that I hope I don't fail at but all I keep telling myself is that I must work harder if am am going to succeed( but not too hard=). I am also in the midst of wondering if my mom is doing ok. She found out a month ago that she had 3rd grade ovarian cancer, which is the most advanced cancer cell, and yesterday she had surgery. The doctor said she should be alright but I still worry. I really have no reason to write all this personal information but it feels good to let it all out. All I can conclude is that I have been set a full plate that I now must eat. Besides all the drama I just mentioned I have finnaly declared my major as Child Development/ Pre-Med with a minor in psychology. THis is a huge burden taken off my shoulders which I am very thankful for. I know it will be A LOT of work but I love working with children, but now whether I follow all the way through with Pre- Med is a different story but I know eventually I will get through it and go to Med-School. For right now I need full day just to relax and enjoy myslef, with no one there and no kittens to wake me up every three hours of the night. Another thing I am upset about( which is very trivial) is ther fact that I could have gotten two tickets the the OU game and I passed up the opportunity. There goes a couple hundred dollars I coould have gotten off ebay. Oh well, that's the way life goes. By the way, my boyfriend of three years, Zack, Took me out to a five star resturant last weekend and it was amazing. We had 12 courses in 5 1/2 hours, boy where we full and a little toasty(2 bottles of champaign ahd 12 glasses of assorted wine later). The cool thing is that he works there and our bill was only $60 =). Anyhoot I enjoyed writting and I will see you next time, bye.   "
Tell me about yourself.,"     My roommate just asked me if I have any homework due tomorrow and I don't but yet I still feel as if I need to be reading or studying gor something. I'm afraid I'm doing what I sould be doing, what everybody else is doing, studying. I feel as if my classes aren't hard. I also feel as if everyone knows what they want to do in life and I have no clue. I feel so ashamed that I don't know. Before I came to college, I knew what I wanted to be and do so I was going to come here and work for that goal. I would rather do nothing else but be a teacher. I want to teach so much but there is absolutely no money in it. And thats terrible because teachers can be so influencial. I have had several teachers that have been awesome and make me want to teach even more. I want to help and to influence and to have that feeling that I was a part in that student's recieving and A on a test or a paper. I would want to teach either a math class or biology for highschool students. I was always tutoring and helping my friends or anyone that needed help and I enjoyed it so much. I graduated in a whole year early to get out of highschool. Don't get me wrong, I had a great time in highschool but it was time for me to leave. It was time to start my life. I am in a hurry to grow up, I'm tired of being young. I feel as if I've been the youngest in everything. I was the youngest one at all my family reunions, I was the youngest model. Yeah, I model. It goes on like that for a lot of things. And now I'm the youngest in college, its seems anyway. I graduated early for lots of reasons. Everyone asks me what made me decide to do it and I never really go in to it because I din't like to tell people my sob stories unless I trust them or they know my background. But since I have to write for 20 minutes, I'll tell you. It all got started when my parents got divorced when I was in 8th grade. I really feel as if I had the perfect life if thats even possible. Both my parents got remarried to other people within a year of their divorce. I went through a really hard time then, and I know its completely cliche but I would love it if they got back together. I think they're perfect together. The woman my dad married was a complete idiot. I mean, its sad being 10 times smarter than someone twice your age. But now they're divorced, my dad just wasn't happy with her. I'm happy she's out of the picture. The man my mom married is a big reason I graduated early. I loathe and despise him with a burning passion. I know its immature and selfish, but I will go out of my way to be a bitch to him. I think he's a horrible, miserable man and is completely wrong for my mom. A lot of people say, no youjust don't like him because he's not your dad, blah blah blah. But then they meet him and understand exactly what I mean. I think my mom was a little selfish when I she decided to bring this man into our lives knowing no one liked him. I have this wierd ability to pick out people I know are not good people. My parents had this friend who I hated since I was a little girl, the first day I met him. Later, when I grew up i find out he was a big cocain addict and was always calling my parents to pick him from jail or get him out of whatever mess he got himeself into. I never liked him. I get the same feeling with my step father. I don't even like calling him. I usually refer to him as my mom's husband. I feel so bad about leaving my little brother. He's 9 years old. I hate to leave him with at home with no one to defend him against my step dad. I always stood up for him shen Bert, thats my stepdad's name, would be rediculously rude for no reason. There's sometimes when my mom would step in and say something. My real dad is there, always around doing things with us, don't get me wrong. I have the greatest dad. I feel sorry because my dad is not onw for being alone and I think he's very lonely right now. Especially not that I'm gone, thats one less child for him to be with. I have an older brother too who goes to school at Vasser in New York. He's kind of lonely there right now and he's thinking about coming home and going to school in Texas. I love texas, I wouldn't want to live anywhere else.    "
Tell me about yourself.,"     For labor day weekend I went home and visited my family. I had to go buy a printer today because my the one I have isn't working so my family came with me to help choose which one would be the best for me to have. They made me go to about five different stores so that I could buy the cheapest one, but the cheapest one was in the first store that we went into. I hate shopping and the fact that I had to go to five different stores to realize that the best one was in the first store made me so mad. I'm excited about coming to UT, but it's a culture shock with five hundered people in my class when I'm used to having about twenty-five. It's really exciting being here though. I miss my friends though. I get to e-mail them a lot, but it's not the same as getting to talk to them face to face. I really like the girls in my dorm though. They all seem to be really friendly and nice. I like my roomate too. I was worried that I wouldn't and would be one of those people trying to get information on how to deal with your roomate. I hear the television on in the living room at my grandparent's house. I wonder what they are watching?  I need to figure out how to football tickets for the next UT home game. That would be a lot of fun to go to. I'm kind of stressed out with all this reading I have to for each class. I'm so used to getting worksheets from high school. It's so weird how high school and college are so different. Everybody says that, but you never believe them until you get there. I'm having hard time of thinking of things to write down. I'm getting tired from this. I think I'm going to watch a movie at the theater tonight. I love watching movies that you've never seen before; you never know what's going to happen. I missed my dogs since I've been away from them and that's only been a week. I'm so used to having animals around that it's weird to go to my dorm room and not hear a bark at some point. I have a minature doxen, a whippet, and a mut. I also have three cats, but I'm closer to my dogs. I need to go to Gregory gym and see what exercise classes I can take there. I also need to see if any one will go with me. I think my grandpa is starting to cook supper. It smells like hot dogs or burgers. I hope he doesn't put a lot of spices on whatever he's cooking. I hate it when he does that. I wonder where my grandma is?  She should be back from town by now. Who knows. I need to e-mail my friends again before I forget. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I need to learn better time management skills. I'm so glad that I can finally access all those crazy sites and forums in rhetoric. Oh wow! What's up with that teacher? I do feel sorry for her though. I know what's it like not to be able to do all that technical computer stuff. Afterall, I was only on the computer last night for four hours. And I can't believe I allowed myself to sleep for over an hour and a half this morning! But you know what? I figured out that I can get a lot of work done as long as I do it outside of my dorm room. I also figured out why people say   silence is golden.  (Though personally, I don't mind a little noise every now and then. ) Oh my gosh! I totally found a gift from God today! I was sitting in the study lounge in Jester only to stumble upon a study group for 408k. And it was definitely a blessing to finally get into Teranchi's class. I can't believe Theresa and my new friends are in there. Though the day has seemed slow, that was such a delight. Now I can email Theresa or maybe call up Katherine. (I talked to Katherine today infront of Jesta Pizza and she's taking 408k too. ) I got the phone numbers of two of the girls in the study group and both said they'd be more than welcome to help me with my 408k homework. The only thing I'm not quite sure if it's a plus or not would be the fact that Coco and Rubes are in this new class as well. I'm not sure if I'm at a stage where I could answer questions as I'm trying to learn them myself. And though it sounds kind of bad, I really need to get an 'A' in 408k. Maybe I can review it this weekend and then I might be able to help them next week. Oh wow, next week! I have tests coming out of nowhere! But today was refreshing considering the fact that I'm actually caught up on almost all of my classes. If I can do that in one day. time management here I come! It's pretty pathetic, the little that make you excited. Well once I'm done with this maybe I'll have a better feeling about the rest of my classes because that's one more assignment down. Oh yeah, uh huh! I kind of wish I was a speed reader. I wonder if I'd actually get to party a lot more. Dude, screw the parties me and Henna are going to build a fort. How cool is that? That's just too cool! Oh yeah, we're going to take the pillows from all our friends and were going to throw blankets over them and   POW   there's your fort. Oh and we're going to watch movies in it too! Oh yeah, people that hear about this one. jealous. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Hmm. writing assignment in psychology class. And here I was thinking that this class would be fun and exciting and relaxing, EXCLUDING any sort of writing assignment like the history or english classes. Man I am making so many mistakes as I type, I couldn't possibly be nervous I know that for sure. Oh look, what do you know, only about 1 minute and 30 seconds have gone by; I really don't know if I can keep this up for another 18 minutes or so. I wonder if grammar actually counts, not like I would receive any points on it if I wrote it any slower with a timer right on top of me anyway. Hmm. think I will go back and read this message before I continue any longer. But, I guess that would kind of defy the purpose of writing in a stream of consciousness manner. Stream of consciousness, that term reminds me of my humanities class in 9th and 10th grade. It definitely reminds of James Joyce, the author of Ulysses who attempted to write an ENTIRE BOOK based on the method of stream of consciousness. Man that was quite painful to read, since he didn't use ANY SORT OF PUNCTUATIONS AT ALL. Maybe I'm not supposed to be using any punctuations either. I wonder if I'm destroying the purpose of this experiment. Writing this makes me wonder, can this REALLY be stream of consciousness? There had to have been some premeditation involved one point of another. I'm beginning to feel like my thoughts are premeditated as well. Heck, whatever gets me the credit and grades for this class. Dr. Pennebaker is one hilarious person, good at making fun of people. There is nothing better than public humiliation of individuals who like to stand out among his or her classmates. It is always a good laugh. Well, Friday's almost here, that means another week of my completely wasted college life has gone by. At least I get to go home for this weekend, I'm really sick of consuming the heinously disgusting American food at the Jester buffet or city limits. I'm actually going home for business training. Since I am an independent business owner, I should probably learn some management skills and as well as how to expand all the assets that I have. Speaking of assets, I just recently learned the importance of being able to distinguish between what exactly is an asset and a liability. Robert Kiyosaki is a very, very intelligent man. I guess why he's the multi-millioinaire and I'm not. Oh well, maybe I'll get to his place someday with the help of my friend. Weird, what was I thinking. I could've sworn I was talkin about goin back home for business training earlier. I guess this is what stream of consciousness is all about huh. Man, it seems like it's been forever, but only 10 minutes has gone by. Speaking of time, it reminds me of the different theories that people have developed over their life time. Some people thinks the time goes by faster if they stare at the clock. Personally, I think the clock goes by so much quicker if I'm not constantly staring at it all the time. I wonder how many spelling mistakes I've failed to correct in this writing assignment, oh well. Back to the business training, I hope the ninety dollars were well spent. I really hope that BWW has put together somethin good this year, something that all the BWW/QUIXTAR-Affiliated Independent Business Owner can benefit from. Man that was a pain to type, I probably should've just typed BWW/QUIXTAR IBO's for that matter. Anyways, most of my friends don't seem to believe in the business that I'm participating in, well actually, owning. I don't really get any respect from them at all, and sometimes I really wonder why that is. The only thing I'm waiting to do now is being able to handle my business correctly, expand it large enough so I'll have multi-million dollar returns. And then I think I'm going to come back and laugh at all of the people that has disparaged the activity I was involved in. Even better, the stupid electrical engineers that I call friends can work for me in the future. Just as Robert Kiyosaki says,   an intelligent person hires people who are more intelligent than they are to work for them.  I will be able to prove myself one day. Being able to beat them down is probably the only drive or motivation that exists in my life. Besides Daisy of course, she is the love of my life. Without her, I don't think I would've sanely passed through the toughest times of my life. I'm really hoping to get married to her one day, and make her the happiest woman on the face of this planet by providing her with everything that I possibly can. Looks like I better get rich quick. But, I doubt she's interested in me being rich, I truly believe that she's with me today because it was her choice. She's not the type of person that would regret any decisions she has made in the field of love and relationships, which is something I really respect. She always gives her all, always tries to put on a smile just for me even though she may be having the worst day of her life. I'm so lucky that I've found her, and I'm willing to treasure this relationship for the rest of my life. I cannot really express my love for her in words, nor in sentences, maybe not even an essay of this length. All I can pray for is that someday, she will be able to touch my heart with her hands and fully understands the kind of appreciation that resides within the innermost side of my heart. I thank God everyday for all the things He has bestowed upon me. Of course, besides eternal life, Daisy is the next greatest gift that I have ever received. Oh look, time's up, bye! "
Tell me about yourself.,"   I'm sitting here, listening to the hum of the air conditioner outside my window, on my balcony at University towers and I'm wondering the hell it has to be so damn loud. A better question would be why couldn't they attach it to another outside wall that isn't in the middle of my balcony. I've never felt so bittersweet about a single inanimate object in my life. On the one hand, I adore it because I'm from Chicago and am seriously freaked out by the hellish temperatures and hot wind here. If there was no air conditioning and I had to sit in the heat all day like the bums on the streets, which I've noticed an insane amount of, I'd flip out. Why are there so many bums here?  I don't really know what to do when I pass them because I feel really really bad and want to help, but it's irrational and not possible for me to guive change to each one of them and then there are the questions like what will they do with the money and why aren't they getting off their asses and getting jobs in the first place. I just don't understand why they are so attached to Austin Texas. True, it's an amazing city, much of the reason I am here attending this school. It has music and culture and so many amazing oppurtunities and natural beatuy with two lakes with serene settings and beautiful stars right near by. It just has the worst heat I've ever experienced and I don't see why the bums won't save their change for a bus ticket and go 300 miles north so they don't sweat to death in the heat because they can't buy water and I'm sure that's not what they'd buy if they could buy anything and I really don't understand how their bodies are still living. Which brings me back to my air conditioner which is still humming. It completely ruins the balcony. There is no other place I'd rather sit and have a nice conversation on the phone with my girlfriend at night when it's cooler out or just hang out and smoke and talk with my buddies or some girl I'm trying to hit on than the balcony with an incredible view, but it is completely inhabitable because of this airconditioner and the pigeons and their crap all over it and I sometimes wonder how they fly so high up here because they always look fat and out of shape to me. I think pigeons remind me of chickens or something and that they shouldnt be able to fly. I can't really say why, but it is definitely weird to me that they can make it all the way up here. The Tv's on, we just got digital cable and it's pretty slick except for my dick head roomate is too big of a loser that he can't get any real girls and is forcing us to pay an extra 15 dollars a month for the playboy channel which is completely worthless because all they show is tits and it's soft core. True the girls are prettier, but is it really worth it? I think not. He's a bastard. All he does is sit on the first seat of the couch and flip through the channels all day only to pause on an infomercial and watch that for a half an hour. The kid doesn't move, he's a;ways there and he just sits there and eats food which he has purchased none of and say over and over again no matter what the conversation at hand is,   no man, but it's cool, it's cool.   The only time he's not sitting there bothering me when I bring a girl back late at night and making a fool out of himself and annoying the shit out of us is when he comes back drunk at 3 on a week night and decides he's going to study the one night that I decide to try and get some real sleep. There are 3 rooms in my apartment and he chooses the one with my bed in it, which I am currently occupying and sleeping in order to turn on the lights and sign on the internet and read a book. When I inquired why he was doing this and let him know that I actually was trying to sleep at the time his only respeonse was,   No, it's cool man,   it's cool, I won't keep you up.   As if it's completely normal to sleep with blinding lights on. The time is up and though I wish   I could go on, which I easily could, I'd like to say one last time that my roomate's retarded and so are the bums and thank you for listening, Gentle Creek OUT! "
Tell me about yourself.,"     I FEEL REALLY TIRED NOW. I JUST COMPLETED MY PRE TESTING NOW,. THE TIME IS SO LATE NOW, I WONDER IF I WOULD BE ABLE TO STUDY MY PSYCHOLOGY BOOK TODAY. THERE IS NOBODY IN THE COMPUTER LAB TODAY. I THINK I AM DEVELOPING A HEADACHE. I HAVE SO MANY STUDYING TO DO THIS WEEKEND. I HAVE MY PHYSICS HOMEWORK TO DEAL WITH, MY CALCULUS 3 HOMEWORK TO WORK OUT, MY BIOCHEMISTRY HOMEWORK TO DO. GEES THAT SOUDS LIKE A WHOLE LOT TO DO. TODAY HAS BEING HELL FOR ME. TO START OFF, I LOST MY CREDIT CARD. I WISH I WAS AT HOME RIGHT NOW. I COULD WEAR I SMELL SOETHING BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. I WONDER WHAT MY SISTERS ARE DOING NOW. I AM SURE THEY WANT ME HOME. BHUT I HAVE OTHER PRIORITIES TO TAKE CARE OF, LIKE STUDYING. I HAVE TO DO EXCELLENTLY WELL THIS SEMESTER, TO BRING UP MY GPA AVERAGE. SO FAR I THINK MY CALCULUS CLASS IS GOING ON FINE. My PHYSICS CLASS IS ALSO GOING ON FINE. I WONDER HOW MY LAB WOULD BE LIKE. I HOPE I DO VERY WELL IN THE CLASS. I JUST HAVE FAITH THAT THIS SEMESTER IS GOING TO BE GOOD. I KNOW IT IS. I AM GOING TO TRY AND DO MY BEST. I NEED A GIRL IN MY LIFE. HOW CAN I EVER GET A GIRL, WHEN I AM JUST TO PICKY. WHY NOSA WHY?I JUST CAN HELP THE WAY I FEEL. I MEAN IT IS ME, I CAN'T HELP IT. I AM LOOKING FOR THE PERFECT GIRL, NOT A SUPERFICIAL GIRL, NOT A FAKE GIRL, A REAL, BEAUTIFUL, INTELLIGENT AND FUNNY GIRL. SOMEBODY THAT WOULD MAKE ME LAUGH, SOMEBODY THAT COULD ACCEPT ME FOR WHO I AM. SOMEONE TO LOVE ME MORE THANANYTHING IN THE WORLD, SOMEONE THAT WOULD DIE FOR ME. SOMEONE THAT WOULD LIKE TO GROW OLD WITH ME AND STILL LOVE ME THEN. IF I COULD JUST FIND THAT SPECIAL PERSON, I WOULD BE THE HAPPIEST MAN OF ALL. IS IT TOO MUSH TO ASK FOR. I MEAN I AM A GOOG LOOKING GUY AND QUITE A NICE GUY TOO. WHAT MORE COULD A WOMAN NEED. I AM SWEET. SWEET AS AN APPLE PIE. I KNOW THERE IS SOMEONE OUT THERE FOR ME. MY SOUL IS SEARCHING TO FIND YOU. I JUST HOPE HER SOUL IS SEARCHING FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME. WELL BACK TO REALITY. STUDYING. I GOT TO GO STUDY. I FEEL HUNGRY AND SLEEPY. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     i don't know what to write. I think that the music next door is a little loud, and it always is at least when I'm trying to study. when you are trying to concentrate it always seems as noises are amplified, such as my roommate, studing, every turn of a page is very loud. She is studying biology, which is unusual because usually she complains about having to study, and now she is actually studying. I'm suprised she hasn't yet complained that my typing is bothering her. I hope it's not, but does it really matter. Anyways, I hope this is what I'm supposed to be writing about, and I really hope that grammer and punctuation are not observed too closely. I think it's time for dinner, well really I don't have a choice if I want to eat on campus, since everything closes at 7. It reminds me of my job at a retirement community, where everything closes very early. I wonder how my grades will be at the end of this semester. hopefully good, it's kind of difficult though because UT is so much different than my high school. I mean this class has 500 people tha's more than my entire high school, probably close to twice as big. But, it was my choice to come here and now I must adjust to my new life style. Being in a big city is so much different from a small town, the smell, the people, everything. Rather than the pleasent smell of trees, or the occasional smell of a BarBQ, there is a strong smell of trash and the numerous buses. But, again it is all okay, and with time everything will seem normal. Is that necessarily a good thing, I wonder. What am I going to do after college, no one can tell me what to do with my life, so I have to decide. But should we be forced to decide so soon, i mean we just graduated from high school. there are so many choices and paths to choose, and what if we choose the wrong one, will we be able to turn around and go back. I picked up a package today, my mom sent me some URHA gifts. It's a good thing I actually checked the mail. At home I used to check it everyday, but here I never remember. I miss home, my dogs and my family, but mainly being familiar with everything and everybody. It's difficult to meet people, well at least for me it is. I can't just start talking to someone I don't know, but how will i ever meet anyone that way. the streets are noisy, i think its all the college, probably male, students driving by, engines roaring and music blasting, it's okay if they do that, but i'm trying to think about what I should type. This assignment should be equiped with spell check, that way you would never have to use the backspace button, or key whatever it is called. I really don't know anything about computers, which is kind of sad because my mom works for a computer company. Maybe that's the reason, why do i need to know when i could ask her and she could tell me. I reallt don't know what else to say I'm thinking that I'm glad that time is almost up because there are not any other things to talk about. These desk chairs are quiet uncomfortable, another reason I'm glad time is almost up. I sure have watched the time closely haven't I. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     Today is the anniversary of the attack on the twin towers. i havent been thinking about this all day, images or feelings appear or become evident now and then. I sometimes feel very emotional to the point where my eyes my moisten up, and sometimes I feel a bit angry or nervous, thinking about what the world is coming to. We aren't safe anymore, at least the way we were before the 11th. I mean the nice safe world I lived in two years ago was a comfortable one. I didn't doubt the future of humanity, our country, or our safety. Now, I occasionally do doubt. And most of all, thinking about the 11th and how there seems to be evident hate, extreme hate, towards America, I am angry at the world, at people, I don't know who in particular just angry, that this the world my sister, who is 5 will grow up in. She is a very close part of me, I feel very close and love her very much. She's my   little sis.   And to think that she now has to deal with these new realities of the world and people and her country some day, is sad to me. I mean on ond hand I am thinking come on, nothing drastic is going to happen, you live in Texas far from the events, far from danger, she will be fine, I will be fine. And then I get this sense of coumminty and how we are all in this together and how I am American and she is American and we are hated by people who have the power to kill many people, to infiltrate our country and live among us without recognition. this is bad. Alyssa is her name, and she is so adorable, smart, funny, I would be devistated if anything happened to her, I would feel terrible if she felt scared or hopeless about the new world once she realizes what has happened. I feel that it's partially my responsibility to be there for her and educate her of the events and of the new ideologies that Americans have adopted. I am responsible to help her through these events these new realities as much as I can because I do not want her to fear life. I want so much the perfect, safe, comfortable world I grew up in to be the world she will grow up in, but I face the facts and realize that it most likely will not be. I find myself still in this private world of disbelief or like I am alternating bewteen a world where I realize the new threats involved with Iraq and the possibility of war. Just recently, I started paying close attention to the news coverage of Saddam Hessein and his disregard to UN weapons inspections and how he is a tangible threat to our security. Realizing this, going to war is more of a possibility in my mind. I relize the seriousness of the Iraq conflict, the seriousness of the 11th events, terrorists and all that now more than ever. Maybe because I am older or am paying closer attention to the news, reading more articles in newspapers. Nevertheless, I am bothered by this whole change in our world. I have a lot of homework to do, a girlfriend, tuition and bills to pay, a career to study for, I have plans of becoming a doctor one day and I have just recently realized how much work that is going to be. I never anticipated this much stress or responsibilities in college. I am 20, should this much stuff be present in my life?  You know, I heard Amazing Grace today played at one of the memorial ceremonies on TV tonight and was emotionally moved. That song always does that to me. It can played on the trumpet, piano, organ, or bagpipes-it doenst matter, it always gets to me. I wonder what it is about that song that moves me so much. That was the first song I ever played on the piano and trumpet if I am remembering correctly. I miss my parents, mostly my little sister. I am going back this weekend, but I am starting to contemplate whether or not that is a good idea because I have mcuh homework to finish. I guess thats another struggles I am dealing with in my life currently. I started thinking about how much I love my grandparents. They live right up a little path from our house in San Antonio and I realized that they will not be on this earth for too much longer. I would see them all the time growing up and even through high school. Now I rarely ever see them because I am in college. I will, hopefully, have years and years after their deaths to study or do whatever, is it wise and the best thing for me to miss out on the time I have now to spend with them?  Is spending time in college worth the sacrifice I am making. Why can't I spend as much time with them as possible now when we are here on earth together before they pass on. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     I'M REALLY FULL RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I ATE A LOT OF FOOD TONIGHT. I AS GOING TO GO OUT TO DINNER WITH OTHER FRIENDS, BUT JUST DECIDED NOT TO GO. TE REASON IS THAT IDID'T WANT TO BOTHER THEM. They are all guys, and I didn't want to be the only girl. Anyway, I found out later that there were some other girls coming, but I just eating at that time already. A guy I like went there, too. I was going to go there because of him, but just didn't want to make it obvious taht I wanted to be with him. I am worried that he may not like me, but I'm pretty positive that he at least is interested in me. I was very worried in the biginning, though, because I wanted everything to happen so fast. All my friends advised me not to be that way since the most stable relationship is usually formed after a long time of being together. I guess I'm too impatient and too negative. I envy a lot of people who are positiv and self-confident. They are very proud of who they atr and not afraid of doing anything they want to do. I want to be that way. Sometimes I'm just too scary to start doing anything. However, what is really strange is that I am self-confident. I am usually a leader among my classmates and always think I will do good at most of things. I think I'm not confident of love. Especially, whenever I have somebody I like, I never consider myself worthy for him. Usually, I will think he won't think I'm pretty and so on. All these negative images are pictured in my brain. I do that because I don't want to be so positive, What if I think of all these good things, and they never happen? What if something bad happens? What if he says he doesn't like me? It's much better to think of worse and let good things happen. However, sad thoughts make me really depressed often. I become so biased that I won't see what really is going on. I'd like to be so wise. I don't want to be biased or anything. I guess in order to be wise, I need to read as many books as I can. Also, I think I need more experience. Experience makes one mature and smart. When I was young, I didn't understand why people call the old the wise. However, as I grow, I realized so many things that I now started to understand. The longer I live, the more I see, hear, and think. I am so grateful that I'm still alive and anxious to learn more about the world. There are so many things I don't know, and that fact just makes me go on. I love learning, and sometimes, I get frustrated becuase I feel like there's not enough time for me to know all these things. It's just wonderful to see the world and all there different things within. Different cultures, people, languages,and all these other things are very fascinating. I wonder how and when I will be able to experience everything! It is my dream to travel aroungd the world. I would love to travel and learn many things. I wonder I will be able to get a job and still traveil while working. I hope that can happen. Maybe, I can travel during vacations, but that sounds not enought for me. I will like to travel several times a year. I really think ther's not enough time to see and learn. This is why I try to do more things everyday, but now I'm getting too lazy. College life is exciting, but also make "
Tell me about yourself.,"I needed to do something other than re-write re-writing a paper for   my freshman seminar. Yes, although the new IMac was the   #1   computer for college students,   it has already failed me twice. I   wrote the first copy of my paper yesterday, this morning I dragged   myself in after a long Saturday night to continue where I left off. The   screen was frozen, and my half-way written paper was beyond the   reachable distance between me and my computer screen. My words   are lost in the motherboard of this machine. And then it happened   again. I rewrote the paper, without a harsh-word. In fact, my second   copy was much more to my liking. It made more sense and fit   together. And then I wondered how long my paper was. I have this   tendancy to write in extra small font and single spacing so I'll   surprize myself at how much I've written when i allow myself the   viewing pleasure. When I hit the   paragraph   button, the   application   unexpectedly quit.  This time I allowed myself a splur of profanity   and allowed myself to make a few phone calls, since I'd had such   bad luck I might as well run the long-distance up as well. But since   no one wanted to talk to me, I turned back to the Imac. Not for my   damn paper on the film Matewan again. No, not yet. But for my psych   paper. With my luck this paper will also get lost in the matrix of the   unknown. Those unimaginable invisble power lines, where my   thoughts, words, and fonts flow to any other computer connected to   this wired (and now wireless) world. Now I'm all caught up in these   thoughts about the   deep unknown.  I've confused myself, my study   of psychology and science isn't deep enough for thoughts that   sometimes cross my mind. I should stick to the petty crush I have on   my RA and practicing for my dance tryout tonight. While psychology   is something that really does interest me, I'm not sure why. It's   classified as a science. The science of the mind, I've done my   readings. But I hate science. I hate math. In fact they're my worst   nightmare. Numbers and equations jumble up in my head and I   don't really care about the anatomy of ants or why the sun is so   bright. It just is. I can settle for that. Asking something any deeper is   frightening. No, it's not my   thing.  My thing? That would be visual   performance and art. Specifically, design. The word excites me.  Creation and design could be seen as similar. One could be a   science and one and art, or one in the same. But the science aspect   doesn't thrill me. It's the art. The color and the comfort. I love to   watch, to look, and to experience. Not to calculate. Maybe it's   shallow-that I won't to the shit work. But what's shit work to me is a   dream come true to another. My time runs out and my mind races   too fast to type my thoughts. If my writing is as confusing as it's   made me feel, I blame it on the techno music that my roommate is   blaring. Maybe the IMac doesn't like the music.   "
Tell me about yourself.,"I simply don't know where to start. Having a timer count down how long i have to type is kind of stressful for me. I feel like I have to rush to write enough for twenty minutes. But then, how would the teacher know if I really did type the whole twenty minutes?  What if I was a naturally slow typer?  However, I am a good typer, so I will have plenty of stuff to write. I just got back from my chemistry class, and we learned nothing new. I am surprised at how well I seem to be understanding everything in that class, considering the fact that my high school chemistry teacher was a nutcase. I am like my current chemistry teacher because she teaches things in a nice, normal way, unlike my previous teacher. I learned about the basics more today, like density and specific gravity and all the other good chemistry stuff. On the way back home, however, I learned that my flip flops were not the best type of shoes to walk a long time in because they gave me blisters on the tops of my feet. The plastic that goes into the foamy part of the shoe made a sharp angle and kept rubbing into my skin until it was raw. I am now in pain because I was not very careful when choosing the type of shoe to wear to class. Today was the first day since I arrived in Austin that I have worn shorts. I finally gave in and accepted the fact that it's just too hot here to keep wearing jeans all the time. I felt like I was being a slob because I wore a big t shirt and cotton shorts. I felt like I should be going to the gym instead of chemistry. When I got back home, I saw some people sunbathing in the pool. I wonder why anyone would want to sunbathe now when it is already so hot and sunny all the other days of the week. How odd. I'm relieved that it is Friday--the end of the week. I can now relax and enjoy myself with my friends. Today was also a good day because I finally got internet service, which is why I chose to do my assignment today. I find myself not capitalizing any of my letters that should be capitalized because on AOL instant messenger, I don't need to punctuate or capitalize very well or accurately. My sister just got a call from a friend, and I am wondering who is calling. I really want to know but I can't ask her because she is still talking. From hearing her talk, I think the caller is one of our friends who is in her philosophy class. I am feeling a little hungry right now becuase I ate lunch at noon, and it's been a while since I fed myself. I had a few cheese nips before I started, but I regret leaving them in the kitchen because now I can't eat as I type. Oh well, that's ok because if I did eat while I did this assignment, the keyboard would get all oily and I would not be very pleased with myself. I guess I should eat after finishing this assignment. I see that still have seven minutes to go, so what am I thinking right now? I still feel the pain in my foot from my stupid shoes. I am also excited because I get to hang out with my friends this evening. I might see a movie. Speaking of movies, I am planning on seeing the Robin Williams movie   One Hour Photo   next week with my friends. I am excited because Robing Williams is a good actor, and I enjoy most of his movies. I am kind of apprehensive because it is supposed to be a thriller or scary movie. I hear my printer printing my sister's assignment, and I'm getting annoyed at it because it's so loud. I am wondering why I bought this printer, knowing that it was loud. In the Consumer Reports, it said that the printer was good, but loud, but I bought it anyway because it was cheaper than the one that I was looking at. Maybe I shouldn't have gone the cheap way. Oh well, it's a little late now. What should I eat for dinner?  I want to eat out, instead of cooking for myself because I am lazy and I don't want to make something. I want someone else to do the dirty work and me to enjoy the results. I can't wait until dinnertime, but I can't eat anymore because I have eaten too much already. I am kind of tired today because I had to wake up early to wait for the cable guy. I think I will take a break after this assignment and sleep a little. That would be nice because then I will be refreshed this evening. Yesterday, I couldn't sleep, but I don't know why that was. It might have been the outside noise from people coming and going from the parties around here. I hate the inconsiderate people who don't think about how their noise affects others. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     Hey, well, I am really very nervous, writing down all of my thoughts and feelings on this computer and not in my own personal journal. Because, atleast there I know I will be the only one reading it. But I guess I 'll start writing about what I really have on my mind. My boyfriend and best friend just took off on a long truck ride back home, which is about six and half hours away. They (Jeremiah and Lauren) came to visit this weekend and even though they have only been gone for an hour and fifteen minutes I miss them like crazy! Jeremiah means everything to me and I can't stand the thought of him being five hundred miles away. But then again I decided to come to Texas and not to Tech. Right? Well, that is one thing that is bothering me, the other thing eating away at me is that my new step-mother, who is only four years older than me, is causing some major problems back at home. And on that note it really ticks me off that as soon as I left home she has been on a rampage and really screwing up everything. I feel really helpless because I am over here in Austin and I can't help my sister or my dad go through their problems. I usually stuck up for them when I was home and now I just get to hear about them over the telephone. Which is even more bad because they may or may not be telling me the whole story. I know my dad can handle it but its my kid sister I'm worried about. Jessica, my step mom is such a pain. She is very very, immature for her age and I saw this coming the whole time. I just wish my dad did so he doesn't have to be going thru this right now. I really miss home. I even miss my dog, Homie. I bet he feels like I abandoned him. I was the only one who paid attention to him, but I hope Emily is taking good care of him now. I've only been in school for two weeks and it feels like it should already be november. Sounds pathetic, right? I'm wondering if this was the right decision. I sure hope so. I am a firm believer that God will never give me something that I could not handle by myself. So I just have to take this with a grain of salt and leave it at that. I just wish it was as easy as that. Gosh now it has been one hour and twenty minutes since Jeremiah has left. I keep looking at the clock like he is fixing to get here instead of him being on his way back home. We have become closer ever since I moved. It seems weird saying that but I really mean it. We actually have conversations on the phone, we talk on the internet, and when we see each other it feels like it did when we first started going out, four years ago! It feels great. I love him and I can honestly say that I will marry him one day. Heck, I'd marry him tomorrow if he asked me. He is my best friend and I can tell him anything. He is smart and funny and really good looking. Better yet, he is perfect. He has never cheated on me and always makes me feel like a queen. Sometimes I'm not sure if I deserve him. But I do love him and I always will. It still feels like I'm writing in my diary, although if I was I wouldn't be as consious about typos and mispelled words! I really like this assignment though, it sure beats the chemistry homework I really should be doing right now. I hate chemistry. I hate homework! But it has to be done, right? I often wonder what would happen if I just said to heck with it all and quit. My family would freak. They are so by the book. If anyone was to go out of the norm their whole world collapse. I hope I'm not like that to my kids. I want to be different. I want to make a difference not wait for someone to do it and then say hey I helped them get there. I want to be the one to do something, something special. I just figure out what. I just know that whatever it is Jeremiah is there with me when I do it. You know what? Its hard to type when your nose is running! But I'm almost out of time so I'll keep on typing. I can do it, I can do it! Ha, ha thats kind of funny. Speaking of funny isnt if funny how when your onthe internet you mispell words on purpose and here I am trying really hard not to misspell anything, even when it doesn't matter if the words are mispelled or not. That is bizarre. Remember that song   How Bizarre   I hated it but Jeremiah always sang it and it drove me crazy. Thats funny "
Tell me about yourself.,"It's three thirty in the afternoon right now, and i'm working on my psychology homework. this is a very interesting assignment; i've never done one quite like this. it's actually quite easy--just putting my thoughts on this site and having it timed. quite fascinating. i'm excited today because i finally got my internet and cable installed!! it's been almost 2 weeks since i've been able to watch tv on my own and to use my own internet to get online!! i don't know how i made it, but i'm still alive. hehe. i'm glad that the time-warner people finally got the address right. the first time they came, the went to the wrong apartment complex!! how aggravating!! i've never been more miserable in my entire life!! but today, i'm feeling competely opposite!! ahh. the joys of modern technology. right now, my desk is hurting my arms. since i'm typing, the fleshy part of my arm is getting pushed into the edge of the desk, thus creating a groove in my skin which is sometimes painful. other than that, i'm ok. oh, but my chair is also making impressions on the back of my leg. i'm wearing shorts now so the back of my legs have a cloth pattern on them. my computer is working fine right now, which i am very grateful for. my friend stephen just instant messenged me, but i can't really reply back to him right now since i am doing this writing assignment, which is timed. i feel like i am writing a lot, but perhaps it is because i type fast. hmm. could be. well, i seem to be making many typos. i guess i should slow down and think of what i am writing before i write it. i sometimes get ahead of myself when i am thinking of what to write and it wreaks havoc on my typing. twenty minutes is a long time if you think about it. i mean, i've typed all of this in just seven minutes and twenty three seconds. i'm also trying to figure out which of my friends i should call to help me with the downloading of music. it's the greatest thing on the internet, but somehow i can't get it to work as efficiently as they can. all they have to do to play a song is click the list of songs that they have on the side of their screen, but when i want to play a song, i have to pull up a separate folder. bleh!! so i need to call one of my friends. but who should i call?? let's see. there's stephen, who im'ed me, rex, maria, sarika (she's going home this weekend though), mitra, lindsay (or is it -ey?), maria, her boyfriend zack, her boyfriend's friend stephen, ha, tahera, or jessica. i'm sure i know more people, but i can't think of them right now. the sad thing with the people i just listed is that almost all of them went to the same high school as i did. i need to meet new people. i can't hang out with the same few people every single day. but it's so hard to meet people when the classes have hundreds of people in them each. i go to class sitting next to a different person every single time. i rarely see the same person in my classes. i guess that's what i get for taking all the introductory classes. this stream of consciousness thing is cool. i'm thinking about my syntax (haha. such an ap english 4 word) and it's weird. i never normally talk like this. i feel as though i am babbling to myself or trying to sound intelligent as i babble. i guess i don't talk in an ignorant way, but i feel as though i sound more sophisticated than i really sound in real life. so i might go see a movie with my friends next friday entitled   one hour photo.   the ever so famous robin williams is in the movie, along with the very appealing guy from the hit show alias, michael vartan. the show alias is really cool--this girl named sydney, played by jennifer garner, is this spy/counterspy and she does all this cool stuff with all her high tech gadgets. and michael vartan plays her handler. now i'm talking on the phone with my friend maria. she called about what we want to do tonight. so we might play monopoly. apparently rex brought monopoly. or maybe it's rex who has it. i don't know. all i know is that now i have to call rex and see if he wants to play monolopy after his chinese bible study thing. i went to this chinese/taiwanese association thing the other night, and i felt so white-washed. that means that i don't feel like i'm as asian as them. i guess that could be a bad thing, but it probably was because half of those people were fobbish. fobbish means that they just got to the states so they're still really foreign-like. it kind of makes them stand out, but if they're ok with it, then it doesn't matter. i'm almost finished!! woohoo!! now i have to go call rex and see what we're doing tonight. good bye! "
Tell me about yourself.,"     I am wondering how I am going to type because I do not type very well. I also think that you are going to think that i am stupid for misspelling words and what not. i feel anxious. i do not know why. i feel stressed beyond belief. i want to got to sleep right now. i am wondering what i am going to type next. i try to write in journals but when i write about my feelings i go off on tangents, like writing my stream of concsiousness (however you spell it) i feel as though my mind goes a mile a minute and i want o verbalize, write/type, etc what i feel or think but i think that my body is too slow. like i start to studder, or i am not able to formulate my thoughts completely, i don't type fast to keep up with my thoughts. i have a fear about writing, i do not know why. some insecurity i must have developed and know it makes me really nervous to the point of where i begin to sweat and feel . i do not know?   today was the yr anniv of 9/11, i thought it weird that one of my prof kept referring sept. 11 as 9-1-1. i thought how strange is that, how strange that prof is in general. there is osmething about her that is really weird. i hate to be so judgemental, but there is somethiing weird there.    i had a wonderful conversation with my mother today it was great, i love her  we talked for about an hour. i talked about my fears and growth as a person. she seemed truely interested in me. i feel that people are not interested in me (except my bf, but he gets on my nerves)  like i talk to people and i want to get to know them, i ask questions, and people just love to talk about themselves, but as for me, i do to, but no one seems to care (except my annoying bf, he seems to want to know everything down to the second. this is him calling me right know on my mobile, how weird!!!!   i told you. he wants to talk to me every five seconds, he is like a girl or something, always wanting to know what the hell you are doing.  i hope this has spell check on it because i know i have probably mispelled a lot of words. don't you hate it when someone sends you an email or something and there is a mispelled word on it?  i feel really embarressed for that person, so i never want that to happen to me so I always spell check, but i guess i can't this time. i am not that stupid. or am i?   well i have about 2 min left, it wasn't that painful   i thought i was going to be staring at a blank screen wondering what the hell to write. the 20 mins went by really quickly 10, 9, 8,7,6, 5,4,3,2,1 yea!!!!!  its over!  not bad, eh?  enjoy   "
Tell me about yourself.,"     My mind is blank right now. I'm doing this late so i'm nervous that it won't count for credit. i went swimming today, but i wish i hadn't because then this would be on time. sometimes i get homesick, i called my mom today and she was talking about my cousin's wedding. she was surprised that i was willing to pay for my plane ticket there. i think i would regret it if  i didn't go. i've never been to boston before. i hear that it's very historical. I guess they have good clam chowder there, that's what people say. I like clam chowder, but i've only had the kind that comes in a can, so i guess i haven't had real clam chowder. i like a lot of foods from a can. people laugh at me because i still like spaghetti-o's. oh well. they laugh at a lot of things I eat. I really hope this counts for credit. It's only an hour late. I can't believe I forgot, I'm usually so good with homework. If it doesn't count, at least i can still try to get good grades on everything else and maybe i can still get an A. i have to try really hard, i guess even harder now that i realize i am forgetting things, but i want to go to graduate school to get my Ph. D. in psychology. so hopefully i'll start remembering to do all my homework. i've been pretty good with keeping up with the reading in all my classes, but it's a lot of reading. i knew college would be a lot more work than high school, but i never imagined all the reading. i'm actually enjoying this writing assignment, i haven't written in a journal or anything in a long time. it feels good to get things out. i used to write poetry too. that made me feel a lot better when i was sad. usually it had to do with guys. they always find a way to make me feel bad. it felt good to be able to turn something bad into something good. i should get back into writing poetry, maybe someday it'll actually be good. i only let a couple people read it and they said they were good, but you never know if they're just saying that or not. i like a couple of them but i usually eventually decide that they're not very good after a while. my two favorite ones are lost somewhere. that really upsets me. i wrote them on a plane. i know i didn't lose them on the plane but when i packed to move here, i still couldn't find them. i wrote them in a spiral but i have a lot of half used spirals. i hope nobody took it. i don't like it when people read my poems. only if i show them and even then it's hard. i don't know why, i  guess it's because they're so personal, it's like i'm completely open and vulnerable when people read my poems. they read my most personal thoughts when they read them. except for a few, some thoughts i just don't put on paper. some things that i'm really not proud of would really not be best on paper because then i'd have to look at them again, or someone else could read it. my parents go through my sister's stuff sometimes, so i assume that they go through mine too. i hope the don't find the pictures from the party at my house. i forgot to bring those and they would probably cut me off if they knew i had a party there. it was fun though. that was the best party. everyone said so, so i know it wasn't just me who had fun. people were dancing and everything and everyone was getting along, usually somebody gets in a fight at parties. boys are so stupid. wouldn't that be a funny last sentence? that seems to be a pretty good conclusion though. it always seems to come around to that.

Tell me about yourself.,"I have never had an asignment like this before. It is hot in my dorm room. I always feel sweaty especially at night. It is difficult to sleep. Now that we are a few weeks in to school I can feel my self getting more and more stressed out every day. The workload is quit large, and I never have enough time to do everything i need to do. Actually right now I am between classes but i only have and hour to do this assignment, do some calculus, and eat lunch. I know I won't do one of those three. I probably won't eat lunch. Even though I am starving. i went to today and got a wristband for the OU game. The draw for tickets is tommorrow morning so i guess i am going to miss class to stand in line. If i do that and don't get a ticket i will not be happy. I wander where my girlfiend is right now i havnt seen her at all today. We live in the same building and I still rarely see her. Usually only at night, and even then we study so we don't talk much. I miss all the time we spent together when we still lived at home. We both went greek so between her sorority my fraternity and school there is maybe 30 min a day left for just talking to each other. Hopefully things will get easier later on in the semester. I live at Dobie so i have three roommates, and one of them is trying to teach himself the guitar. I am really sick of hearing his stupid guitar. Plus he sucks at it. i just accidentally pushed the back button on my computer, and when i pushed forward what i had already typed was still here but the timer started over. I wonder if that matters. I don't have time to keep tying for another twenty minutes. I am serously considering not going to my next class. I just want to eat lunch and take a nap. I just realized something funny my next class is pyschology. Oh well just because i am doing the assignment doesn't mean i have the energy to go to class. Who am i kidding i am to worried about missing something important so i will go even though i am really tired. During the last lecture i fell asleep for about 10 minutes and woke up really confused. I have so much work i have to get done before friday. Which wouldn't be that big of a problem but my fraternity has something going on every night this week, and since i am a pledge i am expected to be there. My time is just about up so i am going to stop typing now. "
Tell me about yourself.,"In about 30 minutes I have to start getting ready for work. I don't want to go, but I need to make money so I can go out. My mom called me yesterday and said that my bank account was getting low and she wanted to know what I was spending it on. I was supposed to use the money for a stereo, but it's amazing how fast five hundred dollars can go in Austin. I love Austin so far. Tonight I'm going to a Corry Morrow concert. I should probably stay home and study, but I would like to meet more people in Austin too, so I'll probably still go. My mom also griped at me about how I need to study more. I just spent seven dollars today on washing clothes. This makes me mad because I can think of much better things to do with my money besides wash clothes. Four loads of clothes costs seven dollars. How ridiculous. I'm going home on Saturday because one of my friends is turning nineteen and they are having a party for him. I just went back home like two weeks ago, but I don't want to miss his birthday. I can't wait to see everyone from back home. My roommate is cooking her some Roman noodles and I can't decide if I want to eat some or not. I don't think so. I really wanted to lay out by the pool today, because I really need to get a tan, but I spent the whole day cleaning house and washing clothes. What fun! I haven't gotten any of my checks in from work yet and it's making me wonder because I have been working there for a while now and only one check so far has come in. I guess they don't realize I'm a college student and I need money as soon as possible. I really want to get a tattoo and that is probably the main reason I want my checks to start coming in. If my mom knew that I wanted a tattoo she would kill me. Oh well, I'll keep it a secret for a while, and then by the time she finds out it will have already been a long time since I got it. My roommate wants one too, but she's already talked to her mom about it. I really need to go to an audio store because my system in my car stopped working and I can't stand not having bass when I listen to music. It better get done soon. I really need to read this book for a freshmen seminar class I have. The book is pretty boring, but it's easy reading so I guess I'll survive. I'm really dreading going to work in a minute. I wish I could just skip to tonight and go out already. That just sounds so much more appealing! I have to go to the bathroom, but I guess I'm not supposed to because I have to sit here and keep typing my thoughts. My roommate has the T. V. on and it's kind of hard for me to keep my train of thought, but I guess that is the whole point to just write down everything that is going through your head. The drive home on Saturday is going to be so long, but it will be worth it I guess because it is going to be so much fun. It feels so nice to have a clean house. I just cleaned my room for the first time in about a week and it was getting pretty bad. My roommates boyfriend is sleeping right now and I have the music pretty loud. I should probably turn it down. We went out last night. We went to someone's apartment and it wasn't that fun. Oh yeah! I forgot the cops came. Good thing they weren't coming for us thought because that would have sucked if the party would have been broken up. I didn't even swim with everyone else because I didn't bring my bathing suit. I hope I remember to bring it next time because it looked really fun to sit in the hot tub. I'm fixing to pee in my pants. I wish this timer would hurry up and run out. I just took that pretest for the experimental requirement too and that had to be the longest testing thing I have ever taken. I didn't think it was ever going to end. I guess the hour and a half of credit they give you for doing it is well worth it. I'm getting pretty nervous about all the tests that are coming up. It seems like they are all during the same week. That is  going to kill me I just know it. The more I think about those tests the more I think I should probably stay home tonight. Naa! I'll just go out. I find myself saying that more and more when I really need to stay home and study. I have to do good this semester though so I can keep my scholarships. I can't remember what GPA I have to have to keep them. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Gone with the wind I am and away I look out into the empty space of eternity with nothing. I awake into the morning darkness hearing the buzzing noises and look at thee General Electric alarm and press snooze while i squeeze in 1 hour of extra sleep. I watch tv and walk the whole day and then i go shit in my public restroom with feces flowing from my colon down to the toilet. Oh yeah i say as I struggle. I often have a tough time. No, i don't. I don't know why I am saying that. I brush my teeth and develop anger and excitement at the same time. Anger for what i ask to me as i am me but do not know who you are. Who are you and why do you exist i say? Then i look out the window and see big yellow neon lights expressing Wells Fargo. I take a shower with no showerhead pressure and I get pissed off! I want nice warm water and a nice showerhead. The force is strong as I see red marks become apparent on my not so hairy chest. I get the urge for herbal essence but see to see that I do not have any. Do you have the urge to say   oh yes?   I am away and out of the blue and in the light of things there is nothing. Darkness exists as a prerequisite of life. What is this   doh   Homer Simpson says. Donuts and coffee i must have soon. Soon enough to satisfy my craving for IHOP pancakes and a nice morning breakfeast at a nice restaurant. I go down the elevator. Stupid ignorant people who live on the first five floors are too lazy to walk down the stairs. I had a firedrill today. How annoying the pulsating noise was. And how tiring. I could not imagine how firefighters climbed up to 78 floors on that clear, but smoggy morning on September 11, 2001. My love for skyscrapers has grown more and more. Everyday, my passion and desire to see new and taller buildings arise grows larger and larger! I wait to see what will be done with the hollowed ground-zero. Perhaps nothing will be built, but i hope for something. Tennis is a very vigorous sport. The agility and the swift hits of the nice yellow ball that i throw around to my dog with. Oh I love my dog. Nice gold fur blows in the wind as i see a slow motion love seen in the mix of progress and then he starts to hump me. Humpty dumpty sat on a wall. but then he fell off. I forgot how the riddle goes. The itsy bitsy spider climbed up to window is it? Who cares? Not me, for I am no longer in kindergarten but in college, the USA's largest college-UT! WhoohooO! I have the urge to get drunk perhaps maybe have fucking good sex. Perhaps smoke something illegal or not? My room-mate has just farted and he says sorry. I don't care. The smell is of essence. Nice allure should be made into such a fragrance and entitled El Natura. Body works in different ways. My stomach is hurting. I have been having a bloating stomach the whole day. It is like a balloon filled not with oxygen, but with helium. If i could only float in the air and swim in the sea. Fly up in the air. Perhaps the ultimate luxury would be to eat tabasco flavored cheeze-its when I am perhaps   high   in the sky. Oh yeah. good 'ol times rock on forever. Forever i must live like that. Drunken little bastard i must be during this year. Ambitions thrive to do well, but will I? Parents constantly pester me with Do well in class viju-baba. Please do well. Of course the usual response is the usual for almost everyone else.  I will,   comes out of my mouth. Deep inside i have the heart to do whatever I want, but it is the concentration that I lack. I do not like being forced to do something that I do not agree with. It is simply at its upright most stupidity. Stupid is as stupid can be but who is stupider than stupid? Everyone is judged at different levels. Ignorance is bliss honey. Bee's fly around. I have never been stung by a bee or wasp. Speaking of being stung, I like the singer Sting. He is a good singer. Anyways, speaking of other things, i think things are the way that things are and that things should be left to the way that things should be. WHY? because they are things that obey other things, not stuff. Yes. I need to pee, but must I? Flaming whopper commercial's thrive in the background of my head as i feel the urge for el penetrado. Oh yeah. The music is playing and I must go now. Bye bye and bye!         "
Tell me about yourself.,"Oh no!  I wasn't ready!  Oh well!  This seems weird to me to write what I think. I think very random things. I really like school here but miss my family. My roommate is going out tonight and she looks cute. It is some kind of formal for a frat. I don't like the frats here. The boys make me feel uncomfortable. A lot of guys do that though. They don't seem to notice me in any way. It is kind of weird. All this time I thought it would be better once I got to college and the guys would notice me, but nothing has really changed. They all still see me as a cute friend girl. But I am beginning to accept and like that. I am beginning to kind of like being   one of the guys  !  Oh poot! I forgot to put an away message on my Instant Messenger. I hope no one IMs me. Maybe I should do that. It will only take a sec. Okay!  Done!  It feels like time is passing so slowly as I type. Maybe it is because I want this to be over with. I feel like I type a lot slower than I thought. At least I use all my fingers and not just my pointers. I feel sorry for the people that do that. If I were to keep thinking in this way, will whoever reads this think I am a huge loser?  Am I a loser anyway for doing this assignment almost 2 weeks before it is due?  Wait, I think it is two weeks and one day away from being due. Or 2 weeks and 2 days!  I think. Maybe I don't even know the due date and am just getting ahead. I think that is right. I just scratched the scab on my arm and it hurt. I don't know how it got there. I feel like such a little kid!  I fall all the time and have bruises all over my arms and legs and scabs on my elbows and knees. I am such a clutz!  I need to adjust my screen because it is getting hard for me to see what I am writing. I hope I am not misspelling any words. I am not the best speller, and when I am typing it gets worse. I always spell because-   BECASUE  . It is terrible. I think people rely on computers too much to fix their mistakes for them. We now even can talk on the phone through the internet and stuff. That can help us fix relationship problems. My roommate is putting lotion on. She makes me laugh a lot!  Actually it isn't hard to do. But the funniest person is my brother in law Jeremy. He is so hilarious. All he has to do is say one word and I will bust out laughing. I wish that I could be that funny. Laughing makes people feel good!  My cousin used to say that it makes you live longer to laugh. I wonder if she is right. She laughs even more than me!  My roommate just sneezed and I laughed because she did!  See!  I just had to go back and fix because, because I spelled it wrong!  Anyway!  Back to my cousin. She has become my best friend. (or at least one of them)  I miss her a lot. Arlington and Austin are far from each other and since she is only 16 it is hard for her to be allowed to come down here without her parents throwing a fit. They probably are worried about me. I sent them an email today because my aunt is a teacher at Mansfield's SUmmit, and she used to teach at Grapevine High School, and I met a guy that had her as a teacher. He goes to South West Texas. That is only 30 minutes away!  I am developing feelings for him. I went out with 11 boys on Friday, and I was the only girl. Ryan, the boy, was there too, and we hung out a lot of the time. He is really a great guy. I want to get to know him better. I saw him last night at our friend's house that introduced us, and he barely talked to me. I tryed to talk to him, and he was, I think, trying to talk to me, but this girl named Cassidy kept interfering. She goes to OSU and came down for the weekend to see all her   best friends  . Whatever. She kept keeping him from talking to me. He told me to follow him around at one part. He made me laugh a lot. I really like it when guys make me laugh. Another thing is that he makes me feel comfortable around him, like I have known him for a long time. That is another thing I look for in guys. Being comfortable and laughing is a good combination of things to be. It makes me happy. My roommate is talking to her sister right now, and it makes me miss my sisters. They are both older than me and I miss them. I actually hung out with them all day today, so I don't know why I miss them. I love them a whole lot. It is amazing how when we grow up, we all become closer even though we are 3 and 6 years apart. I guess growing up makes everything between my family better!  Blake Felix is not cute and Sarah is crushing on him and she made fun of me. Jake Anderton is such a liar and a big jerk. I don't know what made me think I would have fun with him. HELLO!!  Differing personalities TOTALLY!!  I like musicals, for instance, and he doesn't know a thing about them. I want to be an actress one day, speaking of musicals, and I would love to do a show on Broadway!  I want to go to LA, though, first. That would be awesome to make a movie. Courtney and her sister are even getting closer like my sisters are. WOAH!  That was totally off subject. I think it is because I am now writing this and listening to Courtney talk. That is hard to do. Kind of like listening to music and studying. It is hard. TIME UP! "
Tell me about yourself.,"     I'm very worried about many things right now. I feel that i'm so far behind in my studies that i won't be able to catch up. I haven't gotten all my books and my classes are fairly hard this year. I'm usually a guy that stays on top of things and likes to have the headstart, but it seems like I'm not on top of things. I have to get my microeconomic book from my friend later tonight so i can begin reading for that class. I should be on chapter three already, but i have yet to begun. I'm in Houston right now, my hometown, and is about to leave around four. Home was a nice time to relax and enjoy my old friends again. Most of the time I was home finding myself doing absolutely nothing. I find that Houston is not as fun as it was. Things are starting to change. My views and my emotions are quite different than before. I view my parents and my brother differently. I appreciate their company more than i did before. I guess I just miss them an awful lot. My brother and I are very close, and i try to talk to him every night when i'm not living in Houston. I enjoy talking to him and sharing my thoughts and my experiences. I'm also kind of glad that I am going back to Austin later today. I missed alot while I was gone. A friend's birthday party, UT's first football game, and a Chinese Bible Study meeting that i was hoping to attend. I can gladly say that I don't regret comming to Houston and being back home. I enjoyed it fairly well. Suddenly, I feel like a sense of burden lifted from my shoulder. I'm not really thinking about my school work and homework that I should be doing, but I have a smile on my face. A sense of peace and a sense of sadness that I'm going to depart from this wonderful place I call home. Both my parents are home right now and my mom is making her best dishes for me. I can smell it from upstairs. I haven't quite missed my mother's cooking yet, but i know i will in the comming months. University of Texas is not what I had in mind. It is not as fun and exciting as I thought it would be. All my friends go there, but there seems to still be an emptiness. I guess things will get better as time progresses. I'm still not use to the freedom that I have and still not use to other things. I have also found out that I have not spoken to many of my close friends, or even hung out with them. I rather just be around those that I feel more comfortable around. The people at UT are nice thus far, I have met variety of new faces and do throughly enjoy their company. I enjoy making new friends and meeting new people. I have learned that friendships are very important. Since I use to move alot, from places to places, I have learned how to make friends and still be myself. I feel like I have lost a good friend of mine from high-school. I was very close to him and we were like brothers. Now, in college, it seems like he doesn't even want to hang out with me, but rather with his girlfriend. My friend has never dated before, but now is dating. He spends alot of time with her, and does various activities with her that i strongly disapprove. I really want him to continue to be my friend, but it just seems so hard when he doesn't put his efforts into the friendship. I hope this is not the end of our friendship, and i'm not going to give up on it. College will be a time for me to learn and expererience things that I will never experience before. Sceanarios that i have no idea how to solve and trials that will make me into the future Nick Chu. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I really don't know what the heck this is all about but i guess I will just write stupid stuff that I am thinking about. I am a really slow typer and whenever I am being timed on something it makes me nervous and I mess up a lot. So, if someone is reading this I am sorry if i make a lot of mistakes. I have a ton to do toinght and i really want to go to bed early because i have a 9 o'clock class in the morning. as soon as i get finished with this, i need tot call this girl in my physical science class and get our lab assignment from her becasue i didnt have my book last time. that is going to be really difficult because i don't have her number. hopefull i can call around and get it form somebody. She is in my sorority so it isnt completely hopelss. my roommate is watching this movie that is really gettign on my nerves. the people are making these shorrible dieing noises. it sounds so gross. anyways, back to my to do list for tonght: after i do that i need to go pick all of that stuff up and tranfer all of our data to my book which will take forever and i have only been writing for 6 minutes and i really feel like this is a waste of my busy night but thats ok a t least i am getting it over with. I am so glad that is due this friday. for some reason i had it written down that it was due last friday and i was really mad this morning when i thought i had missed turning this in. because these are easy points that i definately need. i love classes that give you extra things besides tests because i am not always te best test taker, so anything extra really helps. i really like peenebaker a lot, except he goes really fast through the material and i get kindof lost, but thats why i like the discussion sessions. i really think that those are going to help me. i am froma small high school and so i am used to small classes so those discussions are very comfortable for me. i am from midland and i think on the first day that he said he was from midland but i couldnt really hear him. i know he made a comment about midland vs. odessa an i  liked that one. i hate it when people always try to lump them together. it really gets on my nerves because they are so different. i went home to midland this last weekend because i got ina wreck on friday night. it really sucked because that was my fiirst wreck. i just backed into someone so it wasnt a big deal nut i think that it is going to be really expensive. it is getting really hard for me to concentrate because i am listening to one of my roommates talk ont eh phone and i keep gettig distracted and wanting to type what she is saying. oh my ogsh- its only been 13 miutes. this is insane. i don't know how much more of this i can take. my wrists are starting to hurt. oh now he getting off the phone. now i got really distracted because she was trrying to talk to me and now i have totally lost my train of htought which hass probaba;y defeating the whole purpose of this writing assignment. oh well. see now i can't think of anything to talk about. oh yes about going home this weekend. i had a wreck so i went to show my dad my car and ( i just got distracted again) and i went to my sisters football game. she is a cheerleader and this was her first varsity game to cheer at. she is a sophomore. i remember my first varsity game. i was so nervous. i was a freshman though. my year they let freshman try out for varsity bacuse of some conflicts the year before. so me and one other girl were the only girls ever to be on varsity for four years. it was kindof cool. i letter four years in a row. i was the only one that graduated a four year letterman because karah(hte other girl) quit her senior year. it was really sad. oh yeah i only have 30 more seconds left. i am so glad that this is almost ov        "
Tell me about yourself.,"Here I go, frist off let me think of a topic, how about looking at a country side in the Texas hill conutry. Useraly the frist thing I notce are the ceder trees, and while I like trees, there is something upsetting about ceder trees; they are not native to this part of the country, however they are well adattined to this climet. Sence ceder trees are evergeens they can feed themselfs all year round, which gives them avantivce over the trees that grow here naturaly, such as oaks and jupaters. Oaks and jupaters lost thier leaves in the fall, and both species of trees grow very slowly; aposed to ceder wich grow very fast. Thus the ceder trees have drowed out most of the oak and other native trees. This is upsetting to me because, while ceder forest is nice to look at, it is no where as impressive as an forest made up of old mujestic oaks and jupaters with there beatifull puple and white blossmues. Another thing about ceder is they grow close together and low to the ground, which makes it very hard to walk around in a ceder woolden area. Just think how great it would be to walk aroud in a forest of huge old oak trees over your head, that pervade shade, while still leting a cool wind througt. Yes, it would cerncely make the rolling hills of the hill conutry more beatuifull, and would surely enhace my beatitude, while walking through the woolds.      "
Tell me about yourself.,"     I just got done taking a shower in the hopes that it would wake me up so I could read the things I need to read for my classes. The shower sure did wake me up! A girl living on my floor, whom I have never seen before, took all the best shower, along with all the hot water. So it took me twice as long to take a shower, which made me mad. This anger added onto my frustration from my homework tonight. So now I am here, listening to music and writing my   stream of consciousness   because I figured that this would be the best time since I have multiple feelings in me right now. In addition to the anger from the shower incident and the frustration from the class homework assignments, my friend brought up a topic that made me recall past emotions. He recently is   taking a break   with his girlfriend, and he has been telling me that he is sad and lonely, but the break was mutual. I told him,   yeah, I know what you mean. I had to end things with a guy, but it was not mutual.  So instead of just acknowledging it and moving on, he asked questions about my relationship with this past guy. It took me a long time to forget the experiences dealing with him. Talking about them just made me a little sad. Like I said, the break was really bad, so bad that I felt like there was no one who could understand what I was going through, no one could help me because this was the way my life situation is and no one can fix it. Strict parents cannot be changed on their beliefs. Anyway, I tried to shrug the subject away by bringing up other topics, and soon enough we were laughing over some dumb internet site that he sent to me. If only I could help him out with his sadness, but I know time is all he needs to realize that this girl he's been with is not the only girl out there. A   break   from a relationship will either make the bond stronger, or one will come to the realization that a world of opportunity is out there. I am content that I have no one tying me down, but I do miss the boyfriend/girlfriend relationship. If I do meet someone, then that is fine. If I do not, then that is fine too. When I entered college I promised myself that I would make smart, sensible decisions and still have fun in the process. A huge group of guy friends is way better than one boyfriend in my opinion. I have not even met at least five new people in all of my classes for crying out loud!   There are plenty of fish in the sea.  Yes, college is great so far; I recently joined kung fu. It feels so good to be doing something you love again. I had to quit due to, once again, strict parents, but now that I'm back in the sport, the stress is less. I love watching it, and there are really athletic people in the class too. Martial arts has always been a big interest to me. To be one of the few girls in the kung fu class is another bonus. Not only am I surrounded by athletic guys, I also feel like I am special in a way, like I am unique. And I am better than most of the guys already. Flexiblity and grace is key in wu shu kung fu, and I've got them both. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     I was fairly apprehensive about beginning this assignment, as it is my first official college homework. I'm a little worried that I won't be able to fill the entire twenty minutes with my thoughts, however I've never had a lack of thought before, never been at a loss of something interesting or intriguing to ponder or speak about. However, I've also never been asked to trace my stream of thought for twenty minutes. Right now I'm feeling pretty tired and I guess a little thirsty. But I guess that's life. Life is also a board game by Parker Brothers, you know, the one where you buy 'House Insurace'. Life is sitting at my computer completing an assignment for one of my classes. Life can be a many number of things, such as a pony ride in Illinois, a state I've been to once to see Lincoln's birthplace but have no desire to return to. Abe was our 16th president, something I remember from AP US History. It was the best class I ever took in highschool. I haven't been on a pony ride in years. The girl across the hall from me in my dorm used to train horses though, and she talks of them semi-frequently. My roomate does a lot of studying. I'd say upwards of six or seven hours each day. It makes me feel guilty that I am not always making the best use of my time, but I figure that's what college is about. Not specifically wasting time however, because it in itself is definately not a waste. I'm almost done with classes for the week, just a philosophy discussion section tomorrow from 1-2. It's nice to only have one class on fridays, however I am disappointed that I got assigned that scetion. A 3-day weekend each week would be much appreciated, which I suppose goes without saying. My boyfriend is coming into town this weekend, which is nice. He attends the Texas Agricultural and Mechanical University (Texas A&M). Most people are shocked to dicover that I'm dating an Aggie. I guess I just haven't become a die-hard Longhorn fan, as of yet anyway, although I know I will never sever a relationship (as some people think I most definately should) over school pride and - or rivalry. I will however attend the UT/A&M game and probably wear orange. I will also eat some yogurt and get a lemonade as soon as these four minutes are up. I need to put some more of my photos up in my room. My roommate has put some up. They're small Van Gogh prints, which is my favorite. I'm pretty passionate about art, I did a lot of reading this summer on the history and pecific time periods of western art. However, my roommate just put them up for their aesthetic value. Oh well, you can't win them all. Most though, anyway.      "
Tell me about yourself.,"     I've been thinking about relationships lately. As we speak my mind is bewildered with thoughts of my ex-girlfriend that i was with for over a year, and the new girl im dating. Im still friends with my ex, but she still loves me and im not in love with her any longer. This new girl means the world to me, she is a nice change of pace for me. It's something new and I like it, but I can't help but still have feelings for my ex. I think the reason is because I was in a sexual relationship with her for a year, my first sexual partner. And I think that keeps me tied to her in a way. And the problem is when I'm with this new girl, I'm very turned on and want to be with her sexually but for some reason I can not get aroused, if you nkow what I mean. It's not that I don't want to, because I do, but for some reason I'm just not able to. I wonder why this is? Why can't I just have another healthy sexual relationship with this new girl. Is it me? What can I do to fix the problem? Should I just stop thinking about it and eventually it will pass over time? Or will this be a chronic thing? Im in a bind because I don't want to offend this new girl by not getting aroused with her. I don't want her to think I'm not attracted to her. God, I can't wait to see her! She lives in Dallas still, she's a year younger, so I can only go back in town on occasion to see her, and what makes it even worse is the temptation from my ex, because she goes to college here with me. And she has already taken advantage of me when I was drunk. Should I tell this new girl this? What good would it do? I'm not going to volunteer the information to her, but if she asked me I definitley wouldn't lie to her. When I broke up with my ex I wanted to be free, I mean I was going to college and I wanted to see what possibilities there were for me without the weight of a girl friend on my back. But then just a week after we broke up, I found her!! And she makes me want to go back to a relationship state. She likes me how I am, but I like to try and impress her as much as I can. I find myself spending  a lot of moeny on her! Plus, I'm taking a weight lifting class here to make myself look better, not just for her, but myself too, but I definitley want it for her because I know she would like to see me with more muscles. She's so beautiful! Her face pops up in my head everyday. I see her face on everyone I meet! Am I in love again? I hope not. I don't want to fall in love with someone I can't be with do to where we live. That would hurt too much. I have to be close to the person i love. So I will not let myself fall in love again. I can't let it happen. But I'm afraid it will, I know she is falling in love with me, but I got to hold back. I got to be strong. I can't wait till I go back in town in october. I'm taking her out to a haunted house, I love them , she hates them. Meaning she will be clinging to me like white on bread. I love when she puts her arms around me. I love when we're fooling around she takes my shirt off. She's very aggressive. . . god I love that. An aggressive woman is very attractive in my eyes, a woman who will take control is somethign rare, and she posesses it. I so want to get more physical with her, but I'm afraid because you see, she's a virgin. . . I'm not. I don't want to steal her innocence. She's so sweet and innocent, I don't want to corrupt that, especially when I don't know if there is a definite future for she and I. What do I do? I think she wants to have sex because of all the signals she gives me when we're fooling around but I'm not too sure. Do I go ahead and go for it? Or will that just make me fall in love with her, which I stated before I didn't want to do. Man, she makes me so jealous! I have never been jealous, but for some reason she makes me. I guess it might be because I'm not there with her, and i know she hangs out with all these guys, and osmetimes its just her and a guy. That pisses me off, I mean I trust her, but one of the guys she hangs out with is an ex-boyfriend of hers, who makes it very clear that he is still madly in love with her. So how am I suppsoe to take that? god!! I wish I wasn't jealous, I mean she and I are just dating and I'm already this jealous. I was never this jealous in my entire previous relationship. She makes me so happy though. She can do nothing wrong! She is my everything and I think about her constantly! I think I love her! "
Tell me about yourself.,"     Well, all I have to say is that it is very hot in here. The air conditioner is broken, and beads of sweat are trickling from the back of my neck down into my chair. I hate being hot. I would so much rather be cold than hot. However, I could never live in a really cold environment. Texas is my home. I would have to kill myself if I lived in Michigan or something like that. Just imagine, waking up at 6am to go to work, and having your car door frozen shut. That is my hell. I think the perfect place to live would be California, Southern Florida, or of course Hawaii. I am going to be one of those old people who move to the beach when they retire. My husband will have one of those fishing businesses where he takes tourists out for a fish in the ocean, and I get to laze around the pool all day. My grandchildren will come and visit me, because it will be an easy way for their parents to have some time alone, because every kid loves the beach. Oh the beach. I love the feeling of the sand through my toes. The salty air running over me, the feeling of the water on my feet. I love the ocean. I wanted to be a marine biologist when I was little, but then I found out I would have to be good at math and science. and that is DEFINITELY not me. I do love marine life though. I've been to Corpus Christi a few times in the last couple of years, and both times I have dragged my boyfriend to the Texas State Aquarium so I could go and see the animals. especially the sea otters, they're my favorite. I hear the aquarium in Monteray, CA has a bunch of sea otters. I would love to go there. I have only been to California once, and that was just for one night before I went to Hawaii the next day. What a great state Hawaii is. I don't know why the government doesn't pay for a family to travel there once every couple of years to make the stress go away. They do that in France you know. the government (or your insurance) pays for trips to the beach because of it's natural healing powers. America should do that. If we knew we were promised a trip to Hawaii every year if we didn't committ any crimes, and we payed our taxes. everyone would comply. There would be no more murders, rapes, robberies, or anything of the sort. And if anyone is ever pissed off at the government for anything. well it will all be forgotten after a couple of strawberry daqueries at a swim-up bar in a 5-Star hotel over-looking the Pacific.  They say that having an aquarium releases tension, well just imagine going out on the ocean and seeing dolphins jump next to you on the boat, and whales splashing their tales. That'll do you good for 10 years!  God I need a vacation. Just a little weekend one will do fine. Maybe just to San Antonio, or back down to the coast. hell I'll even settle for home--free meals and shopping in Fort Worth might cure some ailment. But I am pretty sure that the beach is my best bet. The best is late at night on the water. The stars and moon reflect off of the ocean, and everything is still except for the sound of the pulsing waves and the cooling breeze. I think I'll start packing my bag now. Damn, I don't have a swim suit. I'll stop at Target on the way out. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, I don't really know what I am suppose to be doing, so I'll just do the best that I can. I have a lot of thoughts going on in my mind right now. I feel nervous, yet excited to find what college life has yet to bring me. I feel that I need to manage my time more, because I am so scared that everything is going to catch up with me. All weekend I've said that I need to do something, but just can't seem to figure out What I should do. I talk to my mom everyday, and it makes me really sad. Everyday I think of my family and how much I miss them. We are so close and my nieces and nephews mean the world to me, and everytime I talk to them on the phone it makes me cry. I even felt like just leaving, but I know that I have to stay here in order to succeed. My boyfriend doesn't really help out much in making me feel better. He just doesn't understand how it feels to actually miss family. He gets so mad at me just because I call her and he says by me doing that it doesn't make things any better. It's just that she is so sad because I am not there and she's all alone. She thinks that I won't ever come home again, and I know that's not true. I just wish there was a way for me to let her know that. She thinks that just because I left I won't ever see her again. I know that I will never move back home after I graduate, but it will always be home, and I know I will visit her. I also feel so pressured, in soo many ways. I just worry that I won't make it here. I just want it to all end soon. I want to finish school as quickly as possible, because I feel that I need to begin my life. I mean not begin my life, but actually start my own. I need to get out and see the real world on my own perspective. My mom has held this shield over me my whole life, so being here has opened my eyes a whole lot. I've learned so much, but know that I have so much more to see. I really wish I could experience more things though. I mean having a boyfriend holds me back a lot. I haven't gotten to experience all the things that I should.   Sorry I don't know if this is going to work, but I realized I didn't put in my social or name. 462898153- Virginia Moreno "
Tell me about yourself.,"I don't know what I'm doing tonight. There's a Cory Morrow concert at the Midnight Rodeo place on Ben White. I have no idea how I would get there. Maybe I could get my ex-girlfriend to take me, but that'd be pretty weird. I was just looking online and saw that some OU/UT tickets are going for like $2000. I don't know what people were thinking when they didn't get reserved season football tickets. I just had to go up to the line once and got all my tickets for the entire season, including the OU/UT game. Pretty cool. Ya, Mike's getting upset at me cause I'm not going to College Station this weekend. Instead, I'm going to go see Jerry Jeff Walker in Gruene on Saturday. God, I hate this Nashville country thing. I got to change the radio station. It's upsetting. I wonder where my roomate Houston is. He was supposed to be back around 4:30 and he still hasn't showed up. Oh well. I got all of my calculus homework except for like 2 problems done, so that's pretty cool. I wish he would clean his side of the room a little more. I want to go play soccer tonight at Clark Field, but they're like watching American Pie 2 tonight. That's really cool. Oh well. Haha, it's only been four minutes? This is going to take forever. I can't wait to go back to St. Joe for homecoming. I want to go to the alumni party before the game. Supposedly, it's pretty fun. They don't really mind at all if you're underage. Haha. My leg is hurting because I'm pressing it up against the table while i write. What other homework do I have to do tonight? Hm. . . Oh, I have to print out some Spanish worksheets. My computer keeps humming at odd intervals. I wonder what's going on there. I can't find a decent radio station that I can recieve in my dorm. I'm going to put some music from Kazaa on. Haha, just kidding. Travis Tritt- It's a Great Day to be Alive just came on. Haha. I hope ya'll don't really care about grammar and all that because I'm just trying to write quickly without caring about that kind of stuff. This song reminds me of Garner State Park. That was a blast. They have these dances every night and most people at the park go there. It's awesome. My buddies and I met all these cute girls from Baytown, or something like that. All I know is that I want to go to Baytown sometime! haha. My bed isn't too comfy. It could be a lot nicer. I need to fix that somehow. Great, this song is ending. I wonder what's next. Haha, a little Kazaa is next. You ever listened to   Me and Billy the Kid   by Pat Green? Let me tell ya, it's a good song. I wish I could play the fiddle that well. I need to sign up for a music course next semester on how to play the fiddle . That'd be cool. I suck at it now, but being good at it wouldn't be bad. haha. Only halfway done. I wonder how much people write in these things. I bet reading them is pretty darn interesting. Haha i held back with the   darn   right there. haha. Anyways, I don't want to do calculus. The fiddle sounds really cool in this song. Here's the solo. IT soudns awesome. Seriously, download the song and listen to the solo. You'll like it. . . if you're a Texan. . haha. I hate Antonian high school. My buddy sent me a link to a webpage of theirs, and they were all proud of having made it to the state semis in baseball. Funny thing is, they lost in the first round of playoffs. We had the same records last year (need to change song again) but they went to playoffs because they had a better head to head record. We lost to them both times in the bottom of the last inning. You have no idea how upset we were. A freaking junior dropped a fly ball in the outfield to give them the tying run. I'm still pissed about that, but oh well. This song is awesome. Southbound 35 by Pat Green. It talks about coming back to Texas when he's leaving in Kansas. It's pretty cool. So what else. . I don't know how I'm getting to the OU game. I got to find a ride, maybe with Amy. Homework is no fun. Haha. I love it when they mention Austin in songs. It's pretty cool. I have to clean my room. I need to call whats that place. Midnight Rodeo and ask about the cover and when Cory goes on stage. Hope it's not much. College is quite expensive man. I love this part. Ya. . we were. soutbound 35!. . haha. New song coming. . I feel like a little Palo Alto, Naked Sorority Girls. The lyrics in that one are pretty funny. A Sigma Chi guy showed me this song during Rush Week. They're too expenisve. I think Delta Sig is the way to go. They're cool. This song has an awesome beat. Haha almost done. This actually went by pretty fast. What to do after? Maybe find someone who knows how to do those calculus problems. But when it comes to love, its all Greek to me! haha. . . I love this song. Well this has been fun. Adios till next time. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now I'm feeling a little stressed out and worn thin. I'm a real estate agent and a full time student as well. I've been to Round Rock this morning again for the second day in a row for a 9:30 appointment. I just can't seem to get everything done that needs to be done. I've got a ton of laundry to wash, my cell phone is ringing AGAIN, and tons of reading and studying to still do this week. I'm a little down because I had two deals at work fall through yesterday. I had to deal with another agent that was the most ignorant and unprofessional one I've had to deal with yet. His clients backed out of a deal on my listing and as a result I'm not closing on my client's new home. It's not a good time to be a real estate agent in Austin right now, but I'm trying my best and I guess that's all I can do. I'm not a traditional student and I feel a little out of the crowd in my classes. I've been working full time since I graduated over six years ago and going to school at night. I finally got to a point where I couldn't take any more night classes and here I am trying to finish up during the day. I've learned a lot and I value my experiences over the years. Sometimes I can't see the light at the end of the tunnel. It seems crazy I'm doing all this at once sometime, but bills have to be paid, I have to eat, and the cycle goes on. I do work hard, but I've almost forgotten how to relax and take it easy. I don't have time to watch TV and do a lot of things I really enjoy. I guess I'm more frustrated at the fact that there aren't more hours in the day than I am at myself for not accomplishing more. This is an odd assignment to do. I've never heard of something like this before. I am enjoying my classes even if I do feel like the outsider in most of them. I like to learn new things and have challenges I know I can get through and do well with. There are some nice people I've met at school, but most people I've noticed don't talk a lot and don't make eye contact when you pass by them. I haven't figured out why this is yet, but I'm curious. I'm friendly and smile and talk to people. It's strange they don't always respond. I was just brought up differently I guess. I'm not feeling really great right now. It's probably from stress, but I'm hoping it's just something in the air that will go away soon. I can't afford to be sick. It just won't work right now. My nose is all stuffed up and my throught is itchy, so I've been popping vitamin C's like they're going out of style. Let's see. . what else am I feeling? Well, I'm in love and very happy with my relationship. I came here to Austin a year ago because of him. We have a good relationship and get along great most of the time. Moving in together and moving to a new city was a challenge though. I was the most pathetic, depressed little thing when I first came here but I've moved out of that phase and am much happier now. I don't deal well with extreme changes. I set schedules for myself, but I don't always stick to them because I try to fit too much in. I've been late to everything it seems lately and I need to work on that. I don't like being late because it's rude and embarrassing. I don't have a lot of friends, but the few I have are very good friends. My sister just moved here this summer and I feel like a part of me that was missing before is back again. We grew up a year apart and were like twins growing up. We can do that thing where you talk without saying a word a lot of times. It kind of freaks people out, but it's fun. My cell phone is ringing again. I'm thinking about all the work stuff that I need to get done today. I haven't had time to get to my office yet and I've got at least six people to call back here when I'm done. I'm going to have a lot of weight lifted from my shoulders as soon as my deal closes on the 24th. I need the money for sure. That's my other stress, but it's getting better. Overall, I think I worry about things too much. I've always had enough to get by through good times and bad. Somehow I always make it through. I guess I'm stronger than I look. I'll be back to work in a minute. Maybe I can learn to balance my schedule better over the next few weeks. It'll be easier someday I'm sure. This has been interesting. I feel like I've been rambling for 20 minutes. Well, I'm back to work again.          "
Tell me about yourself.,"     Write now I'm very tired I just got home from Austin. I haven't been getting much sleep lately so I have really been dragging. I'm fixing to eat dinner with my family. I have alot of homework to do tonight including some calculus which is very frustrating. My house is very quiet the only sound in it seems to be me striking on these keys. This is an unusal assignment I have never done anything like this in the past. So far I am enjoying school at Ut it is my first semester and although it is all a little overwhelming I think things are going to work out. I have to comute back and forth everyday that is the only thing that seems to be gettiong old. I went to the UT football game on Saturday I had a great time but, wished that we would have played better in the second half. I love sports I have played them since I was five. I fact this is probaly the first time in my life where I havn't been playing sports. Now the noise in my house starts to raise a little as my brother gets home from tennis practice. He is a good kid I'm glad that he is doing so good in school right now. He tries really hard, and takes things really seriously. I smell my mom making diner. She works in Austin as well and has to commmute just like I do. My mind is drawing a blank now, I'm so tired it's hard to concentrate. I guess I am a little worried about school, I have to make really good grades this semester because I'm trying to transfer into the business school. I have put alot of pressure on myself to do good in school. I get stressed out when I don't understand some of the material in one of my classes. Calculus worries me the most. I have never been that good at math. I'm struggling right now just going through the review. I try really hard in all my classes but I'm worried that won't be good enoegh. Oh well all I can do is my best. My house has grown quiet again much like it usually is. Now I hear my phone ringing but nobody seems to be answering it. I'm looking forward to a warm bed to sleep in tonight. I have to wake up early to go to work though. I enjoy work at least it breaks up the monotony of being in school all day. Well my time was just up so. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     It seems as though long distance relationships are destined to fail. With the constant talk being seperated and only available for a short period everyday if even everyday I feel a million miles away from my boyfriend, Andrew. September 7th is our 2nd month anniversary and for his birthday he asked for a trip to New York to see the finals of the US Open, which is amazing and quite costly, it just seems that I would want to come see him if given the opportunity to go somewhere. LIfe just seems a bit unfair at times. College has completely thrown me off, my sleep, my eating habits and so on. Not that I don't absolutely love to be here in Austin away from Dallas, I mean im exactly where I want to be, in Austin the greatest city ever, well in Texas for sure, I am thrilled to be out of surburbia ahh, It just like i have wanted to escape from surburbia for such a long time and now that im gone, im lost. I pledged a sorority and am so excited that I will have the opportunity to know so many girls on such a close level but it just seems so hard to get to know them i guess . Its just a struggle that im not sure i will be able to be comfotable with anytime soon. Tonight i went out once again with old high school friends to the gym, its just easier to be close with those who you are already close with. At the gym i ran into EX boyfriend who i just knew i would never see again, he wants to go to dinner, ahhh i just can't see myself going through being near him but not with him. So after talking to him i ran back to my comfort zone, my friends, and we headed out, they told me they were going to a meeting for Texas girls rowing, i was bored and decided to tag along, thinking there is no way i could ever want to be a part of that. but once i was there i just loved it, it motivated me so much, just as much as joining the sorority did, i decided i should stick it out and just go for it. Tomorrow begins the condidtioning for it, i am so excited, its just like soccer tryouts for club soccer when i was in high school. Wow i can't believe that I might possibly be on the rowing team, i have always wanted to be that little girl in the front of the boat, and a girl on the team said I was small enough, well obviously i have never been tall, to be that girl. Oh i forgot the name for that position but nevertheless I am pumped, and slightly nervous that I might not be able to  pump up the other 8 girls on the boat, i think that is how many. Everything seems to cost so much these days too, i wanted to go with my sorority gals to NEw Orleans for the Tulane game but i really don't know that i have $100 to just throw away on a weekend, not like i won't remember it forever, but it just seems so costly since i am spending my own money on it, New orleans would be such a blast though. Endorphines, i think thats how you spell it, are running through my body, I am so excited about conditioning tomorrow and we have a date dash and I am taking a best guy friend, and then two other parties this weekend, i am so excited about this weekend because i missed last weekend. My dad turned 50 wow, that makes me feel so old, i remember him turning 40 i was only 8 but it was such a big party i felt like he was so old then, its just weird that he can register for AARP, i think that is hilarious, and my brother is 21 so soon, in less than a week, im glad i got his card and some money sent off today, that took some stress away, my days just seem so filled these days, boyfriends never understand especially if it is long distance that sometimes i just can't talk, maybe one day ill be single again. not that i want that at all right now, i just hate distance, and i know im not going home soon, i need to get comfortable here and that isnt going to happen by me leaving every weekend. My roommate is the cutest thing ever, she couldn't be any sweeter, but she is going home for the second weekend in a row, i can't wait to take her to a frat party with me, she needs to let go and show her wild side, im really excited about that. Is is bad to want to take friends with me who aren't in my sorority to frat parties, i just like to bring my comfort with me, maybe ill try and go with some sorority sisters some time, i don't really know much about the sorority im curious to find out about it, but i don't want learning about it to seem like a class, i want it to be fun and im really not wanting to take quizzes about it that does not at all sound fun. I wonder why the bums on the drag don't go somewhere else, but imagine all the different types of people they see a day, it just seems so hectic, maybe they need to feel busy and watching others in a hurry makes them feel that. maybe i shouldn't have senior pics of my friends up, i just miss em, and don't really have any new pics, my best friend at A&M , bad choice, is havin fun i think , i really hated it when i went to visit her for her 18th b-day, all the buildings are ugly, and the town is simply dead, i really think i made the right choice "
Tell me about yourself.,"I can't believe that I waited until the very last minute to do this. I've never beem so crazy stressed out of my mind ever in my life. I just couldn't find 20 minutes in the last seven days where I could just sit down when I wasn't totally fried. I hope that this dose not bode poorly for this semester. I think I can oull it out. This Festival I can't believe that Cinematexas is almost here in two weeks my life will be totally different. . Having only had eight days off this entire year is just insane. . I think I'm holding up but I feel that I coming apart now. I think that's what I scared about. This year I've really pushed myself tothe limit in terms of what I can do going jback to school crazy extra curricular stuph I've learned so much. Mostly about what kind of person that I am. What am I capable of. Which is some great stuff. But I'm not there yet I 'm almost there though. It's weird in my film classes when people look to me and vthink that I'm a T. A. or look to me for help. It's strange I guess people see good things in me. I like that annd I do the same thing. . I gues I'm just used to people being more aloof I hope that I'm not that way. some of the people that I have met at this festival have given me that instant companionship. That instant love and that's so great. . I guess when people are looking to me for answers  wheither it's about their cameras of their relationships I guess that means I'm becoming the type of person that I want to be. . That's a great reward in itself. I smoked again two nights ago. I have to stop after quitting for two years I can't fall of the wagon and go back to that. . It was only a few cigs (one fantastic Nat Sherman MCD the very best) I can't let this girl. well she's not doing it really. I can't let the tantrum I'm throwing:) over this girl mess up what took a long time ito acheive I feel like a hypocrite when I smoke now. I don't know I just get lonely filled with self pity overwhelemed and I just want a catharsis. . smoking is sort of one. . I don't know I need ito stop again I don't think I 'll go back to the way it was but it's still scarey. I really think thigs are'nt as bad when I have a second to actually relax and evalute things I feel very good. . like the night before class tabling at the show I realized how many people I have met in the last year how many close friends that I'm making and have made and how important that I've become in certain peoples life and how much I'm going to be doing in the near future. It's all going to be worthwile I think I just feel impaitent it just seems like I've been waiting for ten years to get the chance to do what I want to do. what's going to be the best for me. and every BS class I have to take or everytime some jerk in Communications office is rude to me and everytime I'm treated crappy at work it's just one Bergman-esque humiliation after another. sometimes I hope that my   artistic spirit   doesn't die the death of a million pinpricks. . I really like this kind of writing it's been pretty theraputic, but I have to go    "
Tell me about yourself.," The past week I have honestly felt the most incredible feeling of being overwhelmed. I am so frustrated and annoyed by everyone around me and everything that they do. I so badly want to step forward and correct everything that these people are doing wrong but for some reason I keep holding myself back. This frustration only makes my head hurt and keeps me angry at the world. My presence then becomes quite rude and unfriendly. I'm not quite sure what to do about this little problem. I really don't think that it's me. My suitemate is about to push me over the edge. She never picks up after herself, never helps clean the dorm room, never buys and groceries (even though she finds its all right to consume mass quantities of the food that me and my two other roomates buy), and she basically is worthless around the room. For example, the other day she mentioned that we needed paper towels and bottled water. On most circumstances that wouldnt bother me, however, she makes these claims but at the same time takes no initiative to fix them. She just assumes that me or my roomates will take care of the missing items in the room. She is from Beverly Hills. Im under that impression that she had someone to pick up after her and do everything for her when she lived there. Typical if you ask me. I just can't handle her behavior or her attitude anymore. On top of that, I am homesick. I miss my friends. I miss being with Richie. He'll call me once and a while. Usually he'll call me non stop for a straight week, and then I won't hear from him for quite a while. I get so anxious to hear from him, but he acts like he could care less if he talked to me. That makes me so mad. My roomate aka my best friend since middle school chastises me everytime i talk to him. It just makes me so upset that she thinks that he doesnt care about me in the least. Sure, he may not show the normal feelings that most people show towards the ones that they care about, but I know that he cares about me. If he didnt care, he wouldnt bother calling me. Its honestly one of the worst feelings knowing that your best friend in the world is sitting there making fun of you and getting annoyed by the fact that you are in a complete state of happiness when you talk to the one person you care about. It really makes me wonder why she is the one person I confide in the most. Speaking of her, she is in this relationship with a boy whom I adore as a friend. He is so much fun to be around, but he is here all the time. I turn around and he is always there. I never get to sleep in my own room, I am constantly forgotten about or simply not included in activities that she would normally include me in, and to top it all off, the relationship is not even healthy. I find it ironic that she gets mad at me when I talk to Richie, and feels that she can make whatever assumptions or claims about my relationship with him, but when I make the smallest remark about her and her boyfriend, she flips out. It doesn't seem all that fair to me. But then again, what is fair?  Is it fair that I want to be with someone that I can't have anymore? No its not fair, but thats the way that it will be. Sometimes I wonder if I will ever get a break; If maybe one day I'll get lucky and things will turn out the way I wanted them to, or if maybe Richie will wake up one day and decide that he wants to be with me and not with the girl he is with right now. Sometimes I wonder if my relationship with my mom will ever improve. She and I couldn't possibly be more different than we are. I can't even believe that I am her child sometimes. She acts so much like a child. If she doesn't get her way she mopes and she has to put me down to make herself feel better. She denies having made my sister depressed throughout her late childhood and early adultood. I think that its the subtle remarks about my figure, my study habits, my relationships that make me so mad at her. I want to tell her how I feel but she will retaliate and take something away from me that I need. She always used to do that in high school. If I told her what was on my mind, she would take away my car, or my privileges to stay out late. I can never win. Its either   give up my priviliges   or keep my mouth shut. It is a lose lose situation. I just miss Richie so much. That could be the root of all my unhappiness. My mom, and suitemate could all just be elements of my sadness due to my distance away from him. He called me today. Ironically I was lying in bed thinking about him, when the phone rang. It felt so good to see his name on my cell phone when i looked at it.   "
Tell me about yourself.,"     Well. I just finished my first week of college. I can't believe I'm already here, but I wish I was already out. There seems like so much to do but I'm starting to get things under control. I think. My friend Helen is at A&M and shes going to jump for the track team. She is an emblem of success. everytime I think of her, it reminds me of just how bad of a person I am. I guess everyone makes mistakes, but my mistakes seem to be a lot worse when I make them, because I know better. Hopefully  I can keep up with all my reading assignments. reading is definitely not my thing. especially when I'm forced to do it. Tomorrow's reading time will be flled with the SI class, but that's okay I think I'm going to need as much help as I can get. Tonite's church. thank the Lord. Sometimes you just got to get filled up when everything seems so dry. I love church, but sometimes I feel so . . I don't know. not as good as everyone else. like nobody makes mistakes but me. I know that's not true. only I lie from the devil trying to get me down. anyways today in psychology class someone mentioned obessive cumplusive disorders. and I wanted to scream out. I've been caught in that trap beofre. Which I have and thank the Lord I no longer am bound by that chain. only by the grace of God did I get through some of the worst, tearful, confusing years of my life. Oh. El Patio sounds real good right now. not only because of the delicious food, but because I have to right a paper on it and I need to get some intricate details to make my paper a success! I can't wait to be home tonite. I've been up at school since before 7 am. only to realize that my 8 am class had been canceled. my next class was not until 12 noon. Oh well at least I got some studying in and I was able to finish my english homework so that I wouldn't have any tonite. Praise the Lord. Anyways back tonite. my boyfriend is suppose to call me about ten. man I hope he gets his own phone soon. I miss him. I wish could just get married right now. but my father might have other plans for that situation. . but I don't understand sometimes. why do you always have to wait 'til your outa school before you get married. . of course I understand the logical part of it all, but what about love. although love is suppose to be patient. I don't like preaching to myself all the time. it's like I know what's right but I wish things could be different. I don't know. right now my biggest concern is my dad letting me drive down to San Antonio and pick up Stephen (my boyfriend) on friday afteroon. oh Lord please help me to find favor with him on this situation. Wow. twenty minutes is a lot longer than I thought it was going to be. It's like writing in my journal on the computer. what Dr. Pennebaker said today about when your depressed, to write what your feeling down. I totally agree. I know no matter what I'm feeling it always helps to write in my journal and shed a few tears of course! I like journals soo much that lately, I've been giving them to my friends for their birthdays. my time is clicking down. I really hope I can find a job soon and hopefully my friend Lauren found one today. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     So here I sit in my room just wondering about this asignment and and what it is I'm really thinking, well. I'm thinking of days that seem so far from where I am, the hope of the past I guess you could say. I'm wondering about the possiblitys of the future, I'm thinking about what a friend once asked me not to long ago,   what is your purpose for living?  . I told her I had none. That today I awoke for no other reason than the hope of tommarrow. This was a lie of course, I have purpose, a goal, just one that I am now comming to relize I can't reach. So what do I do?  I think thats what I'm think about most, what now. I'm also injoying a beautiful view outside my window of a world rolling by, sun shining, others walking by, and I wonder what story they have to tell. I need a cigeret. Hold on. God bless nicotine. It is wonderful drug. Many of my friends worry about me dieing because of it, but hey, what am I going to do today about it, nothing. I can fix it tommarrow, maybe thats the root of my bad timming, that always just wait for some other time. I'm considering what I should do about the Z delima, to go friday and just be in a state of medium pain, or to go do something else, something fun. God I hate her friends, and all there insocients and Nieveness, if thats a word. I really don't think I can handle there crap, and I deffinatly can't handle matt trying to be everyones friend, and the center of atention and honestly I don't know what to do. I'd like to go off on him tell him what I think of him and all his crap but I don't think it's my place, well not yet anyway. I need to go buy books. But I probly wait until tommarrow. hehe. Anyway. So there I was in the mists of a great opertunity and I didn't let it pass me by and yet I'm still here. Whats up with that. What is the point of endless philsphy of optimisum if nothing ever comes of it. A whole spewing of quotes just entered my mind, but I really don't feel like typing them. Ok. Now what. I see myself at a quite a problematic state in my life, no where to go, nothing to do,   never felt so alone, never felt so alive.  but then again. But there must be a way, a path, a right choice, but I just don't see it, no clear cut answer, well at least not one to my liking anyhow. A regular Kobi oshi Maro, no win sinerio. Well crap!   What to do. I have very few options at this point, go no go, wait see, leave, forget remember, give, take, sacrifice, avenge. What to do?  Well there is always another option, a path less taken. Away out. I just don't see it, I need to see it, need to free the mind of the wants and needs of myself, seperate, and ingage. What to do?  Ok, best case sinerio I don't do anything, just go with the flow, and most likly I'll get shit. I do something and things are only worse. I leave, and I make everyone pissed. Give and I hurt, take and I hurt others, forget. If I could forget I think I would, but you know, that really never works for me. I can hide, I can wait, but to forget, to let go. never been something I'm good at. I have gotten lots of advise, all of it the same, wait and see. but that just doesn't work for me, though there really is no other alternitive. So I go, I say hello, I leave. Thats what I'll do, and then, I'll go get drunk, always a good idea, yes. Ok so now what. I'm think of writting, but still feel really burnt out after the summer of writting, and all that crap. I really don't have anything to say either. I mean really what is there to say, I'm sad, I'm not at the top of my game. But that will all change, and I think that frustrates me. That there are no absolutes, that given time everything will not be as it is. Some thing will be, but there is always the possiblity for change, the question becomes what do I do to influence change, how do I minpulate the forces that are present in my own life, ussally I'm very good at that, but lately, I guess it's just to complex right now, no conret ansers to what and when and where, and how. But I see them in other peoples lives, maybe I've lost disipline, I let go for to long, and need to take up the  "
Tell me about yourself.,"  There is to much traffic in austin. I am ready to see my girlfriend this weekend. I am glad it is almost the weekend. The buses outside are to loud it is annoying. I guess it is really annoying when someone srives by with loud music in the middle of the night or rotc marches by. I'm thirsty I think I will get so water. I like this deja blue container it works good to refill. On yea that nice and cold. I guess I need to study my spanish when I am done with this. I wonder how my parents are doing, I guess I should call them pretty soon. Five min. and twenty seconds this is going by pretty fast. Tomorrow is friday horray. I am not really sure if that is how horray is spelled. It probaly isn't in the dictionary. There are always car alarms going off if someones car acutually gets robbed no one will know whose it is. That would suck. I like my bob marley poster it is interesting. I guess I should go work out a little today before work. I'll bet work is really boring tonight unless there are a lot of people at the fields. who know. That water tastes good. This psychology is kind of interesting but I still don't know what I am going to major in. It really does bug me I wish I could figure it out. Oh well mabye it will just hit me one day mabye I should just have fun. I need a different soap I don't really like this dail. I wish I wouldn't of bought a big ass bottle of it. It will take forever for me to use it. I wonder whats on tv. It would be kind of hard to watch will I am typing. I want hook up my speakers to my computer, I need to find that damn chord. I need to find someone with a printer for biology homework. What am I going to do when I am done with this I don't know if I really want to study. I guess I have to since I have to work tonight. Wow it is eighty degrees in here. I wonder how acurrate that galelio theremometer is. It seems like it would be pretty acurrate. galelio was a smart guy so why not. looks hot outside im glad I don't have to go out there till later. although it still won't be all that cool.   "
Tell me about yourself.,"     I miss my family. They mean a great deal to me and and love them very much. Without my best friend, Sam, here with me, I wouldn't be here writing this thing. I have never been away from home for more than 10 days and it is something that I know will take some time to get used too. This weekend I will get to see my family and one of my other best friends, Ben, and his family. Sam and I are going to meat them at Lake LBJ Friday afternoon. Wakeboarding, my family and friends, it will be great, I can't wait until Friday. Ut is a lot harder than the junior college I used to go to, its on whole other level and thats why I'm here.  Its time for me to go to the next level and do what I do best, create. I have met a lot of really good people over the last 2 weeks, my friend Sam introduced me to RUF, its a Bible study for college kids, its good me and I like it. Sam also introduced me to Ultimate frisbee, its totally sweet, I'm thinking of playing intermurals, last year the RUF team won the damn thing. I feel more alone right now than I ever have in my life and I think I'm taking it pretty good. I talk to my family everyday and that helps, but when I walk in my door there isn't anybody there who loves me or who asks me how my day was it hurts. Its something that only time can heal. I'm at the age when its time to   leave the nest   so to speak and I've been ready, then questioned myself, then proved my readiness again. My desire to create and express myself grows everyday, as soon as I gain ascess to a darkroom my work will be some of the best I have ever produced to this date. I have never had these intence feallings and I think they will show in my prints. I also have the desire to write a song, my friend Garret, that I met through RUF, and is also one of Sams roomates, writes songs and plays the guitar. I know I can't sing and I know I can't play so writting seems to be a good choice for musical expression. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     Wow, I remember when my english teacher made me do this. It is kind of weird having to do it now. I don't think my teacher really liked english at all. What was the deal with the random acts of kindness journal anyway?  John Mayer is a great musician. I should put his CD on now to break the silence. 20 minutes?  I think I might have to piss sometime in the next 20 minutes. I guess I should have thought of that sooner. I need some   my-size   chicks in my classes. I see them around campus occasionally, but never in my classes. Actually, there may have been some in Psy. , but there were 500+ people. Damn it! I don't need to install any more MS stuff. Quit popping up that update!  I said okay yesterday hoping it would cut me a break, but it is just like the Salvation Army . once you donate stuff, they never give you a break. Hoo Hah!  Time for some Mayer. Man, I love the woofer on my computer!  I have the best,   phattest   bass on my computer stereo. I think my parents miss me. When I call them, it is hard to get off of the phone ever. I hope that I don't get much homework in college. I like SNL, where Tim Meadows did that sketch with the SportsCenter impersonation.   Right about now, the funk soul brother Boo Yah!  Boo Yah!  Boo Yah!  Sweet sassy molassy!    I can't wait until Dave Matthews comes back to Texas. His concert was cool. I need to keep on writing. Orange County was a sweet film. I really like the girlfriend in that movieGoddamn update reminder just froze up my computer!!!! Microsoft is an evil empire!  They don't even give you a way to close the reminder so you just have to leave it there. Crapola!  Don't even ask me when I want to be reminded of the update. Suck it, Trebek!  I bet I seem kind of screwed up if anyone browses this. I love the Mayer song   comfortable,   even though it is a chick song. I wonder if these shoes make me look gay when I wear them with shorts?  Oh well, they are comfortable, so whoa, I just spaced out there for a few minutes. I really should go change the punctuation of the previous sentence. I have always felt like I am missing out on something by never having a girlfriend. Westlake kind of sucked. Maybe it is like getting a car- it is cool for a week or two, and then it loses its glamor. I wonder why no one is sunbathing on Jester beach Damn it! I don't want to update my computer! I did it yesterday!  I miss the good 'ole DOS days. Go to hell, Gates!  Man, for a multi-billionaire, you would think he could get a friggin' descent haircut. It looks nice outside, with the warm sun rays blanketing the gently swaying oak limbs outside my grimy window. I wonder why people say it is a nice day outside, when it is actually better to have cloudy skies to block UV rays and keep me from having to squint. I think the people across the hall are kind of strange. Not Joseph and Demas, but their suitemates. They have all those slutty posters on their wall and whenever I walk by they are playing computer games. Dr. Pepper is the shiznat!  Shiznat . he he he he he!  I am such a friggin' loser! Criminy!  I just lost it again for about 10-15 seconds. I only have two minutes to go now, so I think it is time for a new paragraph.  My fingers are tingling a little bit, which is pretty strange since they should be getting blood from my typing. Oh, well. Maybe I should have kept playing guitar instead of biking. Racing is fun, but you can play guitar anywhere and you don't have to worry about crashing or winning or anything like that. You just can't screw up much while playing in front of an audience. I just copied most of my writing so I can see how much I did. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     This is a bad ass song. i wish Patrick were here so we could drink some beer and hang out. it is too bad he is in a gay ass fraternity. i can't stand his freaking brothers. at least Robbie isn't in a gay fraternity, we chill more than me and Pat ever will. i wish i weren't so fucking sick, i hate the fact that i have to blow my nose every 10 to 15 minutes. and no my freaking printer is going nuts, i hope it isn't broken, it is brand new. it looked like the actual scanner piece is jammed or something. that girl i met today in Economics was pretty cute, i think she was feeling me. i wish i hadn't broke that string on my guitar i miss her badly. i haven't played in almost 2 days. i don't know if i can go another day with out playing it. i am so glad tommorow is Friday, i need a beer. i just wish i didn't feel so bad, all i want to do is sleep. i sure hope this works tonight i didn't work lastnight. i want to be a rock star!  that would the best job ever!  just playing my guitar and singing my songs!  i want to have a good time tommorow night just chill with some friends a drink some beer!  i need a beer, i am defenately going to grab a cold one when this is over. so close. "
Tell me about yourself.," I am feeling very tired at the beginning of this strange assignment. What a long weekend, and day it has been. Rainy days always seem so long and dreary. It has just recently stopped raining but I wish that it hadn't. In my opinion, days spent studying are much better when it is dark and gloomy out than sunny and shiny. I actually love the rain and really enjoy rainy days. I would really prefer for the rainy days to also be cold but that does not happen very much this time of year. One thing that I have been thinking a lot about recently is this new season that is rapidly approaching. I love the fall more tham anytime of year, especially the month of October. What a fabulous month it is. October is long sleeve and jacket weather, football games, State Fair of Texas, and the time when the leaves change. It is always so pleasant and so comforting. I do not know why or when my obsession with October started but it did, and it has been a part of my life for quite some time. This will be my first October away from home though so my expectations could very likely NOT be met. That would be a dissapointment but it would also serve as a reminder to me to not expect anything. I really wish that I would never expect anything from anybody because I am always setting myself up for a dissapointment when I do that. People that do not have really high expectations from others or situations must really benefit from life because everything that happens to them is better than they though it would be. That is actually probably not always true but, its a thought. I tend to have too high expectations from people. I have a big imagination so I will usually get worked up about something before it ever happens, and spend time imaging what it might be like. When I do that, I always find myself dissapointed when things do not turn out the way that they are supposed to. I am about to be distracted from my stream of conciouseness because my roomate and friends keep talking loudly in the hall and I can hear them. It is late at night so I did not take my medicine to help me focus so I hope this does not become too much of a problem. It is very hard for me to concentrate when I can hear one distinct conversation in the background. It is a strange thing, but I could write a paper in the middle of a crowd if it is just useless, background noise, nothing clear, just a lot of muddled voices. If I hear a conversation though, a really clear conversation among a group of people, it becomes near impossible for me to focus. Why is that?  I really do not know. I hate that I am so easily distracted. It is a joke sometimes to even attempt to have a conversation with me about one topic unless I have taken my medicine. I have had ADD for a long time so I do not mind telling people that it does not come natural for me to stay in one, focused conversation for extended periods of time. It is really very sad at times actually because I feel like I am hurting feelings when I do not give a person my full attention, but I don't mean to be. I just have trouble staying on one topic because almost every topic easily flows into a new topic. What a mess I get myself into. I really do amaze myself at times. People probably think that I am very rude but I am not, I just can't stay focused. Right now I am getting a sore in my mouth and it is really bothering me. I think  that it has formed because of the amount of sugar that I have consumed in the last two days. Someone gave me an enormous sack full of candy as a gift and I have consumed about 1/2 of it in the last 48 hours. That is not something that I normally do. I do not feel good about eating candy, or anything unhealthy most of the time. I am actually proud of myself for indulging though. Everybody needs to treat themselves every once in a while. I have a sweet tooth also so I have to satiate it from time to time. I just hope that I never turn into a glutton. How does one become a glutton?  I do not understand how someone could just sit around and get   "
Tell me about yourself.,"     i'm sitting at the pcl library, i can hear the computers humming, i'm typing kind of fast so i'm worried that people will find this annoying, because i sometimes do and sometimes when i click the mouse too fast some people get annoyed. my feet are really hurting from the bruises i think i got from the car accident on wednesday, i'm wondering if i should go to the university health center and talk to someone about it, but i don't know if i'll have time to go up there, and maybe there's nothing to worry about and bruises will fade by themselves anyway. now i'm thinking about the calculus quiz that i did yesterday, i did really bad on it. i ran out of things to say, i'm really sleepy. my uncle left today i feel bad that i didn't say goodbye but he left so early in the morning back to lebanon, i don't know how long it will be until i see him again but he wasn't as friendly as he was a year ago. i remembered last night that it was my 2 friend's birthdays, it was my brother's too and i didn't get him anything. . i really should have, i should go today, but i'm so concerned about how much money i've been spending lately, i don't work anymore and i'm running out of money i should be careful how much i spend, what will i do when i run out, i can't keep asking my dad for money everytime i want to go out for coffee. i just talked to my friend outside she got married last weekend and i was at her wedding and her husband's best friend really liked me and now he asks about me all the time and he wants to drive down from san antonio to see me but i'm so afraid of it, because i was so attracted to him at the wedding, and i thought about him so much after that,and i kept feeling that i wanted to be with him even though i knew i shouldn't have because i have a boyfriend and i must be loyal to him so that i can allow him to trust me because he's insecure sometimes so i don't know what to do. the guy's name is nathan and he's the kind of guy i would love to have as a friend but i don't think he's going to want to settle it at that and i'm afraid that even if he did, i might want more, which would be horribble because of my boyfriend. i'm not sure about my feelings anymore, i'm so afraid that what happened with my last relationship is going to happen all over because i'm so indecisive about my feelings. now i just want to go to sleep. i'm meeting my boyfriend after i finish writing and we're going out to lunch. i'm not that hungry. i know i should watch what i eat like i used to, but i don't anymore. it's becoming bad for me, i'm not even exercising like i used to. i don't know why, i just feel so tired. i got mad at my mom this morning and i feel bad, because it's not really her fault. well maybe it is, i just don't understand why she can't seem to help me out in the morning when she sees that i'm late, why can't she make me a sandwhich so that i can eat on my way out the door, instead of leaving the house with no breakfast and starving because i don't have time to do it myself. it takes her practically no effort, i don't understand. she must think it's a matter of teaching me to do things on my own but i think that's ridiculous, i just need a little help and she wouldn't do it. i'm looking at the time on the screen and i never realized how slow time can be sometimes. this spacebar on the keyboard is really starting to piss me off, what the hell is wrong with it. i'm getting to impatient, i hate it when it sticks. some people are typing really fast, too, i wonder if they're doing the same thing i am. i can't see their screen. a girl is listening to her headphones, it's a good idea. i wonder if we're allowed to burn our own music cd's, i saw a lady doing it at the ugl library and i really want to. but i asked my older brother and he said we're not allowed because those computers are used only for the scanner. supposedly. i'm swaying my chair right now, it calms me down. i want to listen to some music, the nice relaxing kind i listen to on 95. 5, i love that station. they put old music and it's so relaxing. yesterday i was seriously thinking about wearing a scarf. oh. . no that was today, in the shower. it's starting to bother me the way men look at me, as if i'm existing merely for their viewing pleasure, it's disgusting. i've realized lately that i've become very much less concerned with displaying my feelings, for example, if i don't like someone, i can ignore them and i don't care if they notice, or if they know that i don't like them. i never used to do that, i always used to fake it. but now i don't. maybe it's rude, but i'm tired of putting up with things i don't like. i've also noticed that i'm not as open minded as i one was. time is almost up i feel better, but i wonder what i'm going to go do now. i want to lay down somewhere, close my eyes. i feel like cuddling with someone. but my boyfriend won't do it, he'd just want to make out. i don't, i just want someone to hold me. suddenly i feel like crying a little bit. i don't know what's bothering me. a girl sat next to me who looks like jennifer the si instructor. those sessions are helpful. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well this is the first time that I have ever been told to write for twenty minutes straight about what is going on inside of my head. Anyways, yeah it is early in the morning and I just got back from calculus, and I am extremley tired. The reason that I am tired is because I did not get a lot of sleep this weekend. I really wanted to catch up on my sleep but it did not really happen. The reason for this is, that on Saturday night I did not go to bed until like four or five in the morning and then I needed to wake up semi-early to do some necessary homework. I really am a night person and I do not ever mind staying up late even when I have to wake up early the next morning. Well anyways, school has been its usual self. I am really enjoying the college life and the freedom from my parents, but I miss all of my friends so much. I really wish we had more vacation time so that I could spend it with my friends. The person that I miss the most, is of course my sister. We have grown up our whole lives together, and now that she is actually maturing and becoming a normal person, I am not there to see it and it is kind of sad. Anyways, also I miss Kyle a lot. I mean I realized how good of friends we were, but since we have both gone to college, I realize it even more. He is the one that can always put me in a good mood when I am upset. He can always make me feel so much better about myself. I can never get mad at the kid, even if he says the rudest things or the most inconciderate things. He is a great friend and someone that I will always want to be in touch with. I mean saturday night we talked on the phone for like four hours. I mean that is a lot of talking. I never thought I could talk on the phone that much, but with him the conversation is never boring, never worthless, never repetitive. It is always something new and great to hear. Yeah we have our moments where we say somethings to each other that normally if anyone else said that stuff we would get really angry, but we know that we really do not mean it, and that we are really good friends. Well enough about him, he already occupies enough of my time. Twenty minutes is a really long time to type, considering that the first time I did this my computer like froze or something when I pushed the finish button, which really made me mad. Well I also have this other friend named Matt, whom I have known since like sixth grade and have like since sixth grade. He goes to school here and we hang out a lot, but he has a girlfriend in New Jersey, whom I hear about every freakin day of my life. Oh well, nothing I can do about that. I really want to meet some more people. I have been here about two weeks and I have not really met that many people, which is kind of sad.  I am used to having a lot of friends and a lot of friends to do stuff with all the time, and for the first time in my life I do not have a lot of friends and it is kind of depressing. I mean I have no trouble meeting people or even talking to random strangers, but when it comes to really becoming someone friend I am having a harder time than I thought I would. I know that I just need to give it some more time, I can not expect to make everlasting friends within two weeks. I give out that advice to a lot of people, but I do not ever really listen to the advicec myself. Wow, I have like seven minutes left and my left hand is really starting to cramp up and it is getting harder and harder to type as each secong passes. I really wish that this would just end. When you are told to type about what is going on inside your head, you really have trouble. I usually do not have any trouble telling people about things I think about. . Oh my gosh this is so random, but last night around four in the morning or something like that, I woke up with a major cramp in my left calf. It hurt so incredibly bad. I tried walking, but I couldn't. It hurt so bad that I was crying until it went away. Even though it only lasted a short period of time, the time that it did last was torturous. Anyways, back to the analization of how I can not write when someone tells me too. I really wonder how people can take what a person writes and interpret it to mean something totally random. I just find that absolutely bizzare. I do not think that I would ever have that ability. I have two meetingts to go to tonight, and I do not know how I am going to do this, because they are both at the same times. Yay I am getting excited because I only have like two and a half minutes left to go. This really shows you how long twenty minutes is. I always thought that it was a really short time, but when you have to do something like this where you watch the time tick by, you are able to see that twenty minutes is a real long time. I really do not like Mondays and Wednesdays. I do not like the fact that I have classes in the morning and then I have a huge break, and then I have classes in the afternoon. We had open door night last night, and our room won cutest runner up. I do not know who won cutest overall, but we were happy with what we got. It is finally about to come to and end and my hands are in a lot of pain and will be relieved when they do not have to type anymore. Well less than thirty seconds and it is all over. I am way pumped over here.  "
Tell me about yourself.,"   In doing this writing assignment I was unsure of what i would be writing. I am having a pretty good day and I hope that it continues to be good. Transfering to UT this semester has been a great eye opener. This is my first time to live by myself and be away from home. There seems to be so much pressure right now with school and bills. It is hard sometimes to be alone, but I was the one that begged my parents to get me an apartment to myself. I wish sometimes that I would have lived with roommates, so that I would be more familiar with the people and things around me. I like having my own space and freedom, and I'm sure I can adjust the the loneliness. I have been feeling the depression kick in during the last 2 weeks. It is hard, and my phone bill is high, but I know that this is only the beginning of my life. My goal is to get my bachelor's degree in Accounting and then have a great job offer before graduating. Life seems like a blurr sometimes, even when you think you have it all planned out. I don't know what I really want from life besides being happy. I may be greedy, but I want to make a good amount of money, so that I will not have to worry about needs. I have a lot of pressure from my Dad. I have never felt like I can please him in what I do. This is probably why I have such high goals for myself. I've got to come to the realization that I don't need to make my Dad proud of me, but instead make myself proud of me. That is a hard thing to do. I am very critical of myself and if I don't do the very best, sometimes I feel like a failure. Hopefully someday I can feel pleased with myself and my life. I'm not sure what else to write. Well, I miss my friends back home a lot. My two best friends are both far away. I can't really go seem them on the weekends now because of my part-time job. But hopefully we will keep in touch regulary. Psychology is going to be lots of fun this semester. I love the way Mr. Pennebaker teaching. It's make the classroom environment much more relaxed and fun. I hope that I can also learn more about the emotional and physical behaviors that I possess. I often worried that I am crazy, jusk kidding. But there is a point where everyone has their own bit of craziness inside them. There are times that I feel like two different people. It happens very rarely, but I can see at times the difference between how I act and who I really am. It's scary, but I think normal. I sometimes feel like I am putting on a show for others to see and approve of. I have been told that I am a very nice person, but when I see the difference I feel like I am just acting that way. I don't know exactly what I mean, and I may never understand myself. There are numerous questions that I have about life and people. I don't have to know all the answers, but to understand most of them would be meaningful to me. I came from a divorced family, and when I was young I was physically abused. I didn't know the extent of my abuse until my older sister would tell me about it. I must have blocked it all out because I can only recall the moments before and after I was hurt. Which it scares me if I may someday have it all come back to me and it may be too much to handle. When I grew older I was raised in a strict Christian household which has an affect on who I am. I believe in God and Jesus Christ, but there are many questions that I can't answer. But I don't think that life is about knowing all the answers. I just want to understand them. I am just going on about whatever. I kind of feel like I shouldn't have been so personal about my life "
Tell me about yourself.,"  right now I'm thinking about my poor roomates because one of them, Lauren, just found that her little sister woke up this morning to find a bullet hole in her window!  If her bed would've positioned different she would've been dead!  I'm also thinking about my other roomate, Anna, she just found out that she didn't get the job that she wanted because she doesn't have time to go through training. I'm also kind of stressed because one of the reasons I came to this school is to do crew and now I'm nervous I'm not going to make the team, aghh. I also am stressed because I have a lot of homerwork to do right now such as reading for psychology and writing my english paper. It's also hard because I miss my family and wonder why I'm here, but then I think how I wouldn't be happier anywhere else. And then I'm wondering about who's going to be reading this and wondering if they think I'm a psycho and then I wonder, is anyone going to be reading this?  go figure. I'm also really excited to be here be because I hate the snow in Wisconsin (where I'm from) and am so excited not to  be cold here this winter. But I miss all my friends and hope they are happy where they are to. One of my best friends sisters said that in your first two weeks of college you change in ways more than you could ever fathom and you are such a different person the day you walk into your dorm and the day that you walk out. At college you have time to discover who you really are, and that is really cool you, or at least I, can discover who I am without the distractions of my family, my responsibilities, and my friends. In Texas no one knows who I am so I can reinvent myself to be whatever way I like, I can take time to discover if I really like myself and if I don't I have four years to change myself into the person that I want to be, wow I really like that it sounds nice. I just hope that I meet all the people I can and I hope I can get some best friends, I also worry about money and the fact that I'm spending it and not making it. Sometimes I'm so stingy. I also worry about how my family is going to survive without me (I know that sounds selfish) but I do a lot of things such as being a peacemaker  between my sisters and cleaning up after my dog who isn't potty-trained and driving my sisters around and running errands for my parents, I'm sure they'll be fine I just in a way hope that they aren't so that they miss me. I hope that this writing piece doesn't seem self-centered because I'm just writing about myself. I just don't know what else to write about. I'm also listening to Etta James, I love her voice it is so awesome. oww my hands are sore I could never be a secretary.  My major is actually elementary ed with a minor in psychology. I'm really excited to be a teacher but sometimes I wonder how I can be so excited about it or if I'm setting feminism  back because I will be happy in such a traditional role. But hey whatever floats your boat right?  Sometimes I get so excited about the way I'm going to decorate my classroom and the curicullum I'm going to teach. I'm also very excited to take all the classes that are required for my major. They should all be very exciting and hopefully the professors will be enthusiastic because how could they not be they are training us to go into their profession. It's so exciting how college is the step before my real job my whole life I have been preparing for college and now I'm in college and preparing for my next step, my job.   "
Tell me about yourself.,"My name Is Keely and I am a Freshman here at UT. Moving away from home has been a difficult task. I have really been lonely here. I have noticed that it is getting easier though. I do have two brothers that live here in Austin. My oldiest brother also attends UT. He is in his second year of law. My other brother Josh doesn't go to school, but hopefully he will decide to one day. Classes have also been getting more difficult. I have been really stressed out because of all the reading. I am really nervous about some of the upcoming tests. Hopefully I will have prepared myself for them. I have a boyfriend named Jacoby. It was really hard to leave back at home. I miss him very much. This coming weekend is our year anniversary. I really want to go home to see him, but I don't think I'm going to be able to. It is very difficult to be here in Austin without all of my friends. When I'm bored there really isn't anyone to hang out with. My brothers are working a lot so they don't have much time to hang out. My  parents were sad to see me leave for college, my mother expecially. I am the baby of the family. My mother is extremely emotional. She often cries and gets depressed now that all of us are gone. She also calls us a lot more and e-mails me all the time. I feel sorry for her!  The only person she hangs out with is my dad. My dad isn't too bad, he just is set in his ways. He sits in his recliner and watches nascar all the time. My poor mother has to sit there and watch it with him. That really doesn't sound too fun to me. Anyway, I know that I will eventually get used to it here, but it will take some time. I just try to keep myself busy so that I don't have time to think about how homesick I am. At least I have my brothers here. I couldn't imagine being here all alone. I would drive myself crazy!  My roomate is really cool. I got really lucky with that. We have soo much in common. She has the same since of humor as I do. Also, we have all the same classes together, which is really helpful. Now it doesn't seem like I'm alone all the time. I have her there going through the same thing. Another thing is that the bus stop by my dorm takes me straight to my brother's aptartment. This makes it very convinient. I can get off campus and try to get away from it all. Well, I seemed to have come to a block. I can't think of anything to say. I'm trying to keep typing though. Oh, I really am enjoying psy. class. It is really interesting!  I know it is only going to get better too. Psychology is my major (at least for now) so this is my type of thing.           "
Tell me about yourself.,"     My nose is really stuffy right now and I had a fever earlier today but I think it's gone now. I hate not being able to breathe. I can hear the television right now. There's a commercial about honey barbecue wings. I can also hear my room mate typing and clicking her mouse. It's really cold in my room. I'm glad I decided to put my sweater on or I would be extremely cold. I can't really smell anything because of my stuffy nose. My stomach is growling. I have a craving for pizza. Maybe I'll go get some as soon as I finish this assignment. My room mate seems to be frustrated right now. I just heard her sigh. She has a test tomorrow that she needs to study for. She is mad because we weren't able to get football tickets for the OU game in Dallas. I kind of wanted to go and was getting excited about going to it. The television just mentioned something about getting pizza. Now my craving for it is increasing. I can taste it now. It's hard to type for 20 minutes straight. The phone just started ringing and distracted my train of thought for a while. My room mate just left the room to go open the door. I can watch the television from where I am sitting in front of my computer. My room mate's brother just walked in. Now all I can think about is what he is saying and I can't arrange my thoughts now. I just gave my room mate's brother my graphing calculator and showed him how to use it. I can't think of what to type any more. I am quickly running out of ideas. Time is passing really slowly. Typing for 20 minutes is really hard. My room mate is still talking about the OU football tickets. She is getting rid of her wristband and now I am thinking how I need to take mine off too. What other homework do I have?  I don't feel like going to my calculus class tomorrow. It is the most boring class I have because all we do is work out problems. I should go to the discussion session today, but I would rather go shopping with my friend. I keep sniffing. I still wish I could breathe. I think that not being able to breathe is the most annoying thing in the world. I feel as though I want to chop off my nose just so I don't have to feel congested any longer. Is this feeling normal?  Wanting to chop off my nose?  Everytime I get congested I feel the exact same way. Now I am starting to think that there is something wrong with me for wanting to chop off my nose. Oh well, I bet it is a perfectly normal feeling when you are sick and frustrated. I wonder what caused me to become congested. I heard that a lot of people have been sick today. Maybe something is going around. I always get sick. I have the worst immune system. My stomach keeps growling, but I am not sure if I want to eat because I feel as though I shouldn't eat because I want to lose weight although all my friends say that I am crazy for feeling this way. They keep telling me that I am perfectly fine the way I am. I still don't believe them because they don't see what I see in the mirror everyday. I've been told that I have a contorted way of looking at myself and that when I look in the mirror I see something different from what everyone else sees. But isn't that true for a lot of people?  Don't a lot of people see themselves in the mirror and not like what they see?  I think that it is perfectly normal to feel this way. What isn't normal though is acting upon it. Oh well. I can still hear the television and sometimes it distracts my thoughts because I begin to pay more attention to what is on the tv rather than my own thoughts. Now I want goldfish because I just heard the commercial. I can't think of what to type again. I think that this assignment causes us to think too much about what to type and that it puts us on the spot so that we freeze up and are no longer able to type what we think because we keep trying to type interesting things and not simply what is really on our minds. My room mate just laughed. I wonder why she laughed. I can hear the people out in the hallway. These walls are really thin because I can always hear what is going on outside. The refrigerator noise is really annoying. It's so loud. I feel sick still. I just want to go lay in my bed and sleep forever. I never get enough sleep. I always end up staying up really late and then I feel dead in the morning. My foot is falling asleep as well as my hands. I have the worst circulation in the world. Why is it that my feet and hands are constantly falling asleep no matter what position I put them in. I think it has to do with the fact that I don't get the proper nutrients. My hands are starting to get tired now. I can't wait until I am finished typing. I have about 2 minutes left and actually it wasn't really that hard to type for 20 minutes consecutively. I wonder how long everyone else's writing assingments are. I bet some of them will be longer than mine because a lot of people can type faster than I can. Oh well so much for that because it's too late now to start typing faster. I could try but then it would just seem pointless. My contacts are getting dry and it's getting hard to see the screen. I hate sitting at my desk and now my arms are starting to hurt because they are in a weird position. I am almost finished now and almost time to stop. The window just appeared saying that I am finished now and I can stop typing. "
Tell me about yourself.,"This will be an interesting writing assignment, especially fro you readers. Typing out my stream of conciousness thoughts is not exactly something I'm familar with, as you may notice through all my misspellings and everything else you'll notice wrong with my paper. I'm listening ti the Lord of the Rings soundtrack right now, and my room is freezing!!  Brackenridge, even if the rooms are spacious and it's in a convient location, had the most frigid, uncomfterabel environment to live in. Half the time I walk around bundled in every layer of clothes I can find-- I feel liek an Eskimo!!  of course I wouldn't be in my room so much if things at UT were going a little better. Sorry, usually I'm not a whiner, but this past week has been extraordinarily rough. I feel like I don't know anyone, which I don't, and sometimes I 'll go through whole days on just a couple of words spoken to my room mate. A feeling of total isolation isn't exactly the easiest to deal with. I'm usually a pretty social person, actually, i just have trouble meeting the people. However, once I get to know them, I 'll open right up. Yep, I'm an oyster or something--once you get 'em open. My parents haven't called me, which is only a little troubling. I thought most parents wre supposed to hang off onto their child's every footstep as they walked out of the nest to college. My sister has called me a couple of times and actually planned a visit, which I am definitely looking foward to. So, instead of going out with friends or talking to people that care about me, I do my homework. I must be the most ahead inmy studies of any student at UT. Spanish is actually the hardest class for me right now, and probably the least interesting (which might contribute to the hardness factor). Philosophy, Poesis and Psychology are definitely tied for most interesting class of the semester award. I knew I loved English, suspected I'd enjoy the biology and problem-solving of Psychology, but I had no idea I'd find Philosophy even slightly interesting. Right now, I'm reading about the Hindu religion. I love the idea that I'm getting education!!  Psychology and Philosophy fit so well together, too. Usually I study one right after the other because of the overlap in some of the topics that the two classes discuss. While Philosophy ponders the idea of mind in a very abstract, ideal form, Psychology makes more of a direct pursuit to it's functions and how it works. It's amazing to see the two find out the same things or how a discovery in Psychology will back up a wispy thought in Philosophy. Now I'm getting really tired of writing those two class names. I read something interesting the other day that reminded me somewhat of this writing assignment. There was a young girl who was enchanted with this actor that people put her impassioned essay towards the man up on their web site and voted her fan oif the week. At first, her writing started out very structured, in fact, it seemed almost hesitant. However, about half way through her writing, some flood gate in her mind broke and the emotions just splashed messily on the page. She gave up on complete sentences and punctuation and ideas just flowed from her mind in a very sad, sad stream of obsession, desperation and tears. I clicked it away feeling very depressed. She was actually in love with the actor. However, I realized just how powerful this form of writing can be--it allowed me a peek in her mind, into her passions. Reading this, I'd say my passion was homework. That's almost just as distrubing.         "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am sitting at my desk at work. I should be doing other things. I'm angry for having to work today. This should be a day off. I could have taken it off but then I wouldn't get paid. No paid vacation for part time. I am tired even though I got a good amount of sleep last night. I really  shouldn't be tired. I don't feel like going to the gym this afternoon but I wil. I go the gym five days a week and I don't know why. I really don't see any real difference in my body. I started going really to improve myself but I have noticed no change in the several months I've been there. Never the less I still go everyday. I guess I'm just hoping it will pay off. I would really like a nap. Even if i skip the gym and go straight home I can't take a nap. I have homework to do. Not really required home work but reading and prepairing for classes this wek. I am realy trying to stay on top of all my classes this semester. If I slakck off I'll have serious problems in some of my courses. I'm not really sure if this is what I should be writing about. I'm just writing about what I'm thinking about as I sit here tyoing away. The more I think about it these are pretty normal thoughts for me. Most days I am tired and want to skip going to the gym. And most days I still go to the gym. Despite not seeing results I'm not what I would call discouraged. I never think of quiting going to the gym, I just wonder why I see no difference. And everyday I think about all the things I have to do at home that evening. What checks I need to write for bills. I need to write my rent check tonight. I also need to elt my roommates know that the electric and water bill is due soon. I need to change the elevtric and water bil out of my name because I am moving. Thats another thing I have to do when I get home tonight. I havve to start deciding waht I can fir into my new apartment and what I have to store or sell. These are all really basic thoughts for me. I'm always thinking ahead and planning what needs to be done at night or tomorrow or nex week etc. I am very organized, maybe too much if there is such a thing. I dion't really know anyone who is as organized as me. My mother doesn't call me organized she calls me controlling and anal retentive. I prefer organized and in control. I'm not always in control, but she doesn't know that. I don't tell her how out of control I feel in my relationship with my boyfriend. This is also another normal daily thought for me. Why I stay with someone who doesn't feel the same for me as I do for him. Or at least he is not sure. I often wonder if I'm stupid for staying, or is it just him who is tupid because he can't figure out what he wants or what he feels. Maybe its both. Thinkng about how much time I give to my boyfriend and how to limit that time is also a normal daily thought for me, at least lately. I am a planner, I like to know what the plans are for tonight or tomorrow night or the weekend. He doesn't make plans with anyone until that evening arrives. I've gotten to expect that from him but I can't say I've gotten use to it. I wish he would tell me his plans ahead of time but I know that he won't so I'm learining to adapt. I guess it is probaly good for someone like me to be with someone who makes her just relax. I know that everything doesn't have to be planned but for some reason I do try to plan everything I can. Controlling the caos I guess, or to try to control the best I can. I am really out of daily thoughts. I don't know what else to say. writing for twenty minutes straight is hard. My thought are just normal. I am listening to the radio and I don't know this song. Not that it matters I just leave the radio on at work for some background noise. Oh wait, I do know this song. I just didn't recognize it at first. I have a lot of reading to do tonight that I'm not looking forward to. Biology mostly. M developmental calss looks like it will be challenging but possibly very enjoyable. Who am I kidding, by the end of the semester very few classes are enjoyable they are just over and I am always glad just to pass. As orgainsed as I am  I sometimes feel overwhelmed at the beging of the semester trying to get everything organised and figure out what classes to give studying priority to. I usually study first the class I have next. I will fo home and read biology before I read psychology because I have biology tomorrow and psychology is not until wednesday.     "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now i feel as if i need to sleep. Well i at least need to start sleeping on a regular schedule. I have a severe problem with being nocturnal and then not wanting to to anything druing the day ohter than lay around. I think that i am starting to get a little better but i'm not quite sure if i will ever be able to have a good nights sleep. at night. I also and having an interesting time adjusting into school. i have been in school for a year sttraight and I think that i still have   senioritis.   I just don't have the drive to do anything, but i know that i need to get good grades.  I am enjoying my classes this fall much more than the ones that I had this summer. they are actually things that I am interested in and my proffessors are weird or mean like the ones that I had to deal with in the summer semester here. I absolutely love UT, i don't think that there is any way that I could have stayed at home much longer. I'm to the point now that it is really weird whenever i go home and i don't like it very much. I have even started to call austin home. This really bothers some of my friends, mainly the ones who still like back in keller or around keller. I miss my parents a lot and i fell bad that I dislike being at home. I love my mom so much and i worry about her because i know that she is sad. I love my dad too, he and my mom are my favorite people in the whole world and i don't know what i would ever do without them. I feel that i am a disappointment to them though. I am nothing like my sister and i don't have half the book smarts that she does. She got all the intelligence and i got all the common sense, which isnt good when you are going to a school like UT. I love my sister a lot, i just don't know if she likes me that much. We have always had to deal with a lot of sibling rivalry. and you would have thought that it had gotten better but it is just so hard for us to talk sometimes. i think that she is amazing though and i look up to her so much. Right now, I am rally worried about my friend, his dad died not long ago, and i don't know how he is doing. He drinks and smokes all the time and one of his roomates and i are really worried, but it hasnt reached the point where we can say anything to him yet. I think that he would get extremely deffensive especialy if his roomate said something. I really don't know if i can type for another ten minutes, i thought that this time would fly by, but it is actually going really slow. I also don't kow what it is you are expecting from this exercise because i am sure you get a lot of random responses. Anyways, my favorite thing to do in the whole world is Dance. I have been dancing since i was like three and i need to get back into in. Dancing is my utopia and it always makes me feel better. I love everything about it and i know that i need to start taking again before i completely lose the ability. But, it is just so hard to find the time and the money. I need a job if i am going to pay for it and i feel bad asking my mom and dad to pay for it because they are putting so much money into me going to school right now. Aside from my weird sleeping schedule, I also am really weird when it comes to eating. I don't think that I have an eating disorder, but i think that i have something wrong with my stomach that makes me gag, or go through times when i just don't get hungry and the thought of food makes me sick. I think that a lot of my friends worry about me though and think that i am either anorexic or buliemic. I do admit that i am very small, but not discustingly so. I have been living in my apartment for like two weeks now and i have yet to completely unpack my room, this is another example of me being entirely too worthless and having no drive to get up and do something. I know that i will unpack eventually, but i never really see the point. I do love it in my apartment though, my roomates are so cool, and they are really nice to me. I hope that they like me as much as i like them. i am sure that it is kind of weird for them though, like i am invading their territory because, they all knew each other before this and then i moved into the picture. I am going home this weekend for my   boyfriends   birthday. I miss him a lot and i wish that he would transfer to UT. I don't know what is going to happen if we continue fighting like we have been, plus, he just got into a frat, and i don't really like the idea of that too much. I have less than two minutes left and I have absolutely no clue of what to write. I think that after I am done with this I am going to go eat some lasagne. I have a huge craving for it right now for some reason. I think it is because it is five in the afternoon and all i have eaten is fruitloops. Hopefully no one actually reads these assignments because im sure the incessant ramblings of a college student can get kind of redundant and confusing. i know that i would not want that job.  "
Tell me about yourself.,"Wow I'm probably not doing this under the smartest of conditions seeing that I'm listening to some Allman Bros. very loud as well as the St. Louis / Denver game in the background but what the hell why not. I was thinking about what the hell I was going to write about earlier and I guess it should be what it is -- a stream of consciousness. Ha. Well anyway I probably should not stop writing. It's funny how sometimes your mind works faster than the rest of your body (especially your hands) because sometimes I will think of something and begin typing it and then I will forget what in the hell I was thinking about until it's too late. The same thing even happens in conversations, and that sucks a big fat hairy one when I'm in the middle of talking with some one about school or music or the thing I was watching last night and then I will completely go blank because it takes me so long to get the words out of my mouth. Hmm it's very tempting to get lost in watching that clock in the upper portion of the screen. I keep seeing it tick away the seconds and it makes me want to look at it. I find all of this internet stuff veryu fascinating, especially since I am fairly proficient in it. Wow, this feels almost like an inner monologue because deep down in the back of my consciousness I know that I will be the only one reading it, so I get almost this pointless feeling to myself as to why in the world I am even putting forth any effort into doing such an assignment. Hmm that was the third time I have corrected my spelling. I wonder how many other people are as anal retentive as myself and are constantly correcting their spelling in this assignment. Typing is such a weird thing. I do it so much that I feel fairly proficient, but I was talking to pops last night and he said that he only types with two fingers. How does one get through life in any situation where he/she only types with two fingers. I just thought about what an ass I was last night. I was supposed to go to see Keller Williams with a fairly attractive, but fairly annoying and fairly commonly high girl a few floors up, but I felt really sick yesterday and the rain made me extremely lazy, so I told her in no uncertain terms that we probably wouldn't go to the concert even though that's all we had talked about the week before. I'm such a jackass / loser when it comes to relations with the ladies. I don't know what in the hell that last thing was, but oh well. Wow I wonder what a handful of other people I know here and at LSU are doing at this exact second?  Hmm eight minutes and thirty seconds. The death knell tolls in the background. As does   Every Hungry Woman   off of the Allman Bros. ' first and self titles release. Wow, I will type anything to keep the flow going. The only other time I can think of stream of consciousness in my real world experience is a brief relation in   The Sixth Sense   when that little Haley Joel kid writes down every and any bad word imaginable and that terribly boring and lifeless novel I had to read in 8th grade called The Reivers. I can't think of the author right now, just because if I sat and thought I'd stop typing and that would defeat the whole purpose of this excercise. Hmm President Bush is on TV right now. How sad it is that people criticize him constantly. What a load of hypocritical, cynical assholes. Wow, now I really feel like that little shit in the Sixth Sense as I constantly am using bad language. What a sad world I live in vocabularily (if that is even a word) if all I can do is cuss in a paper. I guess that's not all that I'm doing, but it is a lot of what I'm doing. Wow, that was a complete waste of a sentence. As was that one. And that one. Wow I could go on for hours like this. I don't think I have misspelled very many words so far. Wow, I deserve a cookie. What a sad statement. This paper is riddled with psychological buzz words and phrases. What a head-case am I. Ok, Yoda, enough. Speaking of Yoda, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back was one funny, yet dissapointing movie. I don't know why I chose that one out of Kevin Smith's entire repituare (that is most definately not spelled correctly), seeing as Mallrats, Chasing Amy, and Clerks were fairly brilliant, and Dogma was exceptionally interesting although quite blasphemous, but I guess that's why I was so let down by J&SB Strike Back. It's funny how your mind jumps from one idea to another. I was just thinking about when I could go back home and see the folks. For some reason, I only get homesick and depressed when I am severly screwed up, which is possible, I guess, because I can see more clearly, I don't know. And by screwed up I don't mean on heroin or crack which some may need to believe. I'd never do that hard shit (I think the bad language is necessary there, eh?) Eh, what the hell am I, Canadian. Wait, no, canadian. I don't think they deserve a capital C. Well, they get a lot of flack for no reason. So I guess I can say Canadian. There, was that so hard. Yes. More inner monologue. Uggggh. 1. 5 minutes left. This is an exceptionally long feeling. I just got finished (before I started into this thing) reformatting and reinstalling Windows XP on my suitemate's laptop. I enjoy doing crap like that. Ever since I've been here it seems like there aren't very many computer proficient people like back in Louisiana. Oh well. Time's almmost up. Yep, time she is a up. We'll delve into this more deeply next week (By the way, that was Something About Mary. ). "
Tell me about yourself.,"Just like everyone else's writings, I'm sure starting off with I don't know what to write is commonplace. we used to have to write like this in english last year but Mrs. williams would give us a specific topic- like ""king kong"" or ""umbrellas"". she was the coolest teacher, she really had a good time teaching our class and made sure we had a good time too. a lot of the guys took advantage of her good nature though, especially when we had to do the ""hobbitt"" project and austin named one of the characters ""dildo daggins"". that was interesting because Mrs. williams couldn't really hear them say ""dildo"" and wondered why the class was laughing so hard. I wasn't in that class but I got to hear all about it. I really miss all those guys, we had a pretty close group of friends because we all grew up together and went to pretty much all the same schools together. by graduation there were about 7 of us that had gone through school together since pre-k. I think that says a lot about us. there are others that I've gone to school with since elementary school too since we were all in the same advanced classes. this annoying ""firewall alert"" keeps popping up on my screen and it's bugging the fire out of me cause I don't like computers to begin with and I can't get it to stop. kinda like our smoke detector. it beeped for 4 days before someone would come to change it. my roommate went out of town this weekend and when she got back and came in the room she said ""is that thing STILL beeping?"" and she told me it had been beeping for 2 days and she kept forgetting to report it. so I went downstairs to report it and they told me no one would come until at least Monday because the maintenance crew doesn't work on the weekends. it really sucks cause I couldn't study or sleep in here because the thing beeped every 45 seconds. I ended up staying at towers with my guy friends from high school and we had a really good time- so I guess it worked out. I think I'm going to start dating their third roommate- he is from san antonio and I've really gotten to know him the past couple of weeks cause I'm always at my guy friends' place. oh yah- and the maintenance guy finally came today and fixed the smoke detector. I don't know where my roommate is, she left at 5:30 for her sorority meeting and I left for mine at 6 but she is still not back and it's almost 9. my dad called today and wants me to go to my grandparents sometime soon and shut off the hot water heater. my grandparents have been traveling in colorado since the beginning of july and when my parents came to move me in they stayed out at my grandparents (in south austin) and forgot to turn off the hot water heater. I don't understand why he wants me to do it- he could call their neighbors, which would be a lot more convenient (sp?) for me since I don't have a car. I called two of my friends to see if I could borrow their car but neither one of them picked up the phone, so maybe my roommate will take me out there later. I wish I could drive her car but it's a standard and I'm not very good at them. I got my nose re-pierced last night, chasity (my roommate) went with me. I got it done when I was in Ecuador this summer for a dollar and here they wanted $30! I wanted to scream. but oh well- it'll be there for a while. I took it out when I got home from ecuador because I didn't know how my parents would feel about it, and I know my dad's parents would shit bricks if they saw it, so I decided to play it cool and take it out when I was around my parents or grandparents, but it became too much of a hassle and I left it out too long. I really like it though- the stud it a tiny light blue rhinestone. I have a white one I got while I was in ecuador that I'm going to change out pretty soon. my roommate has her nose pierced too. I can't wait to show my brother. I called him last night to tell him and he was kinda mad that I did it without him because I had told him that I'd get it done before I left for college and that he could go with me but it just never happened. it's a big thing in Chile from girls to have their nose pierced and while we were in Ecuador a youth group of about 20 came up from Chile. I really miss Ecuador- I can't wait to go back, even though I don't speak the language very well I made a lot of great relationships. this one guy, dandle, from Chile, really had an impact on me. we still talk through e-mail daily and it's awesome to see things from his perspective. he is the person I'd most like to see again. he taught himself to speak English- he is never had a formal English lesson, and he wants to be a youth minister or music minister. I'm so impressed by his faith and his determination to educate himself. I really wish I had that mindset and determination to better myself without the help of teachers and tutors and school- but there are so many opportunities here that make it easier to get help I suppose. the time's almost up- I really didn't think I'd be able to type and think for 20 minutes but it's kinda flown by in a hurry- bye! "
Tell me about yourself.,"So I'm laughing right now because I think this is really weird. Makes me feel kind of uncomfortable I guess, I don't know why though. But my stomach kind of hurts right now, my roommate and I just had some ice cream, so maybe that's why. I'm kind of stressed right now, and I hope I get everything I need to get done done tonight. I'm really tired and I just want to go to bed. I'm really hot in my dorm, maybe I should turn the fan on, but I'm too lazy to get up and do that right now. So I'm wondering what my boyfriend is doing right now. I talked to him a few minutes ago and he was doing homework. I wonder what homework he has?  Man, I'm really not looking forward to tomorrow. I have so much stuff to do, at least that's what I feel like. And I really want to go to TOPS to look at the pictures. Hopefully Claire will go with me tomorrow and do that. My foot is really itching me, I think I got bit by a bug tonight at the ZETA house. I was outside doing my homework which was probably not a good idea, but oh well. Oh I need to call my parents too. I wonder if they're having a good time in Canada. I wish I was there right now. I miss them already, but I'm only three hours away so it's okay. I'll be fine. I really want to go running outside on the track tonight. It felt so good out earlier and I bet that would help with my feeling stressed out. But I probably won't because I'm so tired and my stomach still hurts. I wonder what's wrong with it. Twenty minutes is a long time, I've only been writing for seven minutes now, wow. I hope I have fun this weekend. I'm excited about the UT football game. The last game was so much fun even though it was raining. I guess that made it more interesting. I'm looking at my pictures by my desk now and I really miss my friends from my hometown. I really miss Angie, I hope she is doing fine at Kingwood College. And Justin, I hope he is still not mad at me. Maybe I should call him tomorrow, I think I will. And I can't believe Kristin got her nose pierced up in Colorado. She is a wild one, but I guess that makes her who she is. I wish I was in Colorado. I love the mountains and the nice weather there. I bet she is having a great time at school. I'm spacing out right now. I never thought I could have writer's block when I'm writing about what's going through my head. That's really weird. And I'm saying really"" a lot. I guess I like that word or something, who knows. I need to go to the bathroom, but I only have about seven more minutes, so I'm just going to wait it out. Is going to even a word?  I'm not sure. I'm thinking about tomorrow again and hoping that my TA for Calculus teaches well tomorrow. I can't really understand him and I really need help in that class, so hopefully he will have some good things to say. Our sink in the room keeps on dripping and it's really bothering me. I wish it would stop. Claire just got a phone call, I wonder who it is?  She is a cool girl, I'm glad I'm rooming with her. If I had to room with a complete weirdo I would freak out. That would be horrible. I think she is talking to her somewhat ""boyfriend. ""  They're dating I guess, and I set them up!  I did a good job. I guess he is coming up to our room right now. Claire's excited!  I wish my boyfriend was coming to see me. He lives in Riverside so I understand. I hope Justin doesn't think I'm a complete slob when he comes up here since I'm in my pajamas and have no make up on. Oh well, I don't need to impress him anyways. It just got really quiet in our room. It's an awkward silence because Claire just turned her fan off. She must be cold, but why and I so hot. I just popped my back and it felt so good. It's been pretty sore lately, but I'm not sure why. I just remembered that I have to read after this. That really sucks. It's going to be a long night I guess, but I can handle it. Oh Justin is here now, that's cool. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well today I can't believe I got on the wrong bus. I felt like such a nerd, but oh well I guess everyone has to learn somehow and every one makes mistakes. I can't believe how nice it felt outside today as compared to how hot outside it was yesterday. I am so hungry, I really wish they would have broccoli cheese soup for dinner but I know they won't. I guess I will just have a salad again. Even though I eat salad almost everyday I still cannot lose the 5 pounds I gained over the summer. Its not like anyone can tell but in the back of my mind I just know that I look so much bigger than I used to. When doing the pretesting earlier this week I couldn't believe all the questions they asked about eating. I can't believe that people actually can do that to their bodies. I am thankful that I do not have to worry about my body in that sense. I wonder what my boyfriend is doing right now. He lives in Vegas and it is so hard being away from him. I can't believe I have loved him for 5 months. I am so scared that he will stop loving me and all of a sudden realize that he can do so much better and leave me. If I had to see him at tournaments and he had a new girlfriend I don't know what I would do. He means so much to me but no matter how many times he tells me that he loves me and that he misses me I never believe him. He gets mad that I don't trust him but he should blame that on my ex-boyfriend not me. Oh well I guess if it is meant to be than it will be. I am listening to the saddest song called Butterfly Kisses, about a father and daughter. I have missed my dad and dogs the most since I have been gone. My dad is one of my best friends and he always knows exactly what to do. He is the only reason I want to do well in school, just to make him proud is the best feeling in the world. I wish I could tell my dad that I loved him but for some reason we never express those feelings. I know he loves me a lot because he pays for me to go to school and to fly all over the country to do taekwondo, but I wish it would be ok if I could hug him. Instead we always bow and shake hands, that's how you do in in taekwondo. He would do anything to make me happy and he even spent 100 dollars to change my flight so at fall nationals I could spend an extra day with my boyfriend. On the other hand, my mom and I do not get along so well all the time. I love her and when I was sick last weekend she came up and brought me soup and took me shopping, but I don't respect her because she can be very rude to people and when she gets mad she can be mentally abusive. It was horrible living with her when I was 13-17, by the time I was 18 I started fighting back and leaving whenever she would yell at me. My biggest fear besides dying is turning into her and yelling at my kids like she yelled at me. I don't know why my dad still loves her and how he can put up with it, it is not normal how she talks to him or me sometimes. She doesn't understand why I don't want her around my friends or my boyfriend but its because I don't want her to turn into that other person and yell at me in front of them because it really is frightening. My friend Matt just came over to distract me and prevent me from getting an A on this assignment which seems to have no real purpose, but maybe it will after I finish and turn this in. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm sitting here typing on the computer and the clock is a little bit distracting, but I think I can handle it. I just connected my printer to the computer with a cable I didn't know I had. there are sirens going off outside I hope this is a safe area to live and hey my dad just walked in the door I wonder if I'm a fast enough typist I really like the picture I have in my room its of some toucans and its got a lot of color in it because I like color my couch in the living room is red and my dog won't stop barking outside. I think I'm going to go get her after I finish this assignment. I just took the long quiz so I'm tired of staring at this computer screen  I still have to go find what to wear tomorrow and get a parking permit my phone is ringing hmmm should I answer it or keep typing I guess I'm going to keep typing because it stopped I hope it wasn't very important or someone doesn't think I am intentionally ignoring them my dad should be coming back soon I think he is across the street talking to the neighbors who seem to be very nice I need him to help me hang up some mirrors and finish my fence sometime this week so he can leave that doesn't sound very nice I just noticed the air conditioning is making a really weird sound my dad just walked in with my puppy her name is trinket if he claims not to like dogs I really can't tell by the way he babies her its kind of funny oh you know what happened to me today was I solved a mystery and it was kind of funny the way it happened I was online and I tried iming my best friend and she wouldn't answer back so I was thinking ok maybe she is mad at me so I called her and she said she wasn't online so I thought ok who is trying to steal her identity she wanted me to try and find out who it was so I started asking the person numerous questions awww my little puppy just came and is trying to type on the keyboard I think she just wants attention   ok its really hard to type right now she keeps trying to lick my hand ok my dad is calling her to go outside and she won't listen I think she has selective hearing the air conditioner just came on again with that weird noise ouch that really hurt trinket just scratched my arm with her sharp nails I need to take her to petsmart to get her a new collar oh as I was saying about the mystery person online who was posing as my best friend, yeah I kept bugging them until they finally answered back saying please don't try to contact this address again (I think they were getting fed up with all the questions) but I kept asking who is this and it turned out to be her grandma in arkansas!  it was so funny cause I was like don't you have your own sn and then it was like Oh hey I know you! and she started talking to me about how I was liking UT and all and people keep signing on my buddy list and I really hope this clock stops soon because my phone is ringing again but I don't think I should stop to answer it I guess I'll call back later its only 8:56 so its not too late I just really don't want to get up in the morning oh I just got this really bad cramp in my side and its hurting really bad I wonder if appendicitis is on your left or right side cause if its on the right  oh its stopped maybe it was the way I was laying on the floor its kind of uncomfortable but until I can get my desk and everything set up for my computer I guess I have to keep typing down here on the floor I'm kind of tired right now I still need to go check on my parking pass. I hope these aren't supposed to be written in complete sentences but I don't think they are because its a stream of consciousness paper and it seems like I keep worrying about too much so I'm not going to worry about it anyways the time is almost up I wonder what matt is doing right now I was talking to him last night and all the sudden the phone just cut off because I think it was his phone that ran out of batteries so it just died right there in the middle of the conversation which I really hate that I had to finish my thought this thing is addicting "
Tell me about yourself.,"Lunch was good. Not sure if I'm still hungry or not. My room is slowly warming up. It was 55 degrees when I woke up this morning. It now reads 63. 1. I can still taste the peanut butter and jelly in my mouth. I think I'm full. My grandparents are coming today. they get in around 11 pm. I am really excited to see them. Although, that does entail me going home a lot to see them. I don't know what to study tonight at the house. I think I'm going to outline some biology, finish my prelab, maybe read some more psychology for next week. Here's my work out plan for this week. Monday--way to tired to do anything, Tuesday--extreme hip hop at atomic. wed-going to booty rama, hopefully. Thursday, I think ill be too tired and sore to do much of anything. Run on Friday, and maybe Saturday. My suitemate is leaving for class now. someone just signed off from my buddy list. I went to tops before lunch, got 5 pictures. ok they charge 2. 75 per picture! that's unbelievable, but they make a whole lot of money. I'm looking at a picture of dewan, it makes me laugh a lot, oh I need to call dr. dewan to see if I can go visit him this week. I also need to call Mrs. Allen to tell her a good time for me to tutor Jamison. I need to remember to ask today during the meeting how long the owl pal on Thursday will take. Someone's phone is ringing. It is so much warmer in my room now. I can't believe that my grandparents are coming tonight. her message is about her computer. ok. what now. I really want to talk to billy or dewan just to see how they are. maybe ill call later on this week. WE have an SAE mixer on Wednesday. I hope I get a date for Friday, otherwise that means that I probably won't go. I need to brush my teeth. What should I wear to the meeting tonight?  I wish who ever is using the washer would hurry up and take their clothes and put in in the dryer so that people like me can wash their clothes. I have a shortage. especially of bras. the tower is ringing cause is quarter till the hour. my vase with bamboo is fogging up due to the temperature change. Oko I think I'm full. I hope biology is interesting today. And psychology. oh that's that one I'm most concerned about. I need to download more songs. wow I'm only halfway through. its 65. 7 now. so much warmer. Ohh I should probably start studying for my test on Thursday in my intro to greek and latin elements in English. So I can't believe that there is a girl in my pledge class with fake boobs. that's crazy. oh I really need some wall decor. Maybe some pictures or a bulletin board, something though cause its really plain right now. I'm looking at a picture of my family from graduation. we look cute. I started to watch notting hill last night, it was good. ohh I went to bed at 9:30. It felt so good, but definitely still not enough sleep. someone just signed on, but lauren signed off. I hope meghan is doing ok. her health just isn't going for her right now. Lord, please watch over meghan and her health and her mom. May the doctors find out what is wrong with her. Brooke just got home. She is listening to her message, her computer is dead. I'm nervous for my first biology test. I'm excited for this weekend, paige is coming on town, there's a football game, and I think fiji foam is on Saturday. alright were almost there's about 6 minutes left to go. So I cannot believe that this sara chick knows peco and has made out with him. I need some ribbon to hang my roses. pledge meeting is tonight, still don't know what I'm wearing. probably ill end up in a skirt and a white shirt. maybe some capris, well see. I'm so scared of the freshman 15. I don't want to gain weight, but they say that you drop it once summer comes around, I don't know if that will happen for me considering I live here. oh man I miss everyone so much. I really want everyone to come back so that we can hang out again. Its a long ways from thanksgiving. I need to get some pictures developed. oh so I have absolutely no idea of what I'm going to do next year for rooming. I don't know if I should room with mary grace, or catie and jen?  ahh this is frustrating. I have put it in Gods hands and now I just have to wait and be patient, although it is quite difficult. ok there were some bells ringing incessantly, but they have stopped. It is so much warmer its great. and here the bells go again. and I'm done thinking. I have the nasty aftertaste of onions in my mouth. need to brush my teeth. Katie just wrote herself a message that reads, katie. call UPS stupid, love me. haha that's great. Brookes leaving to go to class. I guess ill see her in psychology and maybe well sit next to cute boys. I really really really want to do my laundry. ok what's with the bells honestly    maybe its a wind chime outside. yes forty seconds to go. this has been the most random mixture of thoughts possible. ohh I want to see abby soon and talk to her and let her meet my parents. I really have to pee so I'm going to take care of that as soon as this is over and we are done! "
Tell me about yourself.,"so what do I think about for twenty minutes. I don't really know. it's different when you actually have to think about what you're thinking about. my feet are cold. which is so weird because my room is always hot! We really need to get that fan that we talked about. I wish I was home; I was always the right temperature at home. and if I wasn't I could just change it. oh well I'll be home at the end of this week. I hope steffie is feeling better and not having too hard of a time with classes. I haven't talked to nick since I've been gone; I wonder if he even misses me. probably not so much since he just started middle school and he is making all new friends. how come I haven't made all new friends? maybe I should have gone to a smaller college. I dunno, I just wish I wasn't here. seeing javi this weekend was great, but as much as I try to tell myself that I should be happy that I at least got to see him, I can't get rid of this hollow feeling. I think I've sighed in the past two and half weeks than I have in my entire life. but honestly, what will I tell mom and dad. I know that they support me but how am I going to say that after three weeks somewhere, I'm so unhappy and I just want to be somewhere else, preferably in oklahoma. I dunno, maybe I should just wait. it has only been three weeks, and you knew that you were a shy person. but eventually you'll start making friends like at home. I just wish I wasn't sad all the time. it makes me feel like I need to talk to dad about medicine again. I'm so sad. I hate it here. I just want to go back to normal. no matter what I do, like swimming the other day with jacob and alex. that was kinda cool, but I was still only mildly entertained. and as far as studying, I've always liked it, but now I depend on it way too much to keep me busy. oh yeah, I can't forget to go by the library today and ask for a job. if I don't get that done, it'll keep bothering me until I do. hopefully they'll have openings, because that would be the ideal place for me to work, I think. haha, everyone would laugh at me though. how perfect. Christine, working in a library. whatever, it sounds cool to me. my birthday. I wonder if we're going to have time to celebrate it this weekend. I hope Lee'or doesn't mind that I didn't call her. I should have called Dee dee back so that I could wish Lee'or good luck. oh well, she was getting married; I'm sure that she was so happy that she didn't even stop to think about it. I wonder what javi's doing right now. I    'm so glad he came this weekend. it was the best feeling. but then again, would it be worth it to change schools. I mean everyone is so pessimistic about this sort of stuff. should I even listen to them? I mean everyone said just break up before you leave. long distance doesn't work, but both javi and I ere so miserable. it caused more problems then staying together will. but I know what mom and dad would say. especially dad. he wants me to do well with business so badly. he is so proud. but I don't even want to do business! but then again, I dunno what exactly I want to do. except be with javi and start having some fun with this whole college"" experience that everyone raves about. so far, I'm a little disappointed. but I guess that's a little of my fault because all my motivation seems to have disappeared. except for good ol' school. at least I can judge that. I can't let them slip. my grades are what I can use to persuade my parents. that I at least tried the whole business thing, whatever. but now I'd rather do something interesting. ugh! business! yes, it's great. I got into UT business. wow! but if I can't even get excited about going to class, how am I going to get excited about getting up everyday of my life to do financial reports and stuff. oh blah! how boriiiinnngggg! how boring, how boring. but isn't that just perfect as well- I'm stuck between doing what I know is logically best and what I feel like doing. hmm, yeah, there are a lot of things on my mind. I always seemed a little stressed in high school. just trying to balance everything, but at least I had fun. I think if I were another person I probably wouldn't want to get to know me now either. despite the fact that I could get down before, I never doubted that overall, I was happy. now I just feel lonely. haha. maybe I should stop listening to coldplay. rush always said their music always makes someone sad. but I dunno, I really like the piano. and plus I have so many good memories from that one cd. I just need to listen to some more upbeat music I guess. maybe some  "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well here I am in the Undergraduate Library writing my Stream of Consciousness     paper. I still haven't really figured out yet what I will write about, but I suppose that     this type of paper isn't really supposed to have a meaning. That's good I guess,     right. Sure. It's cold in the computer lab here. It's always cold in this lab. And it's     always cold in the library. In most places throughout the University, in fact, it is     cold. It is especially cold in the student union. I mean -- ridiculously cold. it must     be about 70 degrees in there. There is one place, however, that I have found is     not cold - it is hot. My calculus class in the experimental sciences building it really     warm. And it doesn't really help that it is still like 90 degrees outside. One thing I     have noticed though, is that it is getting a little cooler outside. This is very good     news. Hopefully it will continue to get cooler. So looking at the timer at the top of     this page, I am beginning to realize that a twenty minute writing is quite a long     time, especially when you consider the fact that I really have no topic, nor have I     even begun to write on a topic. It's just meaningless facts from my mind. I'm sure     that this has some kind of meaning - this writing I mean. There must be some     point for this. Hopefully at least. So far my classes have been pretty good. I don't     have a huge workload yet. I assume that it will pick up eventually. Especially next     semester. From Laurel's experience, I have a feeling that next semester will be     quite a bit tougher than this one. Actually, I am quite certain that it will be rough. I     will be taking differential equations -- which Scheffer said was hard --  and     physics, which I know will be hard. Oh well, I can handle it. I am enjoying school,     though. It is quite a bit different than anything else I have experienced this far in     my life. All the freedom and extra time. I just like the atmosphere that is college. It's fun and different. Well only five minutes have gone by so far. I'm still a little     hungry. I should have had more lunch. Oh well. I only have one more class, and     it starts in 45 minutes and is only an hour. That's not too bad. I am writing on a     Macintosh computer right now. I didn't particularly want to use one, but it was     available, so I took it. They aren't too bad I suppose. It would take a little getting     used to. And the keys are quite a bit more sticky than I am used to. And the fact     that the mouse has only one button it a little odd. But the thing that I find most     interesting is the fact that Microsoft Internet Explorer is on an iMac. I had always     wondered if Microsoft put out programs on Apple's. Quite interesting indeed. Now     I'm pushing the 9 minute mark. Looking back, this is quite a bit of stuff I have     written in the last nine minutes. All pretty meaningless though. I think I may just     stop looking at the clock for a while because it is a little depressing. You know the     feeling - staring at the clock makes time just crawl by. Quite annoying I must say. During swim practice we used to not like to look at the clock because it would     remind us of how much time we had left in practice. Especially with Coach Hutch. Man he was a killer. I think that was the hardest year that I ever had with     swimming. Funny thing is -- I didn't get a whole lot faster. I got faster with coach     Wilson -- as much as I hate to say it. OK I give -- I looked at the clock. Now I only     have nine minutes left to write. That's promising I guess. I wonder how the swim     team is doing now. With the girls and the guys separated and all. I wonder if the     girls like the new coach, and how the guys are dealing with Kyle again. The guy     behind me has more I'M's up than I have ever seen. He seriously must be talking     with at least ten people - probably more. The whole screen is flashing  and     lighting up all the time. Crazy. This whole Macintosh thing is kind of getting to me. I can't stand this keyboard. It is so sticky!  Every other word, I have to go back and     fix it because the key didn't register. I also keep going back because I keep     forgetting to add capital letters and such. I am used to a program fixing it all for     me. Oh well I suppose it's good for me. But this sticky keyboard is not. Geez!  If     you can't tell, it is starting to bother me. And they crazy IMer is still typing away to     like 50 of his closest friends. It's funny what you notice people do when you just sit     back and watch for a minute. (6 minutes left)  One good thing I will say is that     Macintosh's do look pretty cool. I like the whole clear theme. I also like the     widescreen. It's pretty cool, and is very clear and bright. I think the clock on the     computer is slow. After 20 real"" seconds - by my watch - the clock lost 5 seconds. So for every ""real"" minute, 75 seconds go by. So in a 20 minute writing sample, I     must actually write for about 25 minutes. See I thought this was an abnormally      long time to write. I thought that my watch said 12:01 when I started, and now it is     12:37 and I still have 2 minutes to write. Maybe this thing loses even more time     than five seconds for every twenty seconds. That's crazy. I have a one o'clock     class. I hope that my ""2"" minutes doesn't last too much longer. Well in conclusion,     this writing experience has been. well. real - to say  the least. I have to say that     I have never written a stream of consciousness paper before, so this was a first. I     don't know that I like it that much either. I have noticed that when I type on the     computer that the seconds don't even move at all. So I have been writing for a     loooong time. Ok, my time is up. Bye. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, I guess I get to finally do a reading assignment for psychology. I always wondered what's done with these assignments. whether they test us students for mental illness or just conduct some research on us as though we're guinea pigs. Oh well, I guess it's a good way in any case to get us involved, since it is part of our grade. Man, my back is feeling kind of itchy now from walking and riding around campus all day. I can't really concentrate for, wow, eighteen more minutes, since I've had quite a lack of sleep over the past few days. It's getting harder and harder to stay awake as the days go by. The thing that bothers me is that all my classes have more than three hundred students except for one of them, so there really is no one to keep me awake except maybe the occasional glance from the professor. I've been mostly lucky about getting good ones. I'm getting a bit hungry now but the time is keeping me in, and my stomach is starting to growl. Hmm, spaghettios or mac and cheese, or should I finally start off with something healthy, I mean there is a whole fridge full of food. maybe an apple, then some pasta. That would sound good. I need to do something to keep my freshman 15 off, maybe the occasional biking and the insane walking I do every day might work off those hamburgers. This computer screen is making my eyes blurry, and I'm now slowly falling asleep. Aww man, I actually have to stay awake today in order to pass my quiz tomorrow in theatre. It shouldn't be too bad. I don't even know if I'm supposed to be doing punctuation or capitalizing the words. It's not like this is an official paper, but since I'm a perfectionist I can't really deal with things that are out of line or place. I guess it only works on AOL because it's just faster to type this way. I just realized that I get off track too easily, I may have some form of ADD. I can barely even listen to myself talk for 20 minutes. It's really hard when I'm face to face with someone. I just can't stand in one place for that long. So, I just zone out. as I'm doing now. I'm slowly becoming less aware and careful of what I write. People sometimes think I'm drunk when I'm sending them mail, like when I sent a post card to a few friends back home while I was backpacking through Europe this summer with my brother. Where is he by the way? Oh yeah, he went to work today. I live with him, I thought it'd be hard since we always used to fight when we were little. I'd always want what he had and vice versa. So, when we were in Europe, we were good at some points bought kind of fought a majority of the time. I guess the difference here is that . um I lost my track of thought, oh yeah, that we have separate rooms so we don't have to really see each other all the time. Just a moment, I need to change my posture. I'm becoming less attentive to myself. that's better. I wonder where my dog is, it's usually good to have him by my side. He is fluffy and fun to pet, well, at least he is there to substitute for my brother and keeps me company. That reminds me, I was supposed to walk him when I got home, but I haven't come around to doing that. I'll just go in 6 minutes when this is over. He can wait awhile. I wish I was a dog, he doesn't need anything but the occasional love, food, water, and he gets to sleep whenever he wants. I want to just take a while to lounge. I don't even get to do that much in the summer. I'm always active, either moving around, hanging out, or traveling. which I like a lot. Oh, I forgot to ask my adviser about the study abroad program. I'm a big language freak, in French at least, after I've finished learning that I want to do Italian and maybe Spanish. I'm slowly losing my Russian though, since my parents aren't there with me every evening to talk to. I need to move around a bit, my butt is getting sore from the chair. I need to get a new chair finally, this one just isn't doing it. Twenty minutes is a lot longer than I thought, I wonder how much I've written already. It seems like my fingers haven't stopped moving for quite a while. It's a renewed sensation since I haven't played piano for a while. I need to finally get one of those too for my apartment. or else I'll forget how to do that too. It's weird how something you've done nearly your entire life can disappear so quickly. Yay, only a few more seconds left to write, 10 , 8, 5, 2, 1. Done "
Tell me about yourself.,"I find it hard to write what I am thinking probably because I am always thinking of several things and it is hard to focus on one. But this weekend's events seem to come to mind. I had a really fun weekend. It is not just that I hate school and I needed a break, I honestly don't feel like I am really in college. I just feel like I am going through the motions. It hasn't really set in yet. But right not I am at a friends apartment where a couple of my friends and I have stayed these past couple of nights. A friend is watching Office Space in the background and I love that movie. It is a great movie and I find it amazing how you can relate much of your life to that movie. I just realized how dramatic I find my life. I make a big deal out of little things. I guess it is my way of dealing with the stress in my life. I make things into a huge deal so it seems too ridiculous to be upset about something that it doesn't bother me anymore. Especially when it comes to boys. I find them to be a huge headache. When a relationship doesn't work out I find it easier to be upset and hurt about it and make it not a big deal because once I am finished ranting and raving, it seems kind of silly. Besides it is easier to be upset at someone than it is to try and get over those feelings you had for them. But the thing about that is you can't hate them. Because in order to hate someone you have to have significantly cared for them at one time or another. The people that hurt you the most are the people that are the closest to you. And I don't want to the people I am mad to know that they have impacted my life to the extent where I am capable of hating them for hurting me. I don't know, it may sound complicated, but it works for me. Some people think I am a very complicated person, but I don't think I am. I consider myself to be an honest person and in return I expect your honesty in return. Don't bother lying to me. Don't waste my time. Time is always something that I lack. There aren't enough hours in the day. Ever since college I find myself sleeping at doing homework and hanging out at odd hours of the day. Just yesterday my friends and I went to 6th Street, went to eat and then came back to our friends apartment to swim at 6:00 in the morning. But I guess that is college. I am really looking forward to what the year holds for me. People here in Austin are really nice. There are some weirdoes, but overall I like it here. I think I made the right decision about college. Life is great. It really is. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Why can I not think of anything to type the moment when I click the start link? This is so weird, I just hungry everytime after I am done showering. Why is that? Is it because while I am showering my body also takes the food away from my stomach? I wonder why my feet are so smelly even though I have already taken a shower. My roommate seems to be busy all the time and never seem to have any time to chill or hang out with me and some other people. I think that guy in the SPE meeting today was pretty cute. Hopefully I will be able to meet him sometime. Wow, it is getting pretty late right now and I am getting a little bit sleepy. I took the Pretesting for the psychology required experiment testing and it was really long! It was so detailed that I was about to give up and continue it some other time and go to sleep instead. Man, I really don't know what to do about Calculus. I seem to be struggling in all of my math classes and if I still don't get help by next Monday, I will be screwed. I feel kind of floaty? Is that the word to describe it? My feet are really cold right now, I wonder why. My hands are a little cold too. Hmm. I think it's because that the temperature in this room is getting lower and lower. I really want the temperature to go up a little more if not it's going to be freezing in here like my other friends' dorms at Jester West. Man. I still have 3 more classes tomorrow but good thing that I don't have any classes on Friday! Yay! I think I am going to return the dark blue flip-flops since it seems to be hard for me to find something that will match with it. If not, I can ask my sister if she wants to buy it from me or not. Hopefully she would want it so then I wouldn't have to make a trip back to the mall to return it. I am feeling really tired and sleepy right now. I wish I can go to sleep but I have to get some work done before it will be too late. Hopefully I will be able to go back to Houston sometime this or next weekend. I really want to see my cute little brother! I miss him a lot! Ouch, my right arm is aching now. I think it's because I have been using the computer too much and typing a lot. I think I really do need a break from the computer. Where is he? I really want to talk to him but it seems like he is either always away or I talk to him and he never replies. That is really annoying. My contacts feel a kind of weird. I think I should take them out and put on my glasses instead. Hmm. I really do wonder why my roommate has to leave that music on forever. Is it because it soothes her from all of the pain and stress through out the day? That's probably the reason why. I really do wonder why she wants to be a vegetarian. I think it's quite interesting even though I really don't think I can live without eating any meat in my life. Meat is just too good. I wonder why one of my friends today acted kind of strange. I think she probably felt bad for me for not being able to make it in time to eat dinner with me or it's probably because that she wants to find out something that has to do with either me or this other friend of mine. I think that it really annoys me a lot when she acts in this immature way and causes me to not be able to trust her even more. A few of my friends on AIM are messaging me and I am trying to reply to them even though I am concentrating on typing this up. She was asking me about whether I will be going to the next football game or not. Should I go? But I think that the tickets is going to be rather expensive but going to one wouldn't be that bad since I have never gone to one before. Man. it's only been a few days of my first classes in college and I am gradually starting to hate it. Why do college math professors just scribble random things on the board? I mean can they at least have a little bit more organization? It makes me so confused on understanding the material and I can't even figure out how to solve the homework problems. I wish I can change my calc professor but I think that is going to be impossible. Ouch, both of my arms hurt now, I think I should be getting off the computer really soon. An individual sports package? What is that? For 40 dollars? I really don't know if I should get it because I don't really want to spend all of my money on football tickets. All right, I think my time is almost up and I am so happy I can go to sleep now!  "
Tell me about yourself.,"My feelings and thoughts about everything in general are very complicated or confusing. I have thoughts of school work which seems to be very normal as being a freshman in this huge world. I feel lost sometimes, not in school but in general. Lost as in a sense do I belong in this society or will I make a difference in the world?  I feel betrayed from lovers and friends. I feel loved my family members but also frightened that I will not make them proud. I have done everything I can to be the person that I can be and I am scared that they will not accept me for. I feel that I have lived their life and they are pushing me to become what they didn't. I feel hurt and I wish that they would just let me go and be just me"". I feel that they are holding me back from the rest of the world. Why won't they just let me survive by myself? Why do they continuously brand me as this little girl who will never do anything wrong?  I think that it is all out of love but I am scared that if they keep this up that I will not want to go back to them and live life on my own. Smells that I have come across are well just the typical smells. Food, sweat, laundry on the way to my room, and sweet smells of different types of perfumes, detergent, soap, and whatever else people have. Inner smells I have come across are aromas of hard work and dedication. I see people and how they react to things. I see their facial expressions and I realize that they are human to. I can smell the fear or excitement in them. I can sense the fragility or strengths in them. I can smell a sense of belonging and acceptance. As I walk every day around campus and I look back on my life, I realize that I have worked up to this level and I am satisfied with my self. I look at the upper classmen and I realize that soon I will be in their place. I will be the head of the school holding a torch as the new students arrive setting a path for them to follow. I will be a leader and a part of the legend of the University of Texas at Austin. I will be a hero in accomplishing the difficult and the easy. I will be a survivor. I also think about life in general. I thank the LORD every night that I am alive and experiencing this great joy. I can hear my parents approval and my family's cry for love and if they could only be here while I live the life of a college student starting fresh in this huge society. I thank GOD every day that I have parents and a family that support me and back me up in everything that I do and that I will do. I thank GOD for my friends that accept me for who I am and that they will not change for me or anyone else. I thank GOD for the will power and the confidence that I am able to hold my head up proud and strong. I thank HIM for the love and affection of others. I thank HIM for the ability to be able to be myself. To have a life of my own and the free will to make decisions. I tell myself that I am lucky to be in the place I am in. I thank him for allowing me to make the right choices along the way leading me in this direction and that I may be able to stay in this direction. I thank HIM for keeping me healthy and alive. I think that I am a person full of faith and serenity. I am person full of heart and love. Like my name means, I am a person of ""STRENGTH"". I find it funny because I am a person that stands exactly 5 feet and I am tiny. But inside I am full of life and energy. I am strong in nature and in love. I am strong on the inside as well as the outside. I was brought up to be strong in the mind as well as in the body. I am a warrior of many things and I am a survivor like I said before. I am a lady, a friend, an athlete, a motivator, as well as a person of high standards. I am not anyone else nor do I desire to be. I am who I am and I am proud of that. I am many things but most of all I am ""ME"". "
Tell me about yourself.,"So here I am sitting at my computer. I am supposed to be doing my homework that I put off all week, I guess you could call this homework though. Its a little cold in here, I haven't taken a shower yet. I hope my roommate doesn't just come home and I'm still sitting here in my pajamas. she goes to san antonio every weekend to see her family and boyfriend. I wish I could go home to see my family and friends. but I don't have the money. I hate my job. I wish it were more like my old job at home. scott was so nice there and here tj just seems like a jerk. maybe I'll get transferred to a closer store. probably not though. I'm hungry and my feet are cold. I wonder why it is that whenever I get hungry I get cold, or maybe its the other way around, whenever I get cold I get hungry. I don't think the second floor dining opens until 4:30, if even that, I can't remember the hours for the weekend. my cell phone is ringing. I really wish my new cell phone would get here. ever since I dropped this one on the way to class it just randomly calls and hangs up and sends me messages, most of them are old by the time I get them, or were sent earlier in the day. I should really take a shower, I feel sticky. I think its from the ice cream. I just finished watching solaris. it was an ok movie, not as good as greg said it was going to be but interesting at least. the whole basis of it was that your basis of reality isn't really what reality is, and who's to determine what reality is anyways. its a pretty far fetched concept. and on a better day I might think about that, but today I've got bigger things to worry about. I like biology, dr pierson is very focused on teaching us to learn, which I think is cool for a professor. they tell you in high school that when you get to college, especially a big college like this one that you are all on your own and if you haven't developed good study skills before you get here you are for sure going to fail. but its just not true. I would have thought people here would be less worried about how we were doing and how we were understanding things, but everyone seems to really care. I wonder how long that will last. that's another thing about living here. in dallas no one really cares. I mean duncanville sure people do, its a smaller town, but if you were to go downtown and ask someone for directions they would probably think you were crazy. here people are much more friendly. just yesterday I was riding the bus home from wal-mart and you know riding the metro's around here you run into all kinds of strange and interesting people, and this older black guy and a group of punk kids gets on the bus. and the kids were so rude to him, and talking to him like he was stupid and making fun of him right to his face and everything. they didn't know him anymore than I did, and sure it was apparent that all of his crayons weren't in the box but it amazed me how disrespectful they were to him. so I said something, and it wasn't even mean, I just started asking them how old they were and how much they thought they knew in the few years they had lived. none of them answered of course, and it really wasn't my place to say, but they shut up. now they got off the bus quickly, but the older guy stayed on and talked to me for awhile. he was nice enough, he had some sort of speech issue. it was like talking to my grandpa after his stroke but much faster. I couldn't tell if he didn't know the words or if his brain couldn't unscramble the words. that's what my grandpa used to say. he didn't talk much after his last stroke, and the doctors couldn't help him if he couldn't tell them what he wanted. and finally one day my mom asked him why he looked angry all the time. and he told her he knew what he wanted to say but when he opened his mouth to say it it came out all scrambled up. so it had to sit and think about it a second time to be sure it came out right. and it wore him down and it made him tired so he just didn't say much. he understood everything we were saying but the delay for him aggravated him so he didn't want to deal with it. its sad ya know. he is very smart, and he is seen so much to tell about, I hope he gets thru this. my mom says he is getting better. I think probably one of the worst diseases must be alztiemers. I know that's not what he is got, but just this small glimpse is scary to me. I couldn't' imagine living thru it. hopefully by the time I get that old they will have figured out a way to fix it. why did I buy two packs of gum?  I went to Wal-Mart yesterday and for whatever reason I bought two packs of gum. I don't' even chew gum that often. maybe I bought one for aida. she is probably going to come home soon, I think she was catching the 3pm bus out of san antonio. I'm going home next weekend. I'm supposed to catch a bus at 4 and get to dallas at 7:45. I guess we'll have to make some stops because I've never gone to dallas or to here and it taken longer than 3 hours. but I probably speed a little. and tj is just going to have to deal with me not being here. I told him two weeks ago not to schedule me on Friday, sat, or sundays because I didn't know when I was going out of town. and what did he do?  schedule me for this Friday. well I already bought the tickets and if I don't go home this weekend I'm going to go crazy. I miss the stupid things, like tricia singing in the shower. that child is so tone deaf its not even funny. or mom knowing all the lyrics to every disney channel song. I miss my chinchilla. his name is mistletoe. I got him for christmas two years ago from my biological father. I don't talk to him anymore. I wonder if he even knows I'm here. samantha knows, I remember telling her last christmas. that's what sux about all this though. I mean its bad that me and russell can't work things out, but that's our issue, but because of it I can't talk to samantha, which isn't fair to her. what did she ever do to deserve this?  it wasn't her choice. and nobody ever asked her. what will she think when she grows up and I haven't been there for her prom and her college years and all that. will she blame me?  I don't know. well I should really go take a shower. my roommate is coming soon. thanks for listening. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well I'm sitting at my computer and I don't really have much to say. For some reason I feel as though my mind is completely blank. My roommate just walked out the door and he is about to get ready for class. I am so tired right now. Last night I was up with no thoughts in my head. I was just not able to sleep for some reason. I really hope that this school year goes good for me. I know it is going to be tough but it will be worth it. I have always dreamt of coming to college and now that I am finally here it still seems like a dream. I guess its just hard to believe that I'm on my own, six hours from home. I miss my old friends and my girlfriend, Laura, I can't wait to see here this weekend. Football season is about to start and I am getting so excited to see my first Longhorn game. My mind just went blank again. no thoughts. I think I just used to many dots between words. My nose itches. I need to use the bathroom, but I still have eleven minutes to go on this assignment, and I don't want to stop now. For some reason it seems as though I have been here typing for a long time but really I haven't even typed much. Maybe I type slow. I'm trying to think of what to type now. It seems so easy. ?Just type what you are thinking at the moment?, maybe I'm trying to hard. The phone is ringing. I guess I'll get it. it is was my mom. Yes, she is going to put money in my bank account. That sounds good to me because I could really use it right now. It looks as though I have barely typed anything. I'm not sure how long this should be or what the instructor expects out of this piece of writing. Man I'm thirsty. I could use a spite or a cold coke. Maybe I'll go get one in a little while, or not cause I need to save money. It's tough not having a job and wanting so much. I'm just used to having money to spend on so much stuff that I don't even need in the first place. Six more minutes and I will be done. It actually seems like a long time, but so far it has gone by pretty quick. I wonder how my dog is doing. I hope my mom is feeding her just as I said, and giving her lots of water. She needs that especially in the hot sun. I can't wait to go home and have her jump on me. No thoughts. still none. I think I'm getting addicted to the dot thing. Two more minutes to go and now my eyes are glued to the clock. Every second seems to go by slower and slower now. I really don't want to drive home this weekend. I wish I could fly, but I'll be alright. I just really don't like driving six hours it gets really boring just sitting there doing nothing but paying attention to the road. Well it's been twenty minutes so I guess I'm done. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I've never sat here like this before and jotted down my thoughts. Despite them being my thoughts, I don't think much about them. Every time I hear my roommate, Charles, play the saxophone, I think of my brother Marlon back at home. (I thought of this because he is practicing on it now. )  School. This year I'm trying to make straight A's because I crashed and burned my 1st two semesters. Some say it wasn't really a crash and burn. I received a 2. 4 G. P. A. It's definitely not what I was aiming at. I don't know what's wrong though. I set aside a lot of time to study, but I could just never pull through on tests. Some people suggested I have ADD. I always think about whether or not I have ADD. I've usually dismiss the possibility that I do, because that might be just the easy"" way out. What if it's not ADD?  Just me having bad study habits. I don't know. I always worry about school. 'm going to see a counselor about it. Crew. I can't wait 'till tomorrow morning. We have another practice with Texas Rowing Crew bright and early in the morning. 5:30 practice that is. I found seven people that are trying out for crew too that are living in my apartment complex. In one building over no less. Heather just left. I just got back from dropping her off. Heather's my girlfriend of 2 yrs going on 3. She plays goaltender on the St. Edwards girls soccer team and is having a tournament in Oklahoma for the weekend, getting back late Sunday night. Charles stopped, and is now watching television in the living room. I think that is one reason I can hardly get any studying done in this apartment. There are too many distractions. Plus my bed is so comfortable. Having to wake up so early sort of makes me tired. I learned today that people with a regular sleep cycle tend to have better concentrations than do people with a sporadic sleep cycle. That's what I have. On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, I wake up at 4:30 and on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday, I wake up at 7:30. I never gave much attention to my sleeping habits, but now I'm taking a study strategies course that is hopefully going to help me make better grades. I want to make straight A's this semester because in doing so, it will raise my G. P. A. to a 2. 7. Still no where near where I want to be, but its a start in the right direction. 10 more minutes. Speaking of sleepiness, I am feeling very, very sleepy right now. My eyes are getting heavy and my head is tilting. But I'm fighting it because I am in the middle of an assignment. I just looked at Professor Pennebaker's old tests and I do not remember going over some of those things in the book or in lecture. I hope that there was a different curriculum last year. Psychology is the only class I'm all too worried about. I feel like I have no control in this class. I feel like this class overburdens me. I'm used to reading material and having the professor reiterate what I had just learned. I guess that's something about college everybody has to learn. I just don't want to learn it the hard way. So I'm starting to form a study group. I really think these will help a lot. Although I hope the other people in the group are not thinking I'm using them for their notes. I'm not a good note taker, and I'll probably want to copy them from them. I also formed more study groups in each of my 4 classes. I'm a 12 hour student. That's another thing that gets me all depressed. I feel I might have clinical depression. It's something I'm checking out with a counselor next thursday. Four more minutes. I'm getting even more and more tired than ever. I will definitely nap after this writing assignment. My glasses are bothering me and my throat is so dry. My brain is going on hold for a second as I take a swig of water. Ok. I bought one of those Nalgene water bottles. What's the deal with those anyway?  They make them so expensive, and I see everybody has one. So, naturally, I had to get one for myself. Two more minutes. I am counting down this assignment to be over because I'm just that tired. I am assuming their will be some sort of punishment to press the finish button early, so I stop myself from doing that. Wow, 50 seconds. I am very ready to take a nap. 30 seconds. Almost there. Man, I'm going to have to get Charles to shut that TV up when I  "
Tell me about yourself.,"right now, I am in a really good mood, I don't really know why because this morning I was so dead, and I thought I would feel like that all day, but I woke up sometime between biology and economics. last night sucked. everyone else was having so much fun, but I was exhausted and just couldn't really get into it. I don't know how people do it every night!  I am so worn out every day!  I just need to take a few days off to sleep. I am so mad that our zeta retreat is the weekend of austin city limits!  I have to get out of it somehow. my stomach kind of hurts right now, and I really need to go running, so I hope it goes away. my friend megan has an eating disorder I think. she constantly tells us how much weight she is lost recently, and its getting so annoying. I really miss zachary. thank god he called and woke me up this morning or else I would have never woken up. and I really miss my dog. I think I have an unhealthy relationship with my dog. thank god I'm taking psychology. haha I literally miss her more than my parents!  I hope fiji is fun tonight. it probably will be. I always have the most fun with the fiji guys. they are so nice and fun to hang around with. it is such a nice day outside. I would much rather be out enjoying it then writing this. just kidding!  it was not cool last night when so many people came into my room and woke me up! I was in such a deep sleep too! no wonder I was tired this morning. okay now my roommate is going outside. just like I wanted to!  she is cool as shit. she is just so herself, and I think that's awesome. sometimes I wish I could be more like that. I am a fairly independent person, but I know I follow the trend a lot too. I hope I do well at the tryouts for the dance team. that would be so cool! I miss dance so much!  I can't believe I quit - I am such an idiot! dance was always such an outlet for me and when I quit, things kind of started going downhill, so hopefully I can start back up. I seriously think I've gained the freshman 100!  for some reason when I get stressed out I start to eat. a lot. I need to get control!  I think its so funny how all of the girls from hardin house and srd are constantly at towers. I love living here, it is so free and fun all the time. it's so weird how music means so much to some people and so little to others. I think I'm kind of in between. I love music, but it certainly isn't my life. there are definitely times in my life when music plays a key role. ugh. cooper, why did he become so annoying!?  he used to be so funny and nice. I wonder what my sister is doing right now. I miss her about the same as I miss my pooch. she is so sweet. I hope she is okay. I worry about her all the time, I just hope she is okay. it worries me how introverted she is. I am the complete opposite!  I spill my guts to anyone that will listen and she won't open up to anybody. I know that she is going through a really hard time right now with mom and papa, and with me leaving. god she looked up to me so much :(  I really need to stretch. I think running will be good for me today. I need to burn off some steam for sure. I wonder how molly is doing. I haven't talked to her in awhile. I feel bad because she called me a lot when school started, and I was always so busy and couldn't' ever call her back. now she hasn't been answering when I call, so I hope she is at least having fun. I bet she is met so many hot colorado guys. why can't I find a guy?  they are all so worthless. all the freshmen guys care about right now is pledging and getting a piece of ass. both of which I am not going to do right now. well except for pledging. duh. zeta. why didn't I get my first choice!  I really want to know what I did wrong. all of my friends got their first choice, and I am really nice and outgoing, it should have been a breeze. why did I spill my guts that night about it to nathan. I am such a dumbass. oh well, it happens to the best of us. well time to go run! "
Tell me about yourself.,"Ummm this is sorta weird. I think its odd that we have to write for 20 minutes about what is going through are heads. I know that sometimes I don't know that I am thinking about something. but I am sure that it is happening. Like when I exercise. I normally don't think about any thing? Or am I? Great now everytime I exercise I am going to think about what I am thinking about and that is going to take away from the effort I put into my workouts. Damm. I should have stayed at the gym longer today. 30 minutes of cardio is not enough. I was not as tired as a seemed. I could be there right now, still burning calories away on the weights or cardio. Are we supposed to go back and read this for mistakes or just submit it because I keep rereading what I wrote that doesn't seem like what we are supposed to be doing. Oh well, I'm a horrible typer. Uhhhhhhh that shower felt good a bit ago but I wish that I had brushed my hair before I decided to start typing. its hanging all around my face and its annoying. Wonder what the meeting is going to be like tonight. I wonder how much different it will be then Crew. Do I really want to get involved in rowing again? Yes. Do I want to do it with a team? Yes. Why because I push myself harder but I also get tired easier. Grades are important. But so is having fun. Rowing = fun. Women's rowing. supposedly they pay for it all, all the costs. What if they don't? Then I can't be on it, that will suck, then I will be sad and then I will have to do something else. But all the other organizations suck. I don't want to be with a bunch of stupid snotty girls in some lame sorority. I work for my money and pay for my car and cloths and food. Those girls whose parents pay for everything suck. I wish my parents could afford to pay 2000 a semester for me to be in something like that but no because I am a normal college student. Man rich people make me mad. I am never going to be rich. I have to do rowing I have to. ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm that was exciting. stupid sorority girls I am glad I punched hilary in the face. I really hope she has a huge bruise on her jaw. But I shoulda stayed there and let her take a swing at me instead of walking away like a little pussy. Naw, there was too many guys around there is no way that they would have let me hit her again. Especially after how hard I hit her the first time. I wish she had taken a swing at me though. That would have been exciting. I could tell everyone that I got in a fight with a girl. Not like I am trying to fight with people or anything. But she had no right to write that shit on my sisters shirt and tif was just going to take it. man if I was in tifs spot and hilary had written that on my shirt I would have had someone immediately tell me what it said I would have hunted her down in the party and whooped her so bad. but because tif isn't like me I had to do it instead. That makes no sense. It sucks having a twin. Wait it doesn't suck but I don't understand. Why did I get so mad about that. Would I have done that if hilary had written that on Audreys shirt? Probably not. Interesting. Ohhhhhh psychology could make an interesting case study out of me right now. Haha twins. why are people so interested in studying us. We are two separate people. Can't they understand that. I am glad that I didn't participate in that testing they wanted us to do last year. No way are you going to get me to sit in a sound proof room by myself with wires attached to my head, by myself for 1 hour. HA. You would have to pay me more then 40 to do that. And then they wanted me to answer a set of personal and non personal questions about myself. ohh they would remain confidential. So  I don't want ANYBODY knowing about my sex life, drug use or problems or things I do to stay happy and be fit. That is my business. Man. and then they want to compare all my information to my sisters. the good twin and try to make me look bad. I can see it in the journal article now. 'A study at the university of texas reveals that twins have opposite personalities. If one had used drugs in the past this proves that. blah blah blah if one is fatter this means. blah blah blah. Erhhhhh I am not sure exactly how much I am going to like this class since it has to do with studying stuff like that. Man I am worried now about what I just wrote everything is so negative and m,ean. I am really not like that I am not in a bad mood either . it just feels like since we have to write this is all the stuff that I have been thinking about when FORCCED to write. I don't always think as mush as I have in the past 20 minutes. great almost done 30 seconds left. I am going to type really slow now just to finish. 20. glad I'm done  "
Tell me about yourself.,"This is my first year at UT Austin, and I feel nervous and confused about what is to come. I am not accustomed to all this work and it is really making me worried because I cannot keep up in all my classes. For one, I have so much to do in all my classes, and two, I live off-campus and it takes at least an hour to get back to my apartment. My roommates a complete slob and he leaves his stuff everywhere around the house; just yesterday I notice he is been eating out of some fried chicken that was left over from last saturday and has been sitting out on the counter for 5 days!             I also want to keep up with my friends, but it is so hard because there is so much work. They're always asking me to go party with them on the weekends, but that is not something that I like to do. I don't drink and I don't plan on to and I am not interested in meeting girls because I am currently happy in my relationship. I've been going out with her for 10 months and one day. She is the best thing that has ever happened to me; sometimes I feel as if she cares for me then I care for myself. I've never felt like this before, specially with a member of the opposite sex. I don't have good looks to attract girls, but from what people tell me, I have a good personality. I listen to what others have to say. I listen to their problems and try to help them with their problems - I am not just saying this to suck up to a psychology professor, but I really do this. I am majoring in psychology; it is what I really want to do. Back to my girlfriend, she is currently going to UTSA and will be transferring to UT next year. What really bugs me though is how whenever I go to see her, my friends are always bugging me about Hey man, are you going to smash her?"" and my answer is ""NO. "" You can call me old-fashioned but I believe in abstinence. I am a virgin. It bugs others, but it doesn't bug me. I don't get how people can make love to multiple girls and not feel dirty about it. I know I would. I would never have sex with my girlfriend before we get married. I want to have that respect for her and just restrain myself from that. I mean, don't get me wrong, I love her. I want to make love to her, but I am not going to. I have morals. I was raised in a culture where dating was frowned upon. My parents had no problems with it as long as I didn't do anything - and I don't. I really like this girl, and I have thought of a future with her in the long run and I do not want to compromise that. I just wish that she would be here with me. As you can see, she means a lot to me and she is on my mind a lot. My major is psychology, but eventually I want to become a pediatrician or maybe even a psychiatrist - I don't know yet. It worries me that I will have to stay in school for another 8 years and that is a real long time but I feel that it is worth it, so I do not want to give up. I will try my best. Now I am sitting here not knowing how to word this paper because I am so accustomed to High School writing with 5 paragraphs and an introductory and conclusion, but the assignment was to simply state my feelings - so I am. It is raining outside right now. I hope it doesn't rain tomorrow because I have classes. It would not be fun walking drenched to philosophy 301 with Professor Bonevac. Philosophy also seems like an interesting class for me. Professor Bonevac is hilarious and is awesome to listen to (as you are). The rats with altered hypothalamuses were hilarious and they really made me think about all the technology that is out there. I know I am doing the right thing by taking all the classes I am to pursue my career. I am scared that my grades won't be able to cut it though. All these classes require a lot of reading, and reading isn't exactly my best subject. I am trying my best to keep up and continue with all the reading and continue with turning in my assignments on time. It is really hard but I think I should be all right. I am especially worried about this class, because the lectures are completely different from the textbook and I have to keep up on both and well - I am just a confused little man. My times running out and my brain is struggling to squeeze words out to finish up this assignment. I also have a chemistry exam tomorrow. YES tomorrow. So hopefully I'll do good at that because it seems relatively easy. I miss my parents. They are back in Houston. They don't want me to go visit them because they don't want me adding mileage to the car. So I am stuck in  Austin til Thanksgiving. I'll go home, eat turkey, and come back sick. Yes, I do listen in class. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, I have procrastinated on doing this assignment for long enough, and so I guess I should start working on it now. It's a thursday afternoon and all I'm doing is staying at the apartment to do this assignment. What a life! These stupid pop-ups keep on coming up, it's interrupting my thinking process. Let's see, I've been up here for about a month now, and I have yet been able to see and fun"" that everyone that went here or is going here claim. It's not that I want to be partying everyday, still I would like to see what's all the fuss's about. Then again, my life here at the apartment is great. I live with two roommates, each have their own eccentricity, still without them I would be bored out of my mind. These restaurants around here keep on posting flyers in front of my door- it's getting really annoying. I'm hungry, yet I don't want to go grab something to eat - does that make me lazy? Of course not! It's because I have to sit here for 20 minutes to write this assignment, yea that's it. During the day this place is so quiet, almost everyone that's living here goes to UT, so during the day they're at the campus. Maybe I should spend more time at the campus. Maybe that would help me get to know more people. I haven't made one single friend yet, well besides those people that I see in class everyday, those that I greet with a casual hello; however, I don't think of them as friends, just acquaintances. My computer desk keeps on shaking while I'm typing this, I should have brought a sturdier desk, but then how would it fit in here? This place is so cramped. Luckily, this weekend I'm going back home to Houston to get a bunk bed, and also to see my family and girlfriend of course. I miss my family very much, especially my dad. He have always been the strict yet caring figure that shadows every minute of my life up till now. Now, I have to be on my own, that's the only way that I will learn to grow up. I know he must be worried out of his mind right now, wondering what I'm doing up here, wondering how my health is, wondering how I'm doing in school, wondering how late I sleep, wondering how many times I eat in a day, etc. I know he worries, but the best I can do is call him every night just to let him know that I'm doing fine. I can't go back home, if I live with him, then he will take care of everything for me, then I will never learn to grow up. I miss my mom too, but I'm more attached to my dad because he is the only other male in our family of seven. The buses hear run pretty frequently, I just heard another bus pass by our apartment, this is pretty convenient. My roommate just got home, he is the bossy but cool one out of us. I'm like the normal one, well, besides my random outburst of course. My other roommate is the cool, quiet subtle one. It's always fun to pick on him, but we know our limits. Oh yea, VSA meeting is today, maybe I will get to know more people. Then again, I doubt it because I'm always quiet and reserved so I guess I won't talk much. Well, I'm going to wrap this up because the timer's about to run out. After this, I'm going to head to class, then it's VSA meeting. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, lets see, what am I thinking. All I ever really have time to think about is school. I am so stressed out, since I changed to pre-pharm my courses have completely changed, I'm reading for hours each day and I'm not a big reader"", I read very slow, and I have absolutely no reading comprehension what so ever. To top it all off I have three tests on the same day, this one is two days before that and I have another one the thursday before that. Talk about brain overload. One thing that's good is that a lot of the science stuff I'm reading in all 3 classes and some of it I'm finding in my psych readings too. It's all just overwhelming. This week I have to do all this lil sis stuff for my sorority. I was supposed to decorate her room yesterday but I had class from 12-5 so she was home when I was done with class, so I'll be doing that later and I have to buy all this stuff for it too, I don't have a job, I don't make money, and I don't feel like I should ask my parents for more. The big money problem started with my boyfriend, he owes me $700, that's a lot of money I could really use. I could maybe go and do something for myself, go out to eat occasionally, go rent a movie once and a while but no, I have all this other crap I have to pay for like bills and he can't understand that. He is not in school, he should a job, why to I have to loan him money, well no more-EVER. Well at least not until I get my money back. To top it all off he messed up something with probation and now he is in jail, I don't a boyfriend who's in jail, I want someone with my same goals in mind, someone in school, someone who cares about where they'll be in 5-10 years. But it's so hard because I love him, or at least I think it's love, it has to be or else I wouldn't put up with all his crap. It's not just all that, I'm somewhat of a neat freak and I like things to be clean and keep things the way I have them but everytime he does something that upsets me and not just that, it's stuff I've asked to either do or not do hundreds of times and he somehow thinks that he can get mad because I'm mad at him, well if would listen to me and try to clean up after himself and common courtesy things like that I would even get upset. Now he keeps saying are things going to ok when I get out blah, blah, blah. I don't know if things don't think at least somewhat better than I can't put myself through this anymore, the stress he causes is probably close to or equal to what I get from school, I don't need that-school is a big enough pain in my side. I should probably end it, I know I won't cry-I'll miss him but I've already cried enough for him. You know the saying-the only guy worth crying for will never make you cry. I don't know we'll just have to see what things are like. One good thing that came from him is my kitty, Bailey. One of his friends couldn't keep her so I took her. She is the cutest most mischievous thing ever. I feel so bad though, she got spayed and declawed on monday. She is doing better she is walking almost completely back to normal, not really limping anymore but I still feel bad, I didn't do it to hurt her but I know sometimes she is in pain. That was pretty costly too, she is an expensive little thing but hopefully that'll be the last big thing I have to do for her. She is about 6 months but she is still relatively small, I'm hoping she will be a petite kitty and not get too big. The world's biggest cat weighed 87 pounds, I can't believe that some girls at school probably weigh around that size. I just think that's incredible. Wow, my hands are starting to hurt from typing, good thing this is almost over, and done. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Damn, I should have smoked a cigarette before I started writing. Now I have to wait for twenty minutes. It's cold in here, I thought that I turned the AC off. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be writing. When I have to think about typing it's hard to figure out what else I'm thinking about. Today's September 11th isn't it?  I wonder if anything is going on. I wish I didn't have to work on Saturday. I want to go tubing with Brandon and his family. That sounds like so much fun. I hate having to work and go to school. It's so pointless, driving an hour each way, just to work for a few hours. It makes no sense, and neither does them cutting my hours because they're over on manager hours when I've only worked one day so far this week and they're wasting all there manager hours having Danielle and Craig come in at four in the morning to work on truck. That's fourteen manager hours that they're throwing away off hours when we always have to have a manager there when the store is open and just because Craig wants to be off by noon because Sunday is the only day that Craig gets to see his boyfriend, never mind that they live together. And never mind the fact that my boyfriend, all my friends and family live in another city. Never mind. Days of Our Lives is on in the next room. I think that this storyline has been going on for about a year and a half. My arm is falling asleep. It's amazing how they can drag a single conversation out for an entire week on these shows. I've decided to boycott the news. All they do is perpetuate a society of fear. The only stories that make it to the news have to involve murder, terror or death. They don't even need reasons anymore. all they have to do is say we are in orange. you must be afraid. be very afraid. Cut to commercial. consume. consume consume. That movie Bowling For Columbine captured the whole American fear thing so perfectly. How ironic that Michael Moore criticizes the United State's part in foreign wars, Bush's policies and all that crap throughout the movie. he wins two Emmy's for it and criticizes this stupid war in his acceptance speech, and is ridiculed for it. You can say whatever you want to in a documentary, we'll even award you for it, but don't you dare say anything bad about this war or our incompetent president when you're wearing a tuxedo. Now my toes are falling asleep, too. I probably shouldn't sit like this. I hope I can catch the bus on time in the morning, and I hope it's still free for students. Now my toes are tingling. Damn, I still have four minutes to go. I wonder what the next assignment is going to be. I'm not sure how accurately someone can actually write in stream of consciousness from their own perspective. When you write, no matter how fast, you choose what you put on the paper and you are limited in what you are thinking about to what you are writing. The best stream of consciousness stuff that I have read has been highly ordered and well thought out by a writer who is writing the thoughts of a fictional character. Like in Sound and the Fury. I can't remember who wrote that. I don't think that it was Fitzgerald. Oh, cool, my time is up. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Today was a very hard day at school. After my first class, M408D, I read my Economics book for what seemed like forever. My friend Chris can be a bit pushy sometimes and it makes me pissed off. He is one of those, Everything has to my my way"" guys and he cannot conform to anyone's wishes but his own. I took Spanish for three years in high school and I like to speak in that language sometimes for fun. He got mad at me and my other friend for talking in ""Spanglish"" because he does not like it. He gave us a ultimatum and I got ticked. Man to day was rough. Seinfield is on. That is a good show. Kramer is the best character because he physical comedy is on par with Jim Carrey's. The timer says 3 minutes 20 seconds and even this feels like forever. I have a lot of chores to do. Put up our sheep, clean the pool. My mom is going to kill me if I do not get those done. I guess I can tell her a was busy typing a psychology paper but that will never fly. I need to get something to drink but I cannot get up for another 15 minutes. Oh well. I need to change my calendar. The stupid thing is still in August. The candle in my hallway has a strong odor as I can smell it clearly all the way down in my room. Cool. They are playing The Rock on USA. I think I'll watch this as I type. It should keep me halfway amused instead of bored. I got a Economics quiz tomorrow and I am not looking forward to that. My professor is great though. A very funny man, he has a way of putting micro-economics into a state relative to us college students. His examples, while off-the-wall, are pertinent and really do have a good meaning. He even sold us this bag of 3 Musketeers he had. He must have made at least $5 off a bag that I could get at Wal-Mart for about $2. I did not get one. but if I had a quarter on me at the time I would have. I need to turn on my light as I can only see my keyboard's keys from the light my monitor is putting off. It is too dreary outside and my window is proving useless right now. I needs to rain. They say it will here soon in the next two or three days but you can never trust that. Those weather guys try there hardest and use computer models to ""predict"" the forecast but when you get down to it, they are really just making educated guesses. But a weatherman does seem like a cool job. You can basically lie to people every night and get away with it by saying ""Well we try to predict the weather the best we can but Mother Nature does what she wants sometimes. ""  Alright, I only have 8 minutes left to write. My the time goes by fast when you are actually thinking about stuff to write. My computer is getting old and I need a replacement. I have pop-ups bad. Somehow, somewhere, I got a file on my hard drive that contacts pop-up servers and brings them to my machine. In doing this, it wins because firewalls are useless against programs that contact other servers from inside your machine. Basically a firewall prevents incoming signals from a machine that you did not originally contact first. User-initiated contact goes through unmolested. So by masking it self as a program, the file is able to bypass the firewall by making contact with the pop-up servers. I only have 5 minutes left to write now. That is good. Man, this is a sweet part of The Rock. This is the scene in which Nicholas Cage is in a yellow Ferarri and is chasing Sean Connery, who is in a black Hummer. This scene has a lot of good action. I like action movies. I guess as I guy I find them more appealing than drama or suspense movies. My belief is that in order to make a good movie, a director has to have lots of guns, explosions, and really hot girls. Without these elements, the movie will not appeal to guys my age. I still need to get my Economics book. I got the main one but the second one is still at the Co-Op. My luck they will run out of it by the time I remember to go by and pick it up. My dog needs to stop scratching. And my other dog needs to stop bothering my oldest dog while he is scratching. I would find that annoying. Man I could really use that drink now. Good thing I have less than a minute left to type. In the words of Homer Simpson. ""WooHoo!""  This has been fun. I actually wish I could've had more time because there are more interesting things going on in my mind but oh well. Hope this is a good paper. Oh, it says if I want I can still keep on typing. In that case I think I will. Where did my remote go?. HAHA. got ya. you thought I was going to type more didn't ya?  Well ok I am done now. I can finally un-mute my TV and go get that Coke. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm really tired of studying. I hope this doesn't take long. Man I want some water. Will this thing know if I leave? I sure wish Ashley would call. I miss her so much. Or maybe I want Sherri to call. Or Missy. Or Shawne. Who do I want to call? Too many girls, this school is going to get me into trouble. I hope I get all my homework done tonight. So I can have a social life this weekend. It would be nice to relax for once. Not have to carry a book everywhere. I felt so stupid reading at the football game at halftime. But we have so much work. I'm just not used to this. I'll get it done, I have to. I need to get a 4. 0 this year. So I can get into that damn business school. Why does it have to be so hard? I see stupid people all the time who are business majors. I'm smart, why can't they let me in? Jesus, its only been five and half minutes? This is going to take forever. Lets see what other h. w I have. Summary of the readings, due tomorrow. Catch up on chapters in Art History. Take a nap. yea right. I wish I knew what sleep was. And I have to go see Missy tonight. Hopefully that is a cool symbol. I wonder who is going to read this? I'm sorry your having to read this. We must be very boring people. I hope you get what your looking for. I sure wish I was in your position, then I wouldn't have to sturdy so damn much for this class. I don't understand DR. Pennebaker at all. I enjoy listening, but as I write, I fail to comprehend. And as I comprehend, I fail to write it down. Which is more important? And the text book. Ohh My God. The most interesting part, was the story about the black guy getting shot by the cops on page 1. At least it had a little drama. Like on TV. Damn I wonder what is on TV right now. 6:30. I don't have a clue. Not used to the channels down here yet. And ohhh wait, I wouldn't have time to watch TV anyway, with all the work. Damn, I'm thirsty. I wonder where David is. I almost killed him for setting off that alarm on his truck in the middle of the night. Well not really, but I was upset. I need my sleep. I don't have time to be jumping out of bed, to see why there are blaring horns. I need to learn how to spell. I'm retarded. I need sleep. Damn A Nap Sounds Good. 5 more minutes until Nap time. yea right. 5 more minutes until I read some more. Why has no one called me. I know Sherri won't call. God forbid you call your ex boyfriend back. What we can't be friends? I miss her so much too. Ashley is perfect. but sherri was perfect for me. No one treated me better then her. Too bad she is 4 hours away. but worth the drive. At least its not 5 states like Ashley. Won't be seeing her any time soon. I want to go see her so bad though. I know she needs me to be there for her. She is so fragile right now. Sherri will be ok. But I really need her to be there for me. Or maybe I just need someone to be there. I can't stand this being alone. Girls only want one thing here. to not have a boyfriend. Just have fun, 24-7. I miss having a real girlfriend. Sherri made me so happy. I want that so bad. Ashley can't be that for me unless I move. I got to figure this shit out. damn did I write all this. I have issues. whooaaa hoooaaaa. I wonder if there are any parties this weekend. I wish I could go. But Ill probably just hear about them next week. Ohh well, Back to studying. Bye Bye reader. Until Next Time I love that symbol. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I like doing these sorts of assignments. My english teacher last year insisted that we do a stream of consciousness writing at least once every six weeks. It's not only easy, but interesting to do as well, especially when reading back on what I've written. I'm in the dorm now. It's cold. My toes especially are cold. they seem to get cold pretty easily. I'm watching the Simpsons as I do this paper. The TV show is awesome. I play the saxophone in band and my section last year in high school based ourselves around the Simpsons. I was Bart and the director that played Saxophone was Homer, and other people were other characters as well. Fun times. I'm not looking forward to tomorrow because I have class that starts at 8:30 (music theory) and I'm going to have to sing for the class which I'm not looking forward to at all. I only have a decent tone in my voice for about an octave and then my pitch starts to go down the gutter. I'm a music studies major and I'm actually looking forward to my private lesson tomorrow with my professor as well as the saxophone choir class. My professor is known as one of the best, if not the best saxophone player in the nation. It's neat to learn things from him, but at the same time it's also sort of nerve-wrecking for me. I'm really full. I just got back from dinner; two chili dogs, french fries, a cookie, and coke. Good old healthy dinner (sarcasm). I actually do try to watch what I eat here at school since I don't have my mom around to force feed me vegetables and fruits. I'm thinking about getting another coke from the 'fridge right now. The Simpsons is really distracting me because I want to watch it because it's so funny. but I know I need to be doing this. Typically I would turn off the TV to do homework but before I began this I sorta figured the tv would help give me something to talk about. Is that cheating? thinks about it Nah, shouldn't be. I'm here from Austin and it's nice to know my way around. All these new students that don't even know how to get around the campus yet. and just think they have not even begun to explore how great Austin is. I was thinking about showing around some friends since I have Friday night open. I was going to ask this one girl on a date but turned out she had a boyfriend already. Luckily I found that out before I had gone and asked her out. But yeah, since I have Friday open now I figured I should go ahead and at least show my roommate around. He didn't bring his car this semester though so I don't know how much he had benefit from seeing all of Austin. I can't help but look at the clock and think GO FASTER!"". My roommates computer just started making a very high pitch noise and it's really really really bothering me. My ears are pretty sensitive and this sound is actually painful. He needs to hit is computer to make it stop. I did it once when he was not here (hah). Oh well, it should stop eventually. I'm still feeling really full. I should probably go work out around 9pm. I worked out yesterday for the first time in a long time and my legs are really killing me. I concentrated on my legs more then my arms/chest. I wish I had worked out more over the summer. I worked out a lot over my senior year but when summer came I worked a lot and when I didn't work I was out boating. My allergies are really bothering me. It gets so cold in here that they start to act up. Every morning I wake up and have to sneeze because I'm so cold. I also hate getting out of a hot shower and stepping onto a cold floor and into cold hair, it makes me want to stay in the shower all day. My roommate is worrying over astronomy, haha. I passed out of math and science for the rest of my life through AP tests and SATII's. I actually wouldn't need this class because I already have Economics credit which is a social science but I need Psych. for my education certificate or whatever it is. (I plan on becoming a band director). I'll probably be here for five years. I don't think anyone has ever graduated in 4 years that was a music studies major, even if they took summer school. I plan on taking some summer school at ACC, but not much. I'd like another cookie, although I'm full. Only three more minutes to go, this actually hasn't been all bad, and hasn't seemed that long. I thought about chatting with friends on the internet at the same time while doing this but I decided that wouldn't be very efficient, plus this would have been much shorter. I hope this is long enough. Which it should be. My roommates friend from HS just came over. They're from Eagle Pass, Texas. which is down on the border between Laredo and Del Rio. I'm interested in going down there just to see what it's like. My roommate says that Austin is much better than Eagle Pass will ever be, which I wouldnt be too surprised of, but I don't know. I can't wait for the weekend to get here so I can go hunting some more. Dove season opened up on monday. I got 4. it was a very slow day because it was lightly raining so birds weren't flying much. But getting four put me ahead of the rest of the people I went with. I was just alerted that 20 min is up, so I'm stopping. "
Tell me about yourself.,"this is really boring, I'm so tired, I think I might take a nap after this but I have to write my social work notes. I wonder what will is doing in his class right now, I think this exercise will show that I think about him too much. I wonder if stacey is in class. did angel get the message I sent to her cell phone? should I go home this weekend? if I go home, I think I'll want to stay there, but if I don't go home I'll miss seeing my lil brother and I know he really wants to see me, its a good thing I haven't told him I'm thinking about it yet. I really want to get me and will tickets to the football game and to the austin city limits music fest. I wonder if by getting him tickets I'm encouraging him to ditch class. I don't want to encourage him to do that, I want him to do well more than anything because I know that he wants out of UTSA so bad. I hope that he stops hanging out with that arthur kid so much, that kid is trouble. he isn't going anywhere. will has so much potential to go so many places, and arthur is just going to drag him down. omg its only been three minutes. this is crazy, I type fast and there is going to be so much stuff here. I wonder if my hands will hurt at the end of this. I guess it is keeping me awake. I'm so tired, I just want to sleep once in awhile. I actually did sleep last night, I only woke up once I think. its so hard to sleep, I don't know why. its probably because of this horrible dorm, with its horrible smells, horrible neighbors, and the massive amounts of noise associated with traffic outside. I was so tired that I took a freakin nap at russ and will's apt. awwww. russ is so awesome, I think he might be one of the best people I know. I wish more guys were like russ. I wish will would start being more like russ and a lot less like arthur. arthur is so dull. who in their right mind only thinks about parties, drinking, and easy girls? he is so one dimensional, and will is so much more than that. I wish he could make more friends that actually have substance. I wish I could make more friends too. oh, I made a friend today in sociology. I let her borrow my notes since she said she wasn't in class. slept through or something. that sucks. I hope I don't do that, but since I have no friends here, its not really a possibility right now. man, I feel like such a pathetic loser here. I have friends, I really do, I keep telling myself this. but I don't think anyone here believes me. I walk around all alone all day, and only talk to people when I have to. its such a pathetic existence. then I come back, study, run errands or work out, eat, and sleep. I talk to my friends online a lot, and on the phone a lot. I wish they were here. I hope that russ and will are here next year, and that nicki, stacey, maris, kayla, tracy, and everyone ends up here. maybe plunkett will too, that would be fun. I wonder how he is. I hope he is ok. he doesn't talk to me too much. I think he probably does miss having everyone around. I wonder if marc is ok. I think underneath his happy front he is the saddest person I know. weird. he is a great person though, good heart, good intentions, doesn't always follow through though. man, I wish I was back in january. january was the start of an awesome semester of high school. I think I was actually popular in high school, which is weird to think about. I was never like the prom queen or anything, but I had about a ton of friends, and I knew they were all loyal. they were so great, they still are great. I miss hanging out with my guys. they were so much fun this summer. craziness. and my girls, I want to go dancing with them. there are so many clubs here, and it would be so much fun if we all went. but for some reason, its not as much fun going with ppl I don't really know that well, and don't care to hang out with. like christyn soland. ha, I was actually glad that she went to san antonio with me this weekend. I felt kinda bad for ditching the YL ppl, but I think it would have been awkward for them with me around, esp since they think so horribly of me. I don't want to be around ppl that hate me anyways, or are fake friends to my face. I don't know, I tend to bash her a lot, and esp will does too. we hate her mutually, ha. damn, we should just go out or something. I can't believe his mom thought we were. I can't believe everyone thought we were. that is so strange, I wonder what he thought about it, but he didn't seem to care at all when stacey told him. he kinda just stared at us with an apathetic look on his face. I wonder where that frame I made him went. he seemed to really think it was cool. I'm so glad we got to go to lunch and hang out. I really want him to be here with me next year, but more than that I want him to get out of UTSA and be somewhere he really wants to be, whether that be here or not. I wonder if he wore that burnt orange polo to the game last week. I hope we get to go to a game together, that would be so much fun. we have fun together I think. I can't believe that I miss everyone so much, and I can't believe that I care about him so much, as a person, as a friend. its scary. its like the whole robby thing. robby. I wonder how he is. I can't believe he had a girlfriend. I wonder if he still does. he was such a great guy, he still is I'm sure. he thinks he has to define himself now by drugs or smoking or horrible music. I'm not understanding that. I wonder if wonkie is doing the same thing? I can't believe she would smoke. I bet she couldn't believe I would drink. why does armando think I would give it up to will. I may like the guy, but that doesn't mean I want to jump in a bed with him. I hope he was just kidding. I wonder why robby went off the deep end and pushed everyone away. I hope that doesn't happen to will, I hope he doesn't push me away. if he pushes me away, he has arthur left, and russ, but he will push russ too I'm sure if he pushes me. I hope that arthur falls off a cliff and breaks both his legs and arms, and has to leave UTSA so that he doesn't ruin will. I hope that he doesn't kill him. it made me almost cry when russ was kidding about that. it makes me so worried when he says he doesn't mind getting into a car with drunk arthur. I know he knows its wrong. does he think trying to validate it to me will make it ok? what would I do if he died and I was the last one to talk to him, and I knew he got in a car with a drunk arthur? I would feel guilty. but there's nothing I could do about it. I couldn't stop him. there's no way. he is making decisions on his own now. well I don't think he is doing a very good job of it. why does he tell ppl that he got high or drunk and decided to go to utsa? I know he remembers that it was me saying he should go for it. I convinced him to go there, like he convinced me to go here, and now we're both not happy. I think I handle it better. I don't know that running away to san antonio to see him/everyone is better, but at least I'm not screwing things up by being drunk all the time and fo "
Tell me about yourself.,"Hmmm. lets see well nothing is really going on. I have to go to the doctor tomorrow at 10:15 because I have a sinus infection. a few things about it though are kind of fishy. I have to see a sports medicine doctor, not a real doctor. Also, the guy on the phone was a little weird. I am also scared that  by tomorrow I will be well again and won't need to go to the doctor. I have been sick for three weeks and am tired of being sick so I guess I should go. I kind of miss my room at home. It is hard to have to share a room with someone. This is the first time I have never had a room all to myself. Sometimes I wish the room was just mine but I am ok with it because I know it is good to have a room mate. Christine is nice, she is just a little whiney sometimes and always breaks things. I really need to work out but I cannot because of this sinus infection that I have. When I run, or even walk, my face hurts a lot from the sinus fluids in it. How that works, I don't know. I was thinking about it. How can sinus fluid hurt your face. I could ask the doctor, but I am too lazy to listen to the answer so I won't. Hmmm. whatever is on my mind. I really have a lot of studying to do. It is 10:00 in the morning and I woke up just to study. Getting this done though makes me feel as if I have gotten something accomplished. I like that feeling of accomplishment. Everytime you do something you get a check. Chapter 1: Check, Chapter 2: Check. The check feels really good. I don't know why it feels so good but it does. I am kind of concerned right now about the time. This clock on the computer is really off but I am using it anyway. I just have to time 20 minutes right? I have ten minutes left. I have rally never known how to spell the word minute. I don't even know if that is right. For all I know that could be the for minute(as in small) I even spelled it one time minuet, but latter found to my embarrassment, that unless I was talking about music, it wasn't. So for now I just always right minutes. as the abbreviation, in order to spare myself the pain and embarrassment of spelling it wrong, even though I just spelled embarrassment wrong and still don't know which spelling I typed it wrong. I am actually a good speller, I promise. I just get confused sometimes. This it boring for me so it must be boring for whoever is reading it. I guess I will type about something interesting. Hmmmm lets see. I really want Matheus(sp) to do that recording test on me. The one where is records every five minutes. (See there that word is ageing) I really would like to know what is going on in my life. So far this is what I think is going on but I am not really sure. I am sick and am going to the doctor tomorrow. I need to get a bike because my classes are too far away. I am mad a some of my friends for getting football tickets without me: I stood in line for an hour last week by myself to get them for them. I don't have a football ticket. I think I might go to Fort Worth instead for the weekend because my grandpa is sick. He is not really sick, just a little depressed because he is getting old. I thought I might cheer him up. It makes my grandma up set so I though she could use some cheering up too. And this is why I need to take the Recording test. Because I hope, if not already think there is something more going on in my life that I do not realize. It has been 20 minutes- good bye. "
Tell me about yourself.,"what am I supposed to write about?  I can't type right. I wonder what I'm going to do tomorrow. I need to wash my clothes and do all my homework. Those Rugby Little Sisters are strange girls and they have weird parties. Where's Ashley? My roommate is talking to me. She says I need to keep some of my thoughts to myself. I guess maybe that's true. I don't want to do homework. I just want to go to the football game this weekend and not have to worry about grades. I hope that freaky guy isn't going to be at the party on Saturday. He might try something on me again. I like this song, it makes me think of going to Houston. I don't like my Biology 211 professor, she doesn't teach very well and I don't know how I'm supposed to pass her damn class if she keeps jumping around the book and not lecturing about what she needs to lecture about. She is too disorganized. I really need to wash my clothes and I need to workout tomorrow. My foot hurts, though. I really don't feel like running 10 miles tomorrow. That sucks. I wonder what Brendan's doing. Probably drinking. I can't wait to go home next month. It's funny, I'm not homesick, but I'm excited to go home. I want to go to Europe. I kind of want to go to Spain. I want to go everywhere. Wow, it's thundering a lot. I hope it doesn't rain on Saturday. I don't really feel like going to the rugby game tomorrow. I really need to study SOMETIME this weekend. sometime other than sunday. I'm so sleepy. I'm sleeping in tomorrow since I don't have class. I'm thirsty. I need to go buy more Diet Dr. Pepper. There just aren't enough hours in a day. I'm mad at John. He still hasn't called me and he didn't even say goodbye to me. I thought he was more of a friend than that. Apparently not. Yuck. I need to wash my face and brush my teeth. I feel icky. That girl is STILL on the phone. And she probably wonders why she feels so homesick. Well, maybe if she had get off the phone she would actually have a life here. Being on the phone isn't going to help her at all. She is kind of bitchy too. She is just not friendly at all. Whatever. I hope Aryan's doing okay. Maybe I should call him. It's too late at home, though. Never mind. I have no idea what I want. I just can't let all my exes go. Maybe it's because I'm too immature or something. That's why I needed to get out of Knoxville, so I could decide what I want with life. Here comes Ashley. Okay. I'm sick of the bathrooms here. I want my own bathroom. I hate it. The water here kind of smells funky too. I guess I'm used to more chlorinated water. I need to call Joe and Stefanie. I hope they get married. Rebecca's wedding is on Saturday. Wow. She is only 21. I can't imagine being married in two years. That's way too soon. My hair color is awful. I want to go back to that salon and get that bastard to fix it. I mean, I spent a lot of money on crap. I should have told him right off that I hate it. I should be more confrontational. I have that issue. I need to fill up my water filter. I really want something to drink. Good. Only like five more minutes of this. My right shoulder has been hurting lately. It feels as if my vein or artery or whatever is going to burst. I need to get my meningitis vaccination. There's so much to do and I just don't have time to do it. That tickled. Oh! Virgo! That's me. What am I going to do next week for my birthday?  Who is Beau?  Uh oh. "
Tell me about yourself.,"it might be a good idea to join a coed frat for engineers because then maybe I will get some studying done and actually get help on my calculus from someone who knows more than I do. a bagel sounds good right now since I haven't eaten lunch yet, but not will jelly, I think I will have philly cheese instead. this place is a mess, if my roommates leave anymore of their curlers and hairdryers on the floor when I get home, I think I will have a cow. that's okay, they are great roommates, they always do the dishes and for the more part are considerate of my belongings. here on out I am going to eat healthier and exercise a bite more than I have been lately. I hope by me playing more racquetball lately will not effect my previous tennis skills. rob will die if I do get better because he hates to loss. that would be so funny if I could kick his butt in racquetball, but then he would be pretty upset. although I think I can relate to his family more than I can to him. his head is in the clouds will all of that philosophy he reads. I can't understand why someone would pick a worthless major like philosophy when all you can do is write a book or teach. why not do something with your life which you can apply and gain new knowledge from. besides I think everyone should have to take philosophy, because there are basic ideas everyone should just know, but not to major in. my roommates are home, I have to close my door. they are so loud, I think I suppose to cook tonight, looks like I need to go to the grocery. I think chicken, pasta, and some kind of bread, oh yeah, and a salad of some sort will be good tonight. I need to make sure they eat something later so lessen the affects alcohol will have on their bodies. I am so sick of drunk people anyways. all of those girls that came by last night, were all drunk by the end of that crappy box wine. anyways, it is gorgeous outside, I hope to find time to swim in the pool I haven't yet been in, I feel like I live in a resort living here, we have everything. I have a great life. I live two of the most wonderful people, I have a family who completely supports me and a boyfriend and school and everything. the little things in life for the most part I enjoy and I having freedom, enough to make any grateful person happy. and even if I don't have all these things, there is plenty to be grateful for. too many good things, great food, great wine and genuine love. although these enjoyments wouldn't be the same with the not so enjoyable things. I love life, no destination, just a journey and one that you can turn in any direction you want. life is what you want it to be. but I don't want to get caught up in idealistic idea, but should keep my feet on the. my roommate came in, no thank you. what was I thinking, oh yes. keep my feet on the ground by also being realistic, and many think that being realistic is the same idea as being pessimistic, I differ. maybe those are the people who are actually "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, I'm sitting here writing this. Not much is going on right now. I was playing free cell on my computer before. Yeah, I was that bored. Wow, this is what college is like. My roommate is sleeping right now. That's all she ever really does. Sleep and eat. speaking of eating I'm kinda hungry even though I had boba tea and a spring roll like at about 11. I really need to stop these late night temptations! yeah I really don't want to gain the freshman 15 as they call it. I want to go home this weekend but I really shouldn't. I have a lot of crap to study for. I want to go home to see my grandma and my dog. I'm not using very good grammar or punctuation in this assignment. I hope whoever reads it does not think I'm a complete moron I'm just lazy! yeah my laziness often gets in the way of things oh well. that is life. now I'm not thinking about anything much. I wonder if we are going to have one of those random pop quizzes in bio tomorrow. I hope not. I didn't do much today partially because I went to eckards to buy myself some cold medicine and orange juice!  I believe in my vitamins. hhahaha ok no!  that was retarded. I think I'm getting sick. ARRGH  I hate getting sick because it always lasts for a while and now I can't miss classes. damn college. I don't know how people who miss class do it. I would always be scared that there would be some sort of pop quiz or the professor going over some random things that will be on a test. like I say GRR to college. I kinda miss high school now that I'm not there. I hate the way time just moves on and there is absolutely nothing you can do about it. I was thinking about that today and there isn't much time till I'm 20! only like 2 years. I never imagined myself even being 18. I guess I don't realize how much I have really changed. Not many people realize whenever they change kinda like you don't really realize whenever u change physically. Grr sorry. I accidentally pressed the finish key but I was not finished since there were like 6 minutes still left so I'm going to continue blabbing for 6 minutes. its only fair. I really do wonder what the hell my life is going to be like in 10 years. It seems that then everything is going to change. Coming out of high school whenever I think about it not much has changed. well the people that I see have changed and my surrounding has changed a bit but I still talk to my best friends. My room mate has been my friend since middle school. I hope that living together won't interfere with our friendship since everyone has those horror stories where they shared a dorm room with their best friend and then they become enemies. I don't think that will happen to us. at least I really hope not. I really do hope that I will soon get over him. this is kinda random but I think about him a lot. I don't even know what is so great about him. nothing really. I guess I still like the person he used to be. USED TO BE is the key word. oh well. I will get over him. Anyways. my continued 6 minutes are about to be up. I hope my blabering was not too stupid and mindless. Oh well! bye bye    "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now I am sitting in my dorm room thinking about how much reading I have to finish tonight. I am listening to the radio as I write this. Jessica Simpson is what I am listening to. I am also thinking about how many typing errors I make as I type. I am drinking Pink Lemonade and chewing Orbit gum. I am also thinking about my boyfriend, and waiting for either an email or a phone call from Kuwait. I am very worried about him, but he reassures me everyday that he will be ok. I have to read a lot of Biology tonight. I also have to get my clothes together for tomorrow morning. Tomorrow is the start of my first full week as a college student. I don't like college to much, it is quite boring and time consuming. I would prefer to be going to college closer to home or at home, but here is where I find myself. Oh well, it's okay. I'm testing the waters and seeing how I like this place. So far so good, the football games are fun and my classes are interesting. Except for one of my Biology classes, my professor is evil. I wish that my boyfriend would call, I would really like to talk to him. I miss him so much, and I can't wait till he comes home. I have lots of pictures of my family and boyfriend in my room. They are all over, I miss them all so much. I hate being this far from them, but I have to do what I have to do. I am full from eating a giant burrito at Freebirds about an hour ago. I keep staring at my cell phone hoping someone will call me. I still have to do some Pre Calculus homework and read for Psychology too. I received one Instant Message, I wonder who it was from. Probably my little cousin who bothers me all the time. Everytime someone signs on and off the internet that annoying door sound plays. It gets on my nerves. I wish it was Saturday still, I had fun on Saturday. I am tired of typing and I want to start my reading so I can go to bed. My roommate is going to Jack n the Box, and she asked if I wanted anything, but I do not like burgers or greasy food anymore. Plus I am watching my figure and do not want to get the dreaded Freshman 15!"" I just got an email but I can't read it until this is over I want to read it so bad because it might be from my boyfriend. Dang I so wish that I could check my email, with my luck it probably was my boyfriend. My music stopped and no it is silent in my room but I can hear some music from my RA's room. I think her roommate is playing the music. It sounds funny from here but oh well. I'm really tired from staying up so late of Friday night, but I guess that's what I get. This gum is already starting to lose flavor and I just barely put it in my mouth. Yuck! Blah! I got new sunglasses this weekend. I like them a lot. I got to shop some this weekend, and I bought more food for my room. I didn't need any of it, but it was definitely a spur of the moment type thing. I really need to read my Biology so I can read my Psychology so that I can take a shower and go to bed. It's only been 13 minutes since I began typing and I feel like I have been typing forever. I am worried about my Biology class and I hope I do good. I don't want to let anyone back home down. I want to be able to prove my ex friend wrong that I can be on my own, since she was to chicken to leave home. But I don't like her anyways, she has an obsession with thinking my world revolves around her, when obviously hers revolves around me. I don't know if that made sense, but I don't really care. Only five more minutes left and I am running out of things to write about. I got another email and now I am pretty sure it is my boyfriend. This is the longest 5 minutes of my life. I also have never made this many mistakes when I type. Oh well. I want to run downstairs and get myself some snacks. I wish I could go get some right now but I have to finish writing. I realize that I can't wait to get something over with and then when I start it I don't really feel like finishing it. Oh well, only a little bit more time left. Then I can cross this off my to-do list for the week. I miss my boyfriend so much, I cannot wait till he comes home. I get to go home next month! YAY! I can't wait to see my family and my puppy! I am thinking about all the times I had when I was at home. I had a sense of security there, I am very family oriented and I miss them a lot. Only 30 seconds left. And then I have more to do tonight. I have so much to do in so little time. Time to get it all done so I'm not swamped this week. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I thought I was supposed to set a timer. So I set one, and now I don't think I need it. its actually getting on my nerves. Am I supposed to use correct grammar? I'm not using it at all. I'm typing like I do when I talk to my friends online. I like this song on delilah. I love delilah. why don't others? She seems to always make me in a better mood. Or is it because I like depressing music. I love depressing music and often times wander if it just makes things worse. Actually, I think it does, but sometimes u just have to cry and let things out. I think I cry a lot, but I'm not always depressed. I use to be depressed for a long time when one of my good friends totally ripped my heart out. adam is such a good guy. Do I really like him though? Or am I just wanting a guy to talk to and call my partner?  He treats me so well. Was jennifer thinking about me and adam when she talked to my dad tonight?  oh well, I'm out of high school so it shouldn't matter anymore. But it bothers me when people don't like me. I miss my best friend lauren. That song today really brought back memories. I love college! I'm pretty much caught up on my work and when I finish this, I'll be even closer to being caught up. There is A LOT of reading u have to do in college. Wow. I hope I don't get counted off for my bad grammar mistakes. I'm just so use to typing like this!  that's not good. I don't like this song right now I wish she would play some good songs! man my back is starting to hurt. oh well I have bout 13 minutes left of this. this really isn't bad at all. In fact, I think it's kind of interesting. What time is adam going to call? I wander if he is almost done with all his homework. I love my parents. I'm glad I talked to them tonight. I feel so refreshed and organized. college is awesome. I love all the people that are here. Many people thought I wouldn't like all the people, but I actually do!  I'm a big people person I guess. I don't know what else to think about. when is my roommate coming back in?  I probably should've went and watched that movie on clark field. Oh well. At least I read a chapter of psychology today. I have two more chapters to go and ill be caught up. I thought he was going to tell us when to read! I found out he didn't, and now I'm trying to catch up. I can't wait for my birthday. tomorrow is midnight rodeo! what am I going to wear? I have no idea. maybe I can borrow something from sarah. Do I dress up or not really?  I wander if oscar is going to come or if daniel is. How much is it to get in?  Well I have plenty of money after returning my book the other day. I'm so glad I got seventy dollars back today. what am I going to do with it?  I guess save it until I really need it. I think we need a lil more food in our room. I just don't feel like going to the store. Lauren had her car taken away, so we're probably going to have to find someone to take us!  Ok maybe delilah is about to play a good song. This is awesome! I can type without looking at the keyboard! I've always wanted to be able to do this, and my friend was so good at it. I wander how I am going to be creative with my lonestar application. I really really want to make the organization. If I don't I'll be so sad. oh my gosh! I love this song. sure I'll think about you now and then. haha. I was singing. we can do that right? Because I was really singing it in my head. oh man. now I'm starting to feel stupid. Oh well. I wander what other people wrote about. hmm. I wander if I'm doing this right?  ok I'm tired of sitting up straight. I'm so full. I think I need to stop eating so much! But I really do want to gain wait. why is it no one believes me when I say I don't like being so skinny? Skinny people always get teased. I want to weigh at least 115, and since I have come to college I weigh 2 pounds more. 107. ok my time is almost up. YAYYYY now all I have left to do is read and finish my application. Oh man. I have to get my shot tomorrow! "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am sitting here on the hardest chair known to man. Even with a seat cushion its still not comfortable. My roommate is talking to her boyfriend on the phone. They talk forever. They never discuss anything interesting either. Speaking of boyfriends, I miss my boyfriend. I am going to be really busy this week and I am worried that I won't be spending enough time with him. I have an application to fill out for a girls' group called the Texas Lonestars. It sounds fun but I am worried that maybe its not quite me. ""  The girls are really obsessed with each other and I never get along that well with girls. Girls usually hate me. I think because they're jealous and also because I am pretty intimidating. Meagan White probably hates me the most. I wish she would get over herself. God she is a bitch. It makes me insecure when Matt's ex-girlfriends are always still calling him, IMing him, and text messaging him. I trust him but its hard not to be bothered by it. I hope we stay together for a long time. I love him a lot. Geez its freezing cold in here. I think I get abnormally cold. I can't handle temperatures that are less than 73 degrees. Kelly and Chance are talking about getting married. but not to each other. I wonder if they will marry each other? I bet they will. what a boring couple they are. I think I'm too harsh on Kelly. I always judge her but then again she judges other people all the time. She is very racist. She hates our asian suitemate because she smells. But it is true. she always stinks up the bathroom. This is the easiest assignment I have ever done but it does kinda suck because its time consuming. I am tired and tired of school. I wonder if I should stay in business. I don't think its totally ""me. ""  But then again I don't even know what is ""me. ""  I only know what I'm good at. I don't really know what I even like. I think I think too much about the future. I always over-analyze things too. I can't help it. I'm a perfectionist. at least I want to be perfect. It seems the harder I try the less perfect I become. Does that even make sense? My back hurts. I'm trying to sit up straight so I have good posture and so I don't have to feel my fat rolls on my stomach touching. I wish I was skinnier. but I can't say I'm totally unhappy with my size. I wish my hips weren't as wide and my tummy was a little flatter. Yeah. dropping 5 pounds would be really nice. My face is starting to break out again. If there's anything that has been a huge pain in my life its my skin. It affects so much of my life and attitude. I thought the birth control was helping. maybe its just stress. Yes, I am very stressed. I have not had time to breathe since school started. And I know its only going to get busier. Sometimes I wish I could just escape. freeze time and come back without it costing me anything. My fingers hurt. And I'm still cold. I'm slumped over now, I give up on the posture and fat rolls. I feel guilty that my family misses me so much and I don't miss them. I really don't. Not even my sister Emily. which is a surprise. I thought I would at least miss her. but I don't. I should call them tomorrow. Maybe my mom could help me with my lonestars application. I have so much stuff to do. I'm scared. Why am I so touchy feely emotional lately? I used to never think of myself as emotional, but I think ever since I started dating matt I have become much more emotion oriented. I think I have become more insecure too. That does not really make sense though. But its like now I have to please him too. One more person to impress. before it was just myself and kinda my parents. but mostly my competition. I'm very competitive. I think of everyone as my competition. I bet that is unhealthy. but then again. what is healthy? I can't think of a single person I know that is ""healthy"" or has ""healthy relationships. "" I am almost done now. I'm just waiting for the clock to wind down so I cna start on yet another homework assignment. oh joy! I wonder why matt has not called me back. I need him to lift my spirits and to talk to. He is really wonderful. is that normal that I'm so obsessed with him? "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am so cold right now, and I want to take a really long nap. I have so many things to do and I don't know where to start. I miss my family and my boyfriend a whole lot. I don't know if I like the whole idea of growing up. Sometimes I wish I could be a kid forever. My roommate can sometimes become annoying and I just want to scream. My suitemates are cool though, although one of them smells kinda funny. I really want to go shopping this weekend and already can't wait for a break from school. The cafeteria food here is not that great. the enchiladas are fattening and spicy but the ice cream is good. I had the best ice cream the other day at Coldstone Creamery. It was cake batter flavor. Crazy ,huh?  I am trying to be accepted into different organizations right now as a freshman and still balance my schoolwork. I am now happy to be in the school of education. So many people have put me down and discouraged me for wanting to be a teacher and then a principal. But I am glad that I have stood by my own convictions and passions to become what I truly would love to be. I think I need to take a shower. I want to have a family when I am older and I can't wait to get married and have kids. Someone in this room needs to buy a mop because our floor is getting really gross. Our shower is very small in the first place and combined with being dirty, well that's just plain bad. I've met some really nice girls in some of my classes and I hope to build some very good friendships here in college. I tend to get stressed out easily and am very anxious about tests and other important things. I play with my hair a lot and as a result I need to get my hair trimmed. People think it is ridiculous but I have done it since I was a child. I had a conflict with my sister this weekend. I hate to say this but sometimes she can be a very uncaring person. She is the only family member that lives close and she doesn't act like she wants me to be a part of her life. I think she is just self-centered and almost jealous of my involvement"" in college which she did not take advantage off. It's not my fault that she lived off campus for her first year. I hope that they have a computer for me and don't run out at the computer store on Friday. I really need one and hate relying on someone else's. I wish I was able to pay for it but right now I am unable to work and a thousand dollars is usually not in a college student's budget. My mom is the greatest mom there ever was. She would do anything for me. anything. I wish that her and my dad were closer though. When I was little we would always go on family adventures and now we seem to be more distant. I really hope that I can plan a trip to go on for Spring Break with my boyfriend. I have never really gone on a trip all by myself before. I wonder if my friend martin from Germany is going to email me back. I haven't heard from him in awhile but I think sometimes he behaves in ways that I would not tolerate. I wish my razor didn't hurt my skin. I guess I need to buy a new blade. My little sister is painting her wall with a mural of New York city. she has this wild idea of becoming a dancer when she grows up but I don't know about that. My mom is helping her look at dance colleges right now but I think she should be a little more realistic. I really want to go home right now and eat a home cooked meal and take a shower where I can actually move around. I really need a hug and a kiss from my boyfriend. I am not used to being so far away from him and sometimes I worry that we are going to become distant and that our relationship isn't going to work out. I really could see us getting married but I guess I should leave that to God, if you know what I mean. I love pizza an ice cream. I wish they weren't so fattening. I need to go kickbox this week. It's not the same here as it is at 24 hour fitness. It's cool though. good exercise. I'm really tired of typing. I got to go tan outside today. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Stream of consciousness, I can't even spell it right, in any case I'm sitting here its 10:50 in the morning and I do not feel like doing all this crap today. too many classes when I'd rather just sit here doing nothing whatever its stupid anyway I feel like sleeping or some nonsense. nose itched. anyway I wonder what I'm going to do tonight about all that homework good god its exhausting I should taken less hours or at least not calculus that class it kicking me in the butt, I don't know anything. tangents. velocity. who freaking cares I'm no physicist, but for some reason to be an economist I need to know how to calculate velocity of a ball and decide what dosage to give patients based on tangent and secant line. honestly I don't care  I just want to get out there and keep going. chris is probably at school right now, I wonder what he is doing. oh he is in government, he better be bringing that C up to a B right now on that test. if he just tried he could be so much smarter but I distracted him and made him get the c to begin with, but its still his fault. damn nose. whatever. I just want him to do well on this one. I like it when he is smart but I don't always because I begin to feel inferior. in any case, I love him no matter how he is I just wish he had help himself more. he is working tonight, so we can do something this weekend, I paid like 50 bucks last weekend because he had no money,  its not like I'm rich. I work for my money I took out loans. my dad has not had a job since he got out in 8 months. I'm not rich. he starts his job on october 1 so that is really good because my family will be a lot better off. its quite exciting for us since we've had such little money for a while now. I'm not going to get stuck up because of it either. I wish someone would send me some mail  I check that stupid box everyday and I don't get anything why can't someone just send something to be nice  beth got a box and I still have not gotten anything. just a fucking postcard or something would be nice. oh well. ill mail someone something first then they'll have to write back, or not. I like my penguin picture, he is waving but he looks sad. I'm sorry penguin. thirsty. yuck. that cherry coke is disgusting, it tastes like carbonated water. gross and I paid 85 cents for that shit. what is up with my face itching while I?m writing this stuff. ooo. I'd rather be playing my game right now, although I really should be working out ill never be ready for thr PFT like this. can't do all those pushups and I don't know how fast I run. ill run till I vomit I guess. nose ITCHES AGAIN. I love chris he is such a nice boyfriend. not like those other guys who didn't really treat me right. chris is not perfect but he has changed a lot since the beginning of our relationship and madison and all the shit that caused. in any case, we are happy now and madison can kiss my ass. he asked me to marry him in a sense that we aren't engaged but we will marry each other, we're moving in pretty soon together,  I wish he had stop being such a mama's boy and tell her to get over it. I'll probably be the one that convinces her to pay for it and be happy about it. saves a lot of money and chris and I can be together. we fight and stuff but its never big stuff. my parents will be fine with it. my dad will take a while to get used to it but my mom will support me if I really want it. it saves like 300 a month by doing it this way. MY NOSE!. 15 minutes. u got to be kidding me   this should be over by now. he should make it 15 minutes for next semester's class. actually 25. I want them to work more than I did. lalalalalalallalalalalalalalalalallllllllllaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. your my best friend. oooooooooo  youre more than a lover there could never be another to make me feel the way you do. oooooooooo  we just get closer fall in love all over. what a good song love that tim mcgraw his wife is cute too such a cute couple. jamie just got online. that girl does not know how to have fun whatever. choochoochoo. my brain feels pretty blank. I'm all thoughted out, I got class in 52 minutes and I don't feel to good from that stuff. in 3 days I take AFOQT, and then go home and see my family and chris  fun times, ill work too make some money for this week and buy that cute Aeropostale sweater. so cute 40% off too hope I don't miss that sale, I don't have a car to go buy it now or else I would, I can't wait to get my truck in like a month when my dad starts his job  a blue f-150 so pretty "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am so tired. This headache is really getting to  me. I wonder if I can make it through the classes today. Why is my foot numb. Sleeping on the floor last night really hurt. I wish the little boy did not cry so much. I hope I will have enough money to go to Brazil for Christmas. I really miss him. It is so hard that his parents don't like me. I know they don't, even if he says they do. Wow my headache is going away. I think I am  hungry. I won't eat until 11:30, that way I can make it through my classes. I am dreading the first one. Social work is so boring. Why did I get myself in it. Man my stomach cannot wait to eat. ouch. I need to clean my sheets. I need to read first though. I wish I had a more comfortable chair in here. I need to save my money. I hope I have enough to last the year. This sucks struggling to have enough money. I should not cross my legs it is bad for the blood flow. I need to stand up straight too. Slouching is not going to help what I already did from sleeping on a floor with no pillow. Man I have so much to read. All I want to do is sleep. I cannot sleep though I have to read, run, work, go home this weekend. I am dreading that. All I want to do is sleep and I have to get up so early just to go to church. I wish Granny would just let me sleep in once. At least they do not sing in the Mass. I keep messing up in my writing. ahhh! This is driving me crazy. I need to correct all my mistakes too. I hate mistakes. I hate messes. I hate the fact that this computer is a piece if junk and I cannot afford to buy a better one. I am lucky in life though. I admit that. I should be happy with what I have. There is not use telling myself this,  it only makes it worse. It just makes me think of everything that is wrong. I wish I could disappear for a little bit. I wish I could go back to Brazil right now to be with Rica. He makes me so happy. He makes me realize how great I am. He shows me how much he cares. I am so happy he is my boyfriend. I just wish he did not have to go back. What do his parents expect. I cannot  speak Portuguese. How was I supposed to talk to them. They cannot know what kind of person I am. I tried to stay out of the way. I did not know what to do. I think they are not telling him the whole truth. Of course they  would not tell him that they do not like me. Plus he is moving here later for me and he is their baby. They would have to deal with Carlos again. There I go crossing my  legs. This room is freezing. I only like it like that at night. I wish I did not worry so much. It makes my head hurt. I wish I did not have to worry for  just one day. Everything is going wrong this year. I do not want to call Dad. He will just talk about bills and the divorce. He will  sigh 500 times. He will make excuses then talk about work and ask why I never see him. I hope he does not talk about when he went to church for the first time in 25 years. I do not even like that church. They only make fun of my religion. I need to learn to be more nice about it. I just don't what that weird place converting my Kylie. I worry about her. I worry about Kalan. What is going to happen to them. Quit crossing your legs. I wish my nails were long. They are so thin. I need to go to the store for food. I need to save my money. I can deal with the food the dorm gives me. I will just drink water in my room. My car stinks inside. I hate when I get out and I smell like smoke. I should check the oil. I will do that today after I run. I cannot believe I went from 12:50 to 19:40. I was doing so well running before. I did not change anything. I hurts now to run. I cannot breathe. I do not want to go to the doctor. I just need to get used to the air. Although I have been back home for a month now and the air was not much different in Brazil. I hope the shot of pain that goes through my  heart goes away. I just imagine an artery clog. I am so young and I eat healthy. I bet it is stress, or I am not breathing correctly. This itch on my nose needs to go away. Quit crossing your legs. Type faster so I can keep up with my mind. This is kind of hard because I think of what I type. There goes  my nose again. At least I stopped crossing my legs. Yay, I am almost done. I am hungry too, but I have to  wait 12 more minutes. I should have had something little this morning. I  hope I don't get fat. I am already fat as it is. I need to get rid of this stuff. It is so hard. IT will not go away. It is just that one area. I will get surgery when I am rich. h ahah that is a good way of looking at it. Like it will ever happen. I do not even know what I want to do with my life. Why do I worry about all this stuff constantly? "
Tell me about yourself.,"I really don't feel like sitting here and typing for twenty minutes, but what ever. I'm kinda tired. All I want to do is go take a nap.

Tell me about yourself.,"What is Ale doing right now? She looks pretty funny ironing on a table. Wow! I have a lot of homework and I don't even get some of it. I need to get a tutor for like every subject. It's Monday, shit! I still need 4 more days till the weekend. I wonder if Rodrigo is going to call me for the weekend. I hope this weekend is way better than last weekend. Eww! It smells like burnt clothes hahaha. I don't want to go to class right now. I still need to wash my clothes. Where am I going to get change? I don't want to walk anywhere. I need to call my mom for some more money. Oh! my dad too. Oh God I just signed up for a Friday night experiment! I hope it doesn't interfere with my Friday night. Oh wow! I got fat over a couple of months. That's it I'm on a diet. Damn, it's only been Five minutes. Hmmmmm, can I even put foul language on this assignment? Will he even read this. God! I hate eminem reminds me of the ugly winters in Laredo. I don't miss Laredo. Whoa! Ale looks like a maid ironing! hahaha. Why hasn't Rodrigo called me? I wonder if he still loves me. Should he trust me and I trust him? God, 7 minutes barely. I wonder if he is going to check for spelling or punctuation. Ummm. I'm pretty hungry, but I'm on a diet. Where is Anne? She is never here. I need to go exercise after I go to class and after I wash my clothes. I smell starch. I need some water. I think I'm getting dehydrated. I need to buy that necklace that I liked in BeBe. It'll look great with my new outfit. I need to get a guy. I'm tired of being a tag a long. I want a nice latin guy with money. I have to admit that does attract me. In fact, it'll attract any girl. Oooh I like this song, is there any more room for me, in those jeans""! Ale thinks I'm bad, but I'm not I just like to express myself. I like myself, I would date me. Why doesn't anyone want me or Ale? I guess, we are not girlfriend material. How can you get to be ""girlfriend material"". Okay. I am spilling too much information for my professor. Will he think I'm weird! I am weird sometimes. My book just fell! My phone is ringing and I can't pick it up. Awww. The newspaper just fell. Ale is making a mess and she can't iron for shit. I should stop saying bad words. It doesn't look nice on a lady like me. Ale's making me hot with the iron. I wonder if she will iron my clothes. Oh Wow! I have about a min. actually. Wow! this song is so ghetto, but I can feel my head bouncing. "
Tell me about yourself.,"It is 12:51 and I would really like to go to sleep right now. I think I would feel better if I could just take my eyes out of my head. It's cold in here. My finger itches and I don't know why. It won't stop and its affecting my writing. I hope I used the right form of ?affect? in that last sentence. I hope I don't have any spelling errors either. I have so many things to study and I'm trying to figure out when I can do it all. There's a really cool show on the TV that's on about mummies. It's very interesting. I think I missed Tom and Jerry on the Cartoon Network today. My finger stopped itching. Now my arm itches (and I'm not making this up just to copy the example in class), it really does itch. I need to pay some bills later. I just want to go to sleep right now. I hope I will go to sleep tonight because I couldn't last night. My arm stopped itching. I don't know what else to write and I've still got 10 minutes left. Boy, this is taking a long time. Now the TV is on some stupid show and I would change it but I have to keep typing. I think I'll take a nap after this so I don't fall asleep in class. That Philly Cheesesteak I had for lunch was really good. I'll need to drink so more water before I go back out in the heat or I'll collapse. This humidity kills me. Walking around campus is very good exercise though. I need to remember to take my calculator to math Friday. Well, that's almost 5 more minutes. I mean, it's not a bad writing assignment, its just feels so monotonous. I had to pop my fingers a second. I probably should call my cousin who lives in Austin, but I really don't want her to be over here all the time least she find out where I live. That reminds me, I need to go switch my meal card later and check my voice mail. 2 minutes to go. I hope you don't think I'm crazy by reading this but you probably do so, oh well. 1 more minute. 1 more minute ten I can take a nap. Almost there. 15 seconds. THE END "
Tell me about yourself.,"Okay, well,  I am watching the movie XXX""  I'm not really watching it because I'm typing, but I'm listening to it. I really can't type that well, so there are probably going to be a few misspelled words. My sister made me mad a while ago because I asked her to call me when her husband got home and she didn't. I looked outside because they live next door to me and his truck was there. I was like ""Okay, why hasn't she called me?""  Oh well, whatever. Oh, I don't know what to do. My friend hooked me up with her friend Carlos. He is really nice, but I feel bad being with him because I'm still in love with my ex boyfriend Jorge. Well, my friend Melissa told me that Carlos already loves me. That's not cool because we've only been together for like 3 days. I love Jorge so much!  I don't know. Man, I just heard somebody. I hope it wasn't my mom. She is always bothering me. We really don't get along. I came home and my room was a little rearranged. I know that my mom was in my room. She was probably looking through my things. That's not even cool because I had a letter by my bed that had some very personal things written in there. I'm pretty damn sure that my mom read it. She is always going through my things. I think that I probably should've lived on campus or maybe got an apartment. She is always yelling at me like if I'm a little kid. I need to get a cell phone because she is always getting mad because people are calling me. She gets mad when she doesn't recognize their name. She comes and asks me ""Who's so and so?""  She also gets mad because my friends call me late. They call me at like 2 or 3 on the morning. I tell them they can call me late though. Anyway, I need a cellular. Ah, I don't know what to do with Carlos. He wants to buy me a cell phone, a ring and send a dozen of roses to my house. I know that's sweet, but I don't like for guys to buy me things, especially not expensive stuff, but I do need a cell phone. I don't know. I miss Jorge. We were supposed to get married. He told me that he loved me and would never leave me or break up with me, but he did. He had our life planned out. He knew what kind of cars we were going to have, how many kids we were going to have and what our house was going to look like. I hate it, because I don't even know why we broke up. He gave me all of these excuses, but I knew they weren't true. I later found out, like a whole year later, that two stupid girls broke us up because they were jealous that we were together. They probably liked him and wanted him for themselves. That's another thing that bothers me. If it was because of a good reason, then I would understand, but they made him believe that I cheated on him. I loved him so much and would never have done that to him. I don't understand why he believed them anyway. If he had any doubts, he should've asked me if it was true instead of just believing them. "
Tell me about yourself.,I hope that this 20 minutes goes by fast because I hate typing and Big Brother 4 is on in the living room and I can hear it but I can't see it. My leg itches and now so does my shoulder. It's funny how when you think about something itching then lots of parts of your body start to itch. I have an economics quiz tomorrow that I still have to study for. Maybe I will ask Kristina to get me ready for it. It's my first one in college so I don't know what to expect. So 20 minutes is a long time because I am out of things to say and it has only been 3 minutes. My lips are kind of chapped but I don't feel like getting up to get the chapstick form the bathroom. My head itches a lot today. I think it must be from the weather. Now my arm hurts my holding it up to type since The Towers does not give us a place to put our keyboards so they have to sit up high on the desk. I have such bad posture when I type. I slouch over a lot which makes my upper back sore. I don't know if I can go for 20 minutes without going through some intense pain. It has been almost 48 hours since I have talked to my mom. She must think that I have been abducted. I will call her after this long assignment. I wish someone would call me because I am so bored and it is the first night that I have stayed home alone. But I have had a lot of homework so it is good that I have been home to get it done. I need to give myself a pedicure when I go home this weekend. my toenails are getting really long. I think I will go to the high school football game on Friday if my brother goes but I am sure he will since the love of his life is on the dance team. My teeth feel really grungy. I guess I didn't brush them after I got back from dinner. But man was dinner good. I love beef chalupas but I love them more when my mom makes them and puts guacamole on them. I emailed a lot of people yesterday and I wonder if they have emailed me back. Probably not since everyone is busy with the start of school but oh well. Man it is really cold in here. If I turn up the air then it just gets too hot and I would rather be too cold than too hot. Except for in the mornings when I step out into the hall to go to class. it is freezing out there and then it is really warm in the elevators. This place has really bad temperature control. I have not gotten any mail so far. it would be nice to know that people still love me and miss me. They are about to announce the veto on BB4 so I am listening in to see what Allison is doing. She is giving a whole life story up there and she used the veto on herself which is smart. Anyways I still have 6 minutes left. This has goe by pretty fast but now my wrists are hurting a little. Maybe I am developing carpultunel (sp?) syndrome. That can't be good. I miss my dogs a lot. They were so cute when I went home this weekend. I miss sleeping with Pita. my bed is so lonely without her. Maybe I should get a guy to replace her. That sounds like a good idea. I can't wait until the new and last season of Friends starts in late September. I am going to cry at the season finale. My roommate just said how happy she is that she didn't take this class because this assignment although not mentally hard is quite physically hard. Only 2. 5 minutes left. Oh happy day. I wonder if any of my friends are online so that I can talk to them when I am done with this. My bracelets are starting to dig into my wrist since I am putting pressure on them to type. I need to get some more stuff to decorate my room. It looks so plain compared to my friends' room but their room has too much stuff in it. My time is almost up now. I only have thirty seconds left. Man that really did go by now that I think about it. I hope we don't have any more assignments like this one. My hands hurt!   
Tell me about yourself.,"So I have twenty minutes to write about what I think. I was thinking of all the things I thought I would write earlier, but suddenly I'm drawing a blank. I think I'm going to stop trying to write properly because there's really no point. after all, I'm supposed to write what I'm thinking, and if I get to caught up in punctuation I don't think my thoughts will flow as naturally as they would if I was not' typing at all. nick lachey is pretty swoll, and a pretty good singer. jessica simpson can look hot, but at times she looks rather plain. there are a lot of plain looking girls here, somewhat of a disappointment. isn't college suppose to have a lot of hot girls?  o well, I have a girlfriend, so it really shouldn't matter. I remember hearing that the average male thinks about sex every 7 seconds or something like that, and it looks like I'm get to that subject pretty soon. I like timberland. he consistently makes good beats. but magoo fell off on the last single I heard from them. what's the name of that single?  I think its one and all. I turned off the music because I don't think as randomly as usually do when its on. Its like I focus on the music and that is all exists. maybe that is y I could be a good dj if I tried, but I never practice, and that's why omar's upset wit me. I hope he is doing alright now. he says he is, but I know he is still tripping, at least every now and then. man, I told him not to trip on emmi, but what he don't know is that I trip on her too. that is pretty fucked up, but I can't help it. as erin said, that girl's seductive. and she really is seductive. I wonder why. she is not THAT hot, and I see a lot of flaws when I look at her, but I still want to get with that. maybe its just lust. now that I think of it, it is mostly lust. but I would never mistreat her. well, I don't think I would mistreat her. I thought I would never cheat on my girlfriend, but look what I did in cancun. I can really trust my boys--everytime I got a dirty secret, they shut they mouth. its' not cool that I have such a big mouth. I been saying I need to work on it, and I think I'm finally getting there. now that I'm controlling this part of my personality, maybe I can control my hormones as well. but I'm 18, and everyone says they know what I mean when I tell them wussup. felix agreed with me, even hazel. life savers kickers are pretty damn good. I'm tripping, thinking bout emmi again. I don't know why I'm so infatuated wit her. but its not that strong of an infatuation. not like it was wit crystal. when I saw her at the omega talent show, I still thought she was fly. and I say she is a stuck up bitch, but I know if she honestly wanted to date I wouldn't think twice. I wish I was like those cats that know how to pull any girl. I'm starting to realize its a game, and pulling a girl is as simple as making her think you have what she wants and needs in life. I need to stop thinking bout other girls. I have a gf. just like I need to stop chatting on AIM because all it does is keep my from doing my work. I'm getting sleepy. the fire alarm went off again. I wonder if anyone actually watches the monitors that are hooked up to the cameras in the halls. well, I guess they do seeing what happened to dennis the other day. I'm getting sleepy. I wonder if I meet jaymee ong if I'd actually have the nerves to approach her. probably not, unless I was famous like her. and even then, I don't know if I would. probably if I was drunk I'd do it. hahah. I wonder if I'll have the nerves to go up to carol from alpha sigma rho. there I got thinking bout other girls again. and here I go getting sleepy. every time I take my eyes off the monitor I get sleepy        my fingers are starting to get a bit tired. this is the first assignment I've had that requires me to think about what to think about. man, chatting online never makes me sleepy, but its the exact same thing I'm doing now. sa was right. it is all in my head. if I could control every aspect of my behavior, that would work to my advantage. no more fallen asleep wen I have to read for class, or falling asleep on the road. maybe it just requires discipline not to procrastinate. but it would be cool to control the mind and have telekinesis and ESP. I think semi just sent me a text message, but I only got a minute left, so I'll wait till I'm done with this before I see what she said. I want to sing. if I could sing, I would rule the world hahaha. maybe not, but I'd feel like king. right now, that is wut I want most in life "
Tell me about yourself.,"Wow, the person next door has their music up too loud, but now they turned it down. I can't wait until the party tonight. I'm not normally excited about parties, my foot hurts, I moved it. Well, I'm at 50 sec. Hmm. there comes the music again. I don't like that kind of music otherwise it wouldn't bother me. What does Katie's computer say?  She was playing solitaire. My wrist itched and I scratched it. Is that how you spell scratched?  It doesn't look right. It's funny how simple words often don't seem like they're spelled right. Words like of. I could think of where the o key was, there I did it again. Two minutes and 31 sec. The green light on my router box is flashing. I guess, it's supposed to, though I would think a solid light would mean it was working right. I want to know who actually reads this kind of thing, or if it is read. It might be interesting, I suppose. I bet people write some pretty crazy stuff. I almost wrote shit there, but then realized that might be inappropriate, which is funny since I just made a comment that people might write crazy things in these types of papers. Particularly if they're crazy. I make my self laugh inside sometimes. Oh goodness, I'm making jokes with myself and my stream of consciousness paper. I had to look at the top of the stream to remember how to spell consciousness. 5 minutes and 16 sec. Wow, this is going by pretty quickly. The scroll bar just started. My headphones are sitting next to my computer. I'd like to be listening to some music right now, but of course, not my neighbor's music. Maybe John Mayer or Counting Crows, or Dave Matthews Band or I could get my new Rascal Flatts cd from my car. I really like every song on that cd. My dad called today. We haven't talked since I've been back here in Austin. I remember last year we talked about every other night for a while. I guess we are both just more adjusted to being apart. I'm very close to my dad. Wow, I'm writing as if I'm talking to someone now, which I'm not. I should stop that. Hmmm. deep breath in and out. Jordan. I wish he was on-line, I'd really like him to come to the party tonight. It should be fun. Phred will be there though, and he did say he might go to Houston with me tomorrow. That's nice of him, but I guess, maybe he owes me because I did take him home at 2 in the morning last night (this morning). Wow, someone could find out all the crazy shit, there I said it, about someone's life by reading these writings. Writing, I haven't written in my journals in a long time. I have been writing some in the on-line diary though. so yeah. Alec doesn't read it though. This is hard to not edit my thoughts. Every now and then, I think about something and then skip to something else, then realize I should be writing everything that comes into my head down. So, I am making a conscious effort not to edit, I had to look at the title of the page again to see how to spell that. I'm typically I good speller. Maybe it's the pressure of this writing assignment. 11min and 20 sec. Man, this semester, all my professors have really great websites for their classes. I'm so impressed. I wish I was good at creating web pages. Then I'd make one for myself, moved my feet situation again, and again, I'd let everyone know about my webpage and situating myself, I'd, scratched my eyebrow, I'd update my webpage every day. Scratch my ear. I don't know why I'm itching all the sudden, couldn't find the c key. Well, looked at Katie's computer again. She has so many more people on her buddy list then I do. I have people on my buddy list that I don't even talk to when they're on-line. well, a number of the people on her buddy list on people from the John Mayer message boards, I wanted to call them bulletin boards, but that's not what they're called. Anyway, scratching. tapping my foot. seeing that word tapping doesn't look like it's spelled correctly. Oh well. I guess this really isn't for a grade, so it doesn't matter if I spell things correctly and do our minds spell . correctly. I don't know. I'd like to be a part of the ta's studies with the tape recorder catching small glimpses into my conversations throughout the day (though I don't have fabulous conversations) or the study about people's relationships and why people stay together and why they don't. I mean, someone should do a study on Alec and I,  I wouldn't necessarily call us dysfunctional, but I surely could be wrong in staying around for him for so long because yeah, he could treat me better, or pay me, scratching, more attention, scratching. I'm getting really uncomfortable, my neck and left arm is starting to cramp up, I haven't had to type this much in a long time. I guess, because I haven't had to write any kind of paper in quite some time. Well only less than 2 minutes left. This has been fun. I'm really uncomfortable. I'd like to read some other people's writings from our class. I am curious what you can tell about a person from something like this. Is is even accurate, because couldn't someone just create some elaborate/or un-elaborate story to put down here, or poetry or something. Hopefully, it doesn't sound like that's what I'm doing because I'm not. Now, I sound paranoid, oh goodness. well, nearly done. 7, 6, 5, 3, 2         "
Tell me about yourself.,"I really like the song that was on MTV just now. Simple Plan is a cool band. I wonder what my friends are doing later for supper. I don't feel like going to class at 6. I just want to sleep. I wish my boyfriend and I would stop getting into arguments. It really sucks when we fight, I hate it!  I'm kind of hungry. Where is my roommate?  It seems like she is never here. Oh well, more private time for me. I miss my mom. I have so much to read for my classes. Chapters and chapters and chapters!  Looks like I have my work cut out for me for a long time. My Spanish class seems really easy, I hope it gets harder, so I feel more challenged. I wonder when I should go talk to an advisor about my major. Should I change it, not change it, minor, or double major. why is everything so difficult?  All questions and decisions in life should be yes/no or multiple choice!  That would be so wonderful. Celebrities are so gorgeous, they suck. Although, they are pretty cool people. I guess, I don't really know them. I have an itch on my leg. I hope I don't get sick, that would be horrible. I can't wait for the game on Saturday. It's going to be so much fun. Rap music gets on my nerves. I need to finish taking pictures on my camera so I can get them film developed. Why is so cold in here. I turn the air warmer, and it gets too hot, then I turn it cooler, and it gets too cold!  That sound is annoying, I wonder if the AC is supposed to make that noise. This room needs to be vacuumed. It's gross. My mom sent me a letter. Yay!  I'm excited, but I can't open it until I'm done writing this assignment!  I need to turn my closet light off. I'm thirsty. I feel like drinking a Dr. Pepper. That sounds so yummy!  I think I might eat a pickle when I'm done too. That sounds like a plan. I'm almost done with this thing. Mom uses ugly stamps. Oh well, I have cute ones. "
Tell me about yourself.,"It's 6:48. I think I'll type up the time as a reference even though there is a timer at the top. As I sit here, looking around and typing without looking at the keyboard, I wonder what my girlfriend is doing since I am using her computer. Can't wait till Monday!  I finally get my own internet set up at my apartment. I feel like I'm getting sick. I was sneezing a lot the other day, now I have a slight sore throat. I wonder what the purpose of this assignment is. Is someone actually going to read this or is it just busy-work?  Gah!  I hate this runny nose!  My girlfriend sure has a lot of pictures of me. a little too many?  Hope she is getting a good work-out at the gym right now. I need to find more time to go to the gym now. Going to the gym everyday for a few minutes isn't that good, right?  Wow. I feel like my ex-roommate. All he ever did was study, go to the gym, and hang out with his girlfriend, too. I wonder what I'll do for dinner tonight. I should eat healthier. Learning how to actually cook a decent meal might help. I hope I'm doing this assignment correctly. Oh well, if I'm not, I can just ask a TA just to make sure. It's only been 6 min and 15 sec?  Wow, this is going to be longer than I thought. Oh look, it's Bloat (a toy from McDonalds that was in the movie Finding Nemo). What a great movie that was. Best children's movie I've seen in a long time. I'm feeling more ill now. This can't be good. Maybe I shouldn't go out tonight. Ugh, that's right- I won't be sleeping over tonight either because she cancelled on me so that her friend can sleep over. Oh well, I've been spending a lot of time with her recently; it's understandable. I need to find some tissues. There's a roll of paper towels and toilet paper. I think I'll grab some toilet paper. Hahaha- it's just like in elementary when we ran out of tissue boxes; the teacher would sometimes have a roll of toilet paper. *sigh*  I miss those good old simple days. A lot less pressure and life was so relaxing back then. It was good to be young. I know what I'd like to do right now!  I want to play counter-strike!  Too bad I can't install it onto her computer. I wonder if whoever is going to read this knows who she"" is. Should be obvious, so no worries. What homework/reading assignments do I need to take care of this weekend. Hmm, I'm taking care of this psychology writing assignment right now, I still need to do that one experiment (which is being a pain since it keeps running into that error page and I can't go any further!), LEB, FIN?, maybe a little CMS reading?  I think that should take care of it. Oh wait- got to do the ECO self-homework tomorrow. Look, she is back!  Aw, she is tired from working out. What?!  She just told me how ""everyone"" has commented on my latest pictures on her board!  Apparently, people think it's a good picture of me. I guess it is. I actually like those pictures of me (which is kind of rare). I wonder if I can type like I do when I'm online- GRAMMATICALLY INCORRECT!  That would speed up my typing. Look!  I'm at 19 minutes now!  19 is a great number. All done now! "
Tell me about yourself.,"I love this song so much. well, actually I love the band. Our Lady Peace, where did they come up with this name? It doesn't matter but it's just a question. I can't help but think back to freshman year of high school and remember the times that these songs remind me of. those were good times. ahh, well times change and new things come along. geeze, I'm so hungry. I can't wait to go eat with mom and dad. They are so great. I can't believe how much money they've spent on me and sam for college so far. wow, that's a lot and I'm so lucky. this next song is so good. I love this whole cd. music is such a great thing to have. it expresses feelings that you can relate to and it is a great way to relax. school is so different. I don't know what to study and there is so much reading. I feel so overwhelmed. oh, the football is is tomorrow. I'm so excited about it. they better win. and the red sox I hope will keep on winning. I want them so badly to go to the playoffs, even if they are the wildcard. they deserve it. isn't it funny how you come to like something? for example, how I became to like the redsox. I know I came to like them because of michael. it's funny how you like something or show interest in something that the person your dating likes. I couldn't help but like them because he did and it gave us something to talk about and be interested in. I like the redsox now and it came from him. he is such a great person. I can't believe we've been together for this long. almost 3 years is such a long time, but it has been great. he is sweet, funny, kind, nice, beautiful and he makes me feel good. He is my best friend. I can't wait to go get my pedicure today with Andrea. It will be good to see her and spend time with her, she is such a sweet girl and is always willing to talk to me. it's weird not seeing all my friends from high school. I miss them so much. I can't Anna had a baby! She is such a great mom and everything, but she is missing out on so much not being able to go to UT or Saint Mary's like she wanted to. I'm glad she is determined to still take classes at ACC though. She is making the best out of her situation and I'm so proud of her. And Ella, her baby. What a beautiful baby! I love her so much. I can't wait until she can play and talk. I want to play with her and just be able to have fun with her. I want to spoil her even though she isn't my baby. I'm getting so tired just sitting down. I want to do something, maybe, vacuum the room. It's getting kind of dirty. I want to eat! I miss my animals. I want them to live with me here in the dorm. I love petting them and giving them attention. I'm glad I went home yesterday. Even though I go home at least once a week, I miss being there. I miss my brother, parents, and the animals. Andy is so funny. He has no one to play with or antagonize. He tries to wrestle with mom and she can tell that he misses us. This is the best song on this cd. It is so pretty. "
Tell me about yourself.,"This is a hard assignment in the sense that I do not know what I am thinking. I have so much homework to do today. I really wish that I had more time to do everything I need to do before a new week starts. I cannot believe that it is already September. I am so ready for another three day weekend. I wish we had another break before Thanksgiving holiday. It is such a pretty day outside. I really should have exercised. I wonder if I will have time tomorrow. Oh well. I really need to go grocery shopping. I have nothing to eat in the apartment. I should ask Kristen if she wants to go to the store with me. Something else I need to do is call Grace about my trip to visit her this October. I really hope that the trip works out. I miss her. She is the funniest girl ever. I really want Mexican food for dinner, but I am having Italian. Oh well, Italian could also be good. At least I won't eat a thousand chips before I even get my meal. Instead I will eat about a pound of bread. Does that even make sense? A pound of bread? Oh I guess I mean a loaf of bread. Whatever. It is so quiet in this room right now. I wish there was something going on so that I could have something funny to think and therefore type about. This stream a consciousness essay must be really boring for someone to read. Actually I bet some of them are really interesting to read. I always am wondering what other people are thinking about. I wish that I was a better typer. I am a little faster than I use to be, but I still make a ton of mistakes. This essay could get pretty long considering the amount of thoughts I have in a twenty minute period. Oh I guess that I am not the only person home right now. I heard a door close it must be Kristen or Catherine. I love living in an apartment. It is so different that last year. I never made my bed. I should get in the habit of making my bed when I get out of bed each day. But then I know I would want to take a nap that day, and then I would just mess up the covers again. Beds are meant to be unmade. I guess that is how I feel now, but wait until I have a family of my own. I totally will be just like my mom and make my kids make their bed every day. I wish that I was as organized as my mom. She always has everything in the right place. I guess I will grow into being more organized one of theses days. I guess? Wow the time really has gone faster than I expected for this essay. but now that I noticed the time I bet it goes even slower. I hate the feeling when you are in class and you think it is at least half over and it really has only been about 15 minutes. That happened to me in math Friday. I think because it was my last class on Friday, I was just anxious for the weekend. I love the weekends. I wish I could have gotten more sleep this weekend. I feel like I never get enough sleep. I in the the mood just to curl up in bed and watch a good movie. I wonder what movie? I really am in the mood for a really good movie that I have not seen or that I love. I have not been to the movie theater in so long. I think the last movie that I saw was Pirates of the Caribbean. It was good. Jonny Depp looked really crazy in the movie. Orlando Bloom is so cute. I wonder how old he is. I bet he is in his early twenties. Just the perfect age for me. I like the idea of the guy being a little older than the girl just because of maturity. I really wish that I had a crush on someone right now. I feel like there is no one I want to date right now. That is the worse feeling. What time is it. It is getting late. The day has gone by so fast. I need to do so many more things today. I should probably start taking my notes for Geography today so that I don't have so much to do tomorrow. I am so sick of taking notes right now though. I really need to stay motivated!  "
Tell me about yourself.,"What a strange assignment. Why did the typing start indented? Twenty minutes seems like a long time and the timer does not make anything go any faster. It's weird that the one thing you look forward to all day turns out to suck. What do wounded ducks look like? Alright, 1% complete with this assignment. Physics is really hard, but I actually understand everything fairly well. I suppose that's a plus. I wish Lindsay would talk to me. I really miss her companionship. I suppose now is where you notice that I am a normal college kid going through the feelings and emotions. I really hate to be normal. I am not somebody who is outrageous to be not normal because that is conforming to another standard. I instead just do what works for me and disregard most everybody else. I really miss Lindsay. I wish I knew what to do to get he back. I think that is the problem, you can't get someone back, you can only hope they come back. I really hope the power doesn't go off in the middle of this assignment (knock on wood). It's been going out recently. Alright, almost 25% complete. Maybe I shouldn't track my progress. Is anybody really going to read this? Is this simply an experiment? Maybe it's a wpm counter like in computer class. Here comes the scary part in the music. I am listening to Firebird Suite. It really is a neat song, but it lacks something, not sure what but something. What if you started this assignment at 4:50 on Friday? That would really be horrible, but it wouldn't be quite as bad as starting it at 4:41. That would actually be ironically funny. Good times. Something is odd. Not sure what, but something seems a bit strange. I want some natural light, I really can't stand these fluorescent lights. These buildings also are disturbing. I didn't live in the country, but I really miss the trees I had around my house. Living amongst these lonely trees is strange. It's like they are put on display as something that used to be. I want to go to a school that is in the trees. I am talking a tree house. In the trees of the Amazon. That would be a sweet experience. The window, right. Haha, of course I open my window and see construction. Great, just great. It's rather depressing. Alright, more than 50% complete. This could really be a dangerous thing if you really tapped into your thoughts. Might find something you don't want to find. Hmm. I hat that feeling of being hungry after you've just ate. Is ate the right word there? I think it might be eaten"", who knows. I feel like I have something to do, but I really don't know what it is. It felt really good to sleep in this morning. I kind of felt lazy, but none-the-less, it felt great. I saw Cedric Benson in his Escalade XLT today. That is a very nice vehicle he has. Almost 75% completed. What a bunch of crazy rambling. It must suck to be the one to read all of these. I suppose you just search for keywords and check their frequentness. Is that a word? Who cares? I know you don't. I am running out of thoughts and my right pinky hurts, perhaps I should learn how to more properly type. I type pretty well I think, I just have this mysterious pain in my pinky. Shadows are the only two dimensional objects. Shadows are cast from three dimensional objects. So is it safe to say that three dimensional objects are shadows of 4 dimensional objects? Can we say that we are shadows of time? There's a predicament. What is time? That's also a predicament. That would be cool if somebody would call me right now. I really don't want to have to get up so early on Saturday (7:00). Oh well, can't do much about it I guess. I wonder how Phoebe is doing? That thought was brought on by a song that I just heard. Time is almost up. Check you on the flip side. Ciao. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now I am really hungry. I would go eat right now but I am going to run with the marathon team tonight. I ran cross country in high school and was pretty good but I did not run during the summer. Lets hope I'm still in shape. Probably not, I'm going to have to start back at the beginning with two or three miles and work my way up again. This stream of consciousness in not fun. My thoughts are coming out too fast for my to type. It's like when I'm writing an english paper. I'll get a great idea in my head then not able to write it down fast enough and I forget it. Good thing you aren't checking spelling and punctuations and stuff life that. I hate typing on the computer, well not typing but talking on the computer. The I'M stuff instant messaging. My roommate keeps asking me questions while I'm doing the writing. She talks on I'M all the time. She spends more time in the room on the computer than I do and that's hard to do. She wakes up in the morning and turns on her computer to see if anybody is online that she can talk to. It's 8 o'clock in the morning does she really think anybody is going to be on. I never liked talking on I'M and I've tried to. I think many of the things I say are sarcastic and it is hard to show that what you are typing has a sarcastic tone. So I pissed of a few people even though I was being sarcastic. And it could be that I am quiet and don't talk that much unless it's about sports or something. I'm weird, I think I'm the only girl in the dorm that likes to watch football and other sports. I have always liked to watch sports. And I pretty much know that I am the only girl that likes to play football on play station 2. I've always liked playing video games. Like right now I have Grand Theft Auto Vice City on my computer. It is a lot of fun. I love playing. I see it as a stress relief for me. When I had a hard day I'll start play the game run from the cops then feel better. I am able to do things in the game that I would never do in real life. I would never be stupid enough to run from the cops in real life and that's why I like to do it in the game because I can and will not get punished for it. The people who go around saying the game should be band because it is violent and gives people bad ideas make me mad. Even though there are people in the game you can tell they are fictional. All the cops look the same, all the pedestrians look the same. You can tell that this is not real life. If you are running from the cops in the game you can drive around and pickup police bribes which lowers your wanted level and less cops chase after you. Now I know that does not happen in real life. There are clear distinctions between the game and real life. I know those distinctions and would not cross them. Some bad apples that were probably high or drunk anyways that ran from the cops and blamed it on the game should not ruin if for other who think the game is fun. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well I decided that I was going to go ahead and get this writing assignment out of my way. Actually, I was just looking for an excuse to put off my reading for my MIS course. I really dread reading that whenever I am finished with this because it is like 30 something pages long and I already have a bad headache. It's pounding as we speak. (or should I say as I type!) Wow, my nose itches a whole bunch. But I guess I would rather it itch than run. Earlier today I was on my way back to the dorms and allergies kicked in really bad. I hope I am not getting sick. That would really suck. I am really excited and nervous all at once about this weekend. I can't wait to see Devin. I haven't seen him in like two weeks and it is probably going to be like a month before I get to see him again. He had his first baseball game today, I wonder how he did. Did he start? Did he hit well? I can't wait to talk to him tonight and get all the details. I'm excited about watching him play on Saturday. Baseball is his true love and I am really happy that he gets to fulfill his dreams by playing in college. However, I hate the idea of having to come home early on Sunday. My reasons for coming home are good, but I just wish I could spend more time in Dallas with him and not have to rush back. I mean, why does the dance team tryouts have to be this weekend of all weekends. Every other weekend that I have been here I have tried hard to find excuses and things to do and have had no luck at all except for staying out late and partying. I honestly wanted something productive to do. But now that I have decided to go out of town, they decide to hold dance team tryouts. And that would be what makes me nervous. I have always seemed to accomplish my goals and dreams, especially in the field of dance. But now I am going to be up against so many good girls and I just don't know what to do about that. I really hate the idea of rejection, but if I don't try then I'd never even know what would have came of it. Jennifer is trying out too and it's going to be horrible living with someone who makes it if she does and I don't. Gosh, I really am nervous. What if they don't like my style or technique. I will be really depressed if I don't make it. I get embarrassed about stupid stuff like this. I wonder why that is. It shouldn't matter what happens, no one should care but me, but somehow I feel ashamed when I don't make things that I go out for. So I just finished balancing my checkbook and I really could use some more money. Sure mom and dad are paying for everything, but it would be nice to go out and do what I want to do when I want to do it and not have to rely on them. Speaking of money, my tuition bill says that I owe $178 and that is so not true. everything was paid and up to date and then I just decided yesterday to add a ballet course. However, the ballet course is only $59,,that is so not equal to $178. I wonder how long I have been writing for. Oh wow, it has already been 10 minutes! How come exercising doesn't seem to go this fast. I feel like when I am running on the treadmill that I have been going for like 15 minutes and it is actually only like 2 minutes or so. That's crazy. I shouldn't have ran the other night. My legs are so sore now and walking up and down these hills many times a day hasn't felt good on these sore muscles. Not to mention, I have had 2 dance classes since then and it is really hard to be limber and flexible when you are this sore. Now my lip itches. This music on television is horrible. I would get up and change the channel but I obviously cannot do that due to this assignment. I am starting to wonder about this course. The lectures are really interesting and class is fun. I have kept up with the readings and understood it for the most part. But when it comes down to it, will I really be able to make good grades on the tests that are compiled of both the readings and the lectures. That sort of makes me nervous. The professor is really good and easy to listen to and understand, but I still seem to think that his tests will not so much be the same way. I have a feeling they will be very insightful and difficult and that stresses me out. I've come from a background of like all A's and I do realize things are going to be much harder now that I am in college, but I am not used to making much lower than an A. I am getting really sick of staring at this screen and my fingers are starting to cramp. My position is not very comfortable and I haven't moved in like 15 minutes. It is nice to have peace and quiet in here for once. My roommate seems to not care or respect me much. She likes to do what she wants to do and how and when she wants to do it. And that is fine and all, but when I am trying to sleep I think it's just a little rude when she comes in at like 5 in the morning and is all slamming doors and turning on lights, talking on the computer and on the phone! It's like, I haven't been sleeping very well as it is being in a new environment and all for the first time for this long of a time, then I finally get to sleep and she comes in and wakes me up. Then it takes me like another 30 minutes to fall back to sleep. Gosh I really hate that, but we have been friends for a long time and what do you say to someone like that? I wonder what my mom and dad are doing. I wish I could find Amanda's keys or at least find out what happened to them. I mean I just find it so awkward that they just disappeared. My dorm room is not that big and I can't seem to find them anywhere. I feel horrible about her having to take $165 out of her own check book to get an extra key made. Everytime I think about it, I start to get the idea that maybe I accidentally threw them away whenever I took at the trash. I'm thinking about sending her a check with part of the money because I feel so bad for her! Gosh this music on TV is horrible! I like one of her songs, but she just sounds horrible in concert. I don't know how much longer of this I can stand. My shoulders are starting to bother me. It doesn't help out that they were sore to begin with. Oh, something's popping up. I'm through!  "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now I am watching tv. I it kinda hard to type with these nails, I don't think I have had to type a large amount since I got them. The commercials on tv are so stupid, especially the ones for women's health. I need to get my nails filled, but I don't think I am going to spend the money on it, there are more important things that I can spend my money on. I would be nice if I had a newer computer, this one gets the job done though. I just don't know how reliable, because my sister had all kinds of stuff on it when it was hers, and as a result it on its third hard drive. Last year at the beginning of the year, my computer crashed. that wasn't too much fun, because I had all those assignments to turn in and no computer. I is amazing how you can take technology like that for granted, and how limited you feel once it isn't there anymore. Everything seems so materialistic, but I must admit that I am just as materialistic as anybody else. Where my keyboard is isn't very comfortable for typing. Got that book for my sister. That is so weird how her teacher died so suddenly right before school starts. mom said that he had a nine year old and a five year old. That must be so hard. It seems weird that now his wife will be the one teaching the class. I guess she has some kind of degree related to psychology as well. Maybe that is how she and her late husband met. Mom's birthday is on Friday. I need to get a card for her, and I need to get a card for Luis. I can't forget that when I go to the store tonight. Hopefully that won't take up too much time, because I have a lot of reading I need to do and write notes over what I read. It is frustrating, because I am always reading and doing homework, yet I constantly seem behind. I guess I have just never taken this many reading classes at once before. That sucks though, because then I will have to take several sciences at once too, and that will be just as hard. It is hard to get that balance, esp. when you are a transfer student and are trying to figure out how everything transfers. I wish I could have gotten an appointment with that advisor at the health science center sooner. you would think that they would have more than one advisor, especially since she will or has been out for at least a month. I hope that someone from Health south will call me back, if not I will call again since I just got an answering machine and had to leave a message. I would really like to start working again, especially because I need more hours. Well technically I have enough to apply for PT school, but most people have worked there for at least a year, if not more. Some of then have been there for three years. Luis and Eli had been there for a year and a half or something like that. Well Eli isn't working there, because he is starting PT school. I wonder how different the rehabilitation hospital is here compared to the one in San Antonio. I don't think waking up at 6:30 to get to work on time will be too much fun, especially now that I am in school, but I guess I just have to wait and see if they even have any open positions. I don't really like not having a job, I like the security of know I have some sort of income, even if it isn't a lot. Of course, I think school would be less stressful without a job, but I know I could handle it if I had one. Okay I am at somewhere around 15 minutes. five minutes to go. well not anymore since I typed that. Man I haven't been typing too fast, I guess that doesn't really matter. hey there is a card commercial. I should put the stuff I need from the store on a post it. I think I have some stuff written somewhere, I usually have random post its with reminders. I know I have one for the stuff I need to get at home this weekend, but I'm not sure about the store. I'll look after I am done with this. Okay what next. I wish I could type as fast what I can think. I forget half of what I am thinking by the time I write down the first thought. One minute left. I wonder what causes me to get headaches practically everyday. Maybe I should go to the doctor sometime. It could be what I eat, maybe I am allergic to something, or just not eating right. Time's up, I guess this is it. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm very tired right now. I know that I have not been getting the amount of sleep that I need. Is this how college is all the time?  Over this past weekend, I realized that I am beginning to get very homesick. I really miss my family, friends, and my dog. I started crying when I was on the phone with my brother earlier today. School is getting stressful, especially with band. I got a letter today saying I needed to work more on my routines. I don't know what to do. I've already put off so much, and gotten behind because of band. I practice and try to keep up with my studies. I think I really need to focus myself a little more. Sometimes I think it is the new freedom that is causing this. I know what I need to do, I just need to get motivated to do them. I also need to learn how to not procrastinate. I've been thinking a lot about Andrew lately, and about the church. I'm still so indecisive about what to do. Sometimes I think that I believe and sometimes I think that I'm really not sure. Now I'm thinking about death. I don't think there is anything I fear more than that, and what's sad is I know that everyone must pass through it. It terrifies me. I would never take my own life. I'm too scared of what's after, and I love my life to much. Even with all of the stress I still find things interesting. I am still proud of the things I have achieved. I have very high goals for myself and I am so excited about the future. There are so many things to look forward too. Why do people get depressed?  I've never been one to be truly unhappy. Even when there are times I said I was depressed"" I never really was. It makes me sad to think that people can get so down about themselves. I was talking to Chris yesterday, and reading his online journal thing. It made me want to cry. I don't see how he thinks he will never find the right person, or be successful in life. He is such a wonderful person, and has so many things going for him. Why don't people see that? Why can't they see that even with all of the bad in the world there is still good?  You know that makes me think. I am so obsessed with my life and what I do and the people I know. I think that everyone is just as worried about their life and their friends and family as I am. We all live in our own world, in our own bubble, our own space. I think that this assignment is pretty cool. I actually do this quite often. Just start writing things down. Oh man!  I just thought of what I was writing last week, about the first football game. I don't think I could ever described the rush when I marched through that tunnel. It was so crazy with over 80,000 people there in one place. watching the band march in. I had the room to myself this weekend. My roommate went out of town. It was nice. I love being with people and being with my friends, but I also really enjoy my quite time and my personal time. My roommate is really nice. I feel I've been blessed because we get along so well. I haven't met as many people as I thought I was going to meet up here. well. I guess I have met people, but I haven't made as many friends as I thought. Friendships just take time though. I really wish Michelle was here. I miss her. I was so glad we worked everything out before we went our separate ways. She is always been such a great friend. I respect her so much. I don't know what I would do with myself if it had been my mom. That is another one of my big fears. losing a loved one. When Michelle's mom died so suddenly a couple of years ago we were all so shocked. I don't think there was one of us that didn't give our own Mom's huge hugs the day we found out. I was so upset, and Michelle had me call everyone and tell them. That was so hard. So many people thought it was a cruel joke. Why do people do that?  Go into denial. I guess I would have if somebody had called me and told me that. That was two years ago. Time flies so fast. It doesn't even seem like two years. Only like yesterday. Sometimes I wish we could just freeze time. During those special moments or the happiest time. just make time stop. even if it just added and extra minute, I think it would be nice. Oh look, my time is almost up. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I wonder when my sister is going to be back from her meeting?  I am getting a little hungry. Kym's fan is so loud, and it is making the room so cold. I think I should turn if off in a second. It smells like chocolate in here which is making me even more hungry. I miss my cousin Tabby so much being three hours away is too far. I wonder what my brother is doing right now. He probably has football practice. I hope we win the football game this weekend. That reminds me, last weekend was so crazy I don't think I am ever going to drive someone else's car again. Gee that was an adventure though. I think I should wash clothes later because the pile is getting pretty high. Why does my phone light keep turning off and on? I really need to get a new one already. I hope my friend likes the birthday present I bought him. Everyone deserves a great present on their twentieth birthday! That new cd that I bought is great I actually feel like listening to it right now. Oh great I have calculus homework. That stuff is so confusing. It was just yesterday when I was talking to Joseph and he was saying he is having a hard time in his class over at Tech. He said, I wonder what I got myself into. "" And I began wondering that myself. Okay what was that cow noise that I just heard from my sisters computer? That thing is always making the weirdest sounds. My sister is so smart; I wish things came to me as easy as they come to her. But what do I know I'm just the middle child. My brother and sister are always saying I have ""middle child syndrome,"" but what is that anyway. I wonder if my dad is out of work already. He always has a busy work load. Man I never realized how many sacrifices he has really made for our family. I mean considering he is the only working parent and he has two children in college. Wow my dad is really smart too. And what do you know my dad and sis are alike in so many ways. I wish Tabby would come and visit us. I think it would be even better if she came to college up here too instead of back home. I am really attached to her. I mean we have spent almost everyday of our lives together and now I barely even get to see her on the weekends, and with college, it makes it even harder to keep in touch. I wonder how Danielle is doing at Duke. I bet she is having a ball. That is her dream college and I can't wait to hear the stories at Christmas. I wonder if my mom is making dinner back at home right now. Mmm I can almost smell it all the way over here. I am still hungry maybe I should go downstairs to get something to eat. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I wonder why they have a sticker reminding us to conserve energy by turning out the lights, yet it stays approximately 69 degrees in my room. I had to sleep under a blanket today to stay warm, and I'm generally a hot natured person. The thought of winter coming makes me really excited. I like summer, but it just stays too hot. Maybe I should have gone to college in Colorado or somewhere a lot cooler. I don't know how some people like the hot weather so much. I'm just always hot. I get it from my dad, he is the same way. We are similar in many ways, and we can think the same things, and know what each other is thinking without saying anything. Joseph was another person I could do that with, but I never see him anymore. He should come down and visit, I know he likes it in Austin. I am surprised that I am so aggravated that my old girlfriend is going back out with an ex boyfriend she had before me. I don't even live in the same town anymore, I'm 3 and a half hours away, why does it matter. Maybe if I had something or someone to occupy my thoughts, I wouldn't care as much. So far, I have been really disappointed with the college parties I have been to. They are nothing like the ones on TV, which I know TV isn't reality, but it is close (sometimes). I almost wish I hadn't brought my TV, it's too easy to sit in front of it for hours on end. I need to be out meeting people, not watching about famous musicians that make millions upon millions of dollars for being cool. I would love to be a famous artist, but it's never going to happen, so I might as well make myself as popular as possible here. The more people you know the better off you are. If that's true, I'm in trouble. The friends that I had down here before I moved are still my friends, but I want to find my own group. I feel welcome among my other friends, but I don't feel at home. I have to meet my friends on my own, not just borrow someone else's. The FIG is stupid. When I signed up for it, the only reason I did it was because it made it easier to get my classes lined up. Now they want us to do things together, and they expect us to all like each other, and want to be friends. There is one girl in there I'd like to get to know, but as far as the rest of them, two thumbs down. I tell myself I'm going to talk to people when I sit next to them in class, but every time I end up convincing myself not to. In my hometown of Boyd, TX, there were about 350 students in my high school, so I knew everyone, and anything they had ever done. Now I'm going to a school of over 50,000 students. No one would even know if I didn't show up for a month. In Boyd, I'd have a search party of parents and friends looking for me. Fifteen minutes goes by fast when you are busy. I sometimes just watch the clock when I'm bored, like in church. This weekend will be the best one so far. I am preparing myself for being extremely social, and nothing can stop me. Plus, I want to be at a party that actually has some girls at it that I find attractive. I'm tired of these people who don't care about their appearances. Dress to impress. I never go out looking worse than I want people to see me as. It's hard going from being one of the most popular people in school, graduating valedictorian, and being like by everyone, to being a fish in the ocean. I am nothing special here. There is nothing that I can do, or that I know that someone doesn't do better, or know more about. That has been a really humbling experience. "
Tell me about yourself.,"okay so I'm sitting here in the computer lab in simkins dormitory     hall, realizing that I cannot type very well. how embarrassing to keep     deleting. it is so hot in here and I hate macintosh comps. I wish I     had a laptop in my room. I wish I had money. my roommate brought a     computer, and a tv. I feel like the poor one in the room. I actually     decided to do this assignment now because my roommate has two     guests over right now. they are two very nice girls but I just wanted to     get away. I just barely got back from houston at about 10 and I need     some alone time. what a weekend I had. my friends tiffany, and     diana and I went to these auditions saturday for a winter guard called     emblem281. a very renounced performance group. anyway, it is a very     fun group a kids and I was really excited about the audition. I first     and foremost am a dancer. since the audition consisted of dancing     and flag work I excelled in the dance portion. my flag work was not bad     either. don't you hate when you want something and everybody says,     oh you're going to make it"". and then you don't? that's right, tiffany and     diana made it and not me. it is because I don't spin rifle and I know     the instructor wanted a male rifle line. it is pretty sad. I really wanted     to be in this group that just has so much fun together. but what     really hurt the most is the fact that I feel I fail at everything I go for in     life. let's start at the beginning of my senior year in high school. I     tried out for drum major and was told I'd make it no questions asked. I made it to area auditions on my french horn and was told I'd make     the all-state band no questions asked. I wanted to be section leader     for marching season and ended up not as the president but the vice. came to college didn't make the ballet class for my major, don't have     a spot on the field for the band's chicago show this coming game,     and didn't make it into emblem. wow. I feel a lot better. it just sucks to     be me right now. but I always pull through with God's help. or do I     just get over it? my hair is starting to itch. I think I should shower     tonite instead of tomorrow morning. I wonder why do we itch. what is     the explanation of an itch. are the nerves freaking out and by     scratching does that friction calm the nerves back down? I think     about the reason things happen often. like why do our joints make     the cracking sound? something about the releasing of air or     something. I forget. I must go to sleep soon. I have to get up for     dance class at 8. yeah tell me about it. my mom bought me all these     groceries so I don't have to worry about walking across campus to     eat all the time. I love her so much. even though money is tight, she     always makes a way for me. I will never forget the strings we had to     pull for my high school prom. okay time has expired. this little     assignment makes me feel I should get a journal. I just hope I have     done this right. Ii aiming for an 'a' in the class!        "
Tell me about yourself.,"today was just like every monday and wednesday. I guess it was a little more interesting. my classes seemed more entertaining than usual, although, most of them are pretty entertaining usually. my drawing class at 8 am though is a little tough, just because of the time. living off campus makes my mornings a little more involved than that of the typical"" college student. I have to get up around six thirty to be able to fit my morning routine in. today in my art class we did gestural ink paintings of skeletons. it proved to be alright. that class in general is pretty alright. it seems relatively basic, although it keeps my interest. the intimacy of the class size is what I like. I feel like I know everyone, or at least I am beginning to feel like I know everyone. unlike in this class where I know no one. which really is not a problem. I stay more alert that way. you know, when there is no distractions. I have an essay due friday and I have not started. I'm not worried, although I'm not really calm about it. I know ill do fine, I just don't want to be weighed down with a lot of stuff to do tomorrow. I have worked somewhat hard this week. well, sort of. it feels like less work than high school, but then again, I feel more involved here at ut. ut is really a great place. I am enjoying it very much, and I assume I will continue to enjoy it in my years to come. sometimes I wish I lived on campus like a lot of my friends, but at the same time I don't. I mean I like the fact that I don't have to be on campus all the time. like if I lived there I think I might feel overwhelmed with ut-ness. who knows. right now I'm talking to my girlfriend on the phone as I type. she wants me to come over. I'm debating. I mean I have a lot of work to do, and I have a feeling that it might come to distract me. she is in high school. its hard sometimes, not being able to see her during the day at school, but most days I just go over to her house. its not that far away from mine. that is probably another reason why I don't like the idea of living on campus. just because ill be away from her. I'm so tired. its ridiculous. I took a nap in the library today. I have done that multiple times. its proven to be ok. just a little sleep in the middle of the day helps me stay awake all day. something about walking around campus in the hot sun wears me out. that and waking up early. its funny how accustomed I have come to using this keyboard. I tried typing on the macs at school and I can't type half as fast. I'm curious to know how my friends in other parts of the USA are doing. I have a friend who's going to the college of whooster in ohio. and then I have another friend who is attending the university of wisconsin. both very different world to that of austin. I must say I am very pleased with austin. no place has made me feel more at home. I don't know if I'm saying just because I have lived here all my life, or just because austin is so nice. I like l. a. a lot. it was pretty nice. the temperature was amazing. that is the only problem with austin. its a little hot. but it really is not that big of a deal. I kind of like it sometimes. it separates the natives from the new arrivals. I can't wait for some rain. or at least some cold weather. I want to wear some pants. I can't seen to get myself into pants when its this hot outside. although it is quite cold in the acutal buildings. its not worth it. too much outside time. too much sweating. the book we are reading in my english class is pretty interesting. I recommend it. its called ""fast food nation"". "
Tell me about yourself.,"English is my second language. probably I'll have a few grammar mistakes and phrases that don't make sense. I've just watched a really good movie, it's one of those movies that really keeps you thinking. but anyways I don't want to talk about that. I don't know what to talk about. I'm having lots of reading, I chose lots of reading subjects, but I'll be able to handle it. it's just a matter of organizing correctly my time. the more busy I am, the better my academic results are. it has always been like that. if I have lots of things to do I organize my time better than just sitting there in front of the tv. doing practically nothing. I love that though but I prefer being busy and having lots of responsibilities. This semester I'm not only taking 15 hours per week but I'm also in a student organization, in belly dance class, in intramural soccer besides from adapting to this new university-freshman idea. I like this task. it seems pretty pointless and useless but I like writing whatever. in french it would be best defined as N'importe quoi. I love France. I really miss that country but I don't think I'll ever live there again. I don't know why I have this strange feeling that I'll stay here in the US. I don't really want to but I know that I'll end up finding a tempting work here. I'll marry a guy from here as well. I don't know it's just this sixth sense I have. but life gives many turns. life is like a box of chocolates. you never know what you'll get. hehehehe. Forrest Gump. I wonder what Tom Hanks is doing right now. his last movie was a couple of years ago. is he doing a new one or is it just that he has retired and is dedicated to profit of what his career has left him? My mother, she might be thinking a lot about me. I know she misses me but at the same time, she is really happy to know that I'm here. following my dreams"". Florent. when will I'll be able to dump him? It's just something extremely difficult. I'm used to his weekly calls and although I don't love him, I like having someone thinking of me. I want a boy in Austin. I need a guy. I like compromises and being with someone. life turns easier when you have a boyfriend. don't you think? I realize that I'm a very dependent person. not on my family or my friends but on men. or a man at least. if I were a man, I would have my own harem and I would be surrounded by them. sounds pretty cool uh? I think that in a future life I will be an extremist feminist (if you understood that title!) and I will fight for women's rights. not in this life. (it's one of this strange feelings I get) but in a future life. In this life, I'm going to dedicate myself to succeed in life. what is success for me? It has something to do with PRESTIGE-POWER-MONEY. I am someone who qualifies for those 3 things. I will get them. I'm an ambitious person. I end up getting what I want. we'll see, we never know. life is like a piano. depends on how you play it. I am all philosophical today with this box of chocolates, and the piano and this superficial phrases that are very commercial but are always useful when you can't explain something. like RELIGION. Holy sake! What a complicate thing that is! How many wars and deaths that usually brings?! What a stupid thing. like today 9-11 I think a lot about that and about Pinochet as well but whatever, religion is the opium of the masses. another commercial phrase but very very true. Marx and his communism! That was about it for tonight. I have to continue reading Hobbes and his political system for my Quiz. my life is being reduced to reading and reading and reading. but I like it, as I said (and this is to emphasize it) I LIKE HAVING RESPONSABILITIES. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Ok so what am I doing right now?  This is really weird, I've never really had to think about my thoughts like this and actually record them. I really don't want to be writing this right now. I would rather be watching Bring It On"" with my roommate right now. Man I am so tired. I would also really like to go to bed right now and the sad thing is it's only like 7:30. I really haven't been getting too much sleep here. I've been too busy. Man my whole body just hurts because I'm so tired. Even though I'm so tired I know I won't go to sleep till late. Why do I do that?  Man I'm so distracted right now. All I want to do is watch that movie. I'm hearing the scene right now and I don't even have to see the picture because I know what is happening because I've seen the movie so many times. This dorm life is so different for me. I'm use to being able to get away and escape in my room, but I can't do that here. It's weird I always have someone around, whether it's my roommate or a friend from down the hall. Don't get me wrong I love having people around all the time, it would just be nice every once in awhile to have some alone time and reflect on some things. But I doubt that will happen anytime soon. I can't get the fact out of my head right now that I'm so tired. I really should take a nap or just go to bed. But that won't happen. I really miss some of my friends from back at home. It's so different because I went from seeing my best friends everyday to now barely ever seeing them or barely ever talking to them. I told myself before I went off to school that I wouldn't let this happen but it has only been about three weeks and I've already let it happen. That makes me sad. My friends back at home were such a big part of my life and now it seems that they are almost being replaced. I've meet some awesome people down the hall and I really enjoy hanging out with them. Man I can't concentrate. The movie is so distracting. See right now at home I wouldn't be typing here with all this sound. I would have gone into my own room and been able to focus. But I've realized that in college you really can't do that. Right now my roommate is blow drying her hair, that is also distracting me. I need some peace and quite sometime. But that rarely happens. I'm so excited about the football game this weekend and the fact that the weekend is coming up. I love not having to worry about classes and I love being able to relax and really enjoy myself. That kind of makes it sound like I don't have a good time ever but I do I just love the weekends. My roommate is laughing at the movie and I just want to be finished with this so I can watch it with her. I'm really happy that my roommate and I are getting along so well. I really had my doubts when I came to school with her. But it has been great so far. Watch that all of the sudden change because I'm talking about how good it is right now. With my luck something like that would happen. The hair dryer started up again. I really do have trouble focusing with all the sound around me. The people down the hall are so noisy. They play computer games till all hours of the night and yell so loud at the screen. I really don't understand that. Nothing can be solved my yelling at a stupid screen. It's like the same idea of yelling at the t. v. during a football game. It's so stupid. But people will always do it. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I really don't know what to type. I wonder what this keyboard is made of. I really hate it when I type and I have to keep on pressing the backspace. The air conditioning unit is really load in here right now and it's really cold. My neck hurts. What the heck is that on the ceiling. was it there before? I remember in junior high when we all used to chew up paper and make spit-wads to throw at the ceiling and see who could get the most stuck. Is that how you would spell spit-wads? There's so many words that I'm not quite sure how to spell. I remember I used to hate spelling tests in elementary. Wow, I couldn't believe that I sat next to someone today in my Calculus class who was actually in my kindergarten class! I hadn't seen him in forever. I must say it really freaked me out. It was hot today. The walk to the business school killed me. On the one hand I love that I live in Kinsolving. Great food. Nice people. Close to the drag. Plus a whole lot of my classes are near Kinsolving. When did Lisa leave? It must have been around 12. I wonder when she is getting back. I'm excited to go home tomorrow. even if it is just for a few hours. I left so much stuff there! I mean, I would have my mom just send it to me, but if I give her the permission and opportunity to go through my stuff in my room, there's no telling how long she would search, and definitely no telling what she would find. That's not to say that there's anything significant that would get me into any trouble. but I know that there's old notes from junior high. crazy pictures from those crazy party nights. and who knows what all else. Man, that timer thing at the top of this page is making me nervous for some reason. I definitely hate timed tests. Such as the SAT's. For starters I hate the fact that it's a standardized test. Secondly, I hate that it's timed. And above all else I HATE the fact that colleges weigh your application so heavily on your scores. Now I know that it makes sense to do it that way because they need some way to evaluate your intelligence in comparison to all other applicants. However, some people are just not good test takers. ME! In school I can study, understand, and learn material that enables me to do well on my tests and quizzes. But going into a test not knowing exactly what it will ask makes me so intimidated and nervous. See, look at me. When I start talking about tests and intelligence scores I try to make coherent sentences; in other words I try to make myself seem intelligent. Enough of that. What else am I thinking about. I can't believe that I am actually in college. It sounds so clich, but I can remember just yesterday when I was in elementary school. how my biggest concern was who I was going to play with after school. or what time recess was. It was great being a kid. That's not to say that I don't enjoy the freedom that I have now, but with freedom comes tremendous responsibility. I have my mom on my mind and I think that's what made me type that sentence. I just noticed that at the beginning of this writing assignment it was a lot harder to sit and type exactly what I was thinking at that moment. I would think of something and then type it. Now my hands seems to just be flowing, my fingers just seem to be hitting keys. That's weird to me for some reason. Well I only have a couple of minutes left. To me, 20 minutes sounded like a long time to sit and type random thoughts, I figured I wouldn't be able to do it. But here I am. This chair is so uncomfortable. It's so hard and so wooden. At least it's not a big, soft chair because I would never get anything done. I would fall asleep ten minutes after sitting in it and trying to read. Reading. Something that is my downfall. I do love to read, but making sure that I have read certain material and being held accountable for it is a totally different story. Ouch. Something just bit me and I'm a little curious to know what it was. Probably an ant. ,isn't that gross! We have ants in our dorm room! "
Tell me about yourself.,"my room seems nice, I mean it's not like home or anything, but the privacy compensates. I wonder what mom and dad are doing. Hopefully we throw the surprise party for mi tia Juany    but anyways, my roommate is making noise by the mirror. it's sort of irritating how she just takes control of the tv when it belongs to me and I turned it on. I simply left downstairs for 5 minutes and I come up to see her lying lazily on her bed with my remote changing the channel, just surfing the channels when I wanted to watch the my show. anyways now that that is out I can continue. yeah, my roommate just told me the milk carton is spilling and now she is cleaning the refrigerator. I went back home last weekend. I bought a couple of books which I want to read, but seem to have no time to do it; I have a ton of class reading. well, biology seems like it's going to be easy, chem. a little work, nutrition just pay attention during class. c. c a lot of reading. my roommate always eats late at night and I'm trying to help her get better eating habits, but in my opinion, she is not really willing or up to getting on a diet or losing any weight. her brother called tonight and asked to talk to me or something along those lines. this is the second time someone has called for her and she then hands the phone to me, like I want to talk on the phone with them. I don't like talking on the phone. I should probably tell her not to hand me any calls unless I'm doing absolutely nothing; I don't like to get distracted especially if I'm watching tv, or doing some kind of school work. she (roommate) just finished informing me right now that the washer and drier are . 75 cents     yeah, I haven't done any laundry since I got here but I can still manage with what I have in my closet. I really need to get some organized all of my books and and papers. well, it would help if I got all my book first. I'm missing one coincidently it's psy, I went yesterday and they have no more. hopefully by tomorrow they do I need to go over there after class. thank goodness I only have one class tomorrow. I have to finish my ch and c. c homework, shower, check mail, write my tuition check. red robin,  I worked there an entire year last year,  too much work for not enough money. my roommate was my superior there, but I worked as well as she did ,and many of times better (simply because the team liked me better)      it's funny that reminds me of the time they were wishing me luck coming over here living with her. don't get me wrong my roommate is a great girl; I've known her since 5th grade. I like her confidence the way she can just talk to someone and say what's on her mind. yeah, they're calling her up to ask her to work this weekend, I'm not working there until the break. yeah, this time around I'm registering for my classes early, so I don't have closed classes like this semester    but I have to admit my schedule is pretty cool this semester, having to move a lot of things around    well time is almost up    so later            "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am writing this for psychology class. I'm glad it accounts for part of our grade because I am nervous about the difficulty of the class, and I know this is a completion grade. I really really want an A, but I read the professors pick-a-prof reviews and now realize how hard it will be. There is so much reading, I do not know how I can keep up with it. There is a good song playing on my computer right now, Calling You"" by Blue October. The class DJ should play it in our class, even though it really does not have anything to do with psychology, but it does not seem like much of his music does. Yesterday in class, when he walked up there to put on his music, I made a comment like 'oh no, here we go again', and it turns out his friends were sitting right behind me and might have heard me. I felt kind of bad. I don't know what psychological value can be obtained from this. I find it hard to believe people will be reading all of this. Now  an Incubus song is playing, its a slower, relaxing type song called ""Echo"". Everytime I hear it it reminds me of the friend who introduced it to me. And for some reason it reminds me of us playing beach volleyball. I have no idea why, the song has nothing to do with volleyball. That seems to happen a lot, when I read/hear something and it reminds me of something else vividly, for no apparent reason. There was this book I read by dean koontz, I can't remember the title (I read a lot), and everytime I read it, for some reason I would play the Staind CD in my head. I think its probably because the book is sort of dark/gloomy, and all of Staind's songs are depressing and miserable. I don't know why I like them. So every time I hear a staind song now, it reminds me of that book. I always picture the book cover. I remember it was a really weird book, about these creatures called from some abyss of Hell by some voodoo guy, in all sorts of shapes and sizes, and they hunt this guy and his family no matter where they go. they always get in to the buildings through the ventilation system. I can still picture them hissing and scratching at his kids. Dean Koontz is a pretty good writer like that. he is good at making the strangest things real enough to you that you can picture them. The only thing I don't like about his books is that they are so predictable. This is how they always go: There is always a strong, independent main character, either strongly in love with their spouse or single. The main character also either encounters or owns a playful, intelligent dog. I think dean koontz really likes dogs, usually labs. The main character then comes upon some problem tat he/she can't really help but to fight, because its affecting them in some way. For example, one guy had a growing voodoo doll attacking him, one lady had a psychologist (haha) using hypnotism to control her and several other people, giving them bizarre fears (hers was of herself, one guy had a look-alike twin of his out to kill him. just weird stuff. So on the way of fixing the problem, the main character always falls in love with some stranger they meet along their journey, or they fall even more in love with their present spouse. and it ALWAYS ends happy. Therefore I no longer read Dean Koontz books. I know what is going to happen after I have read the first chapter. Now a song called ""I Stay Away"" by Alice in Chains is playing. the guy across the hall in my dorm downloaded it for me because he said my taste in music needed improving. It is good. Lets see, 3 minutes to go. Dr. Pennebaker keeps mentioning in class that we freshman should be feeling depressed/confused at this point in our lives. it seems like he is trying to make business for the mental health people that he mentioned. I personally am not overwhelmed at all by this college thing. It seems just like high school, for me at least. I was always pretty independent. didn't rely/see my parents much. And you don't really notice the big classes. I still go to bed/wake up at pretty much the same time. we do have a lot more free time here, because your life is not so structured, but I think out of habit I am structuring it myself. 20 minutes are up, goodbye. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Today has been a pretty good day. I am a little worried about my computer class because I can't understand what they are talking about, but oh well. I am printing out a reading assignment for my history of rock and roll class and it is taking a lot of paper. I wish my ex would call me just to check and see how I am doing. Never mind, don't think about him; he doesn't deserve the time. I start rowing tryouts next week and then the week after that, too. Hopefully I will make the team. That would be really cool, except if I made varsity somehow, I would miss my family. If I was on varsity I would get to travel a lot, all over the US, but I would be gone all the time on the weekends, and never have a chance to go home and see my family and friends. I think college is harder than I thought it was going to be. But, the internet up here, the DSL I have at my apartment, is really fast. I downloaded some songs in like  two minutes, versus two hours at my hometown. My shoulders are hurting, and I am a little cold. I need some extra sleep. I shouldn't have gone home this weekend and partied till the sun came up Friday and Saturday. I think I ate too much earlier, and now I am too full. Well, I know I have a lot to do tonight. I have rhetoric, calculus, this thing, and a shit load of reading to do. I took care of my pretesting last night so now I don't have to worry about it. I really need a neck and back massage. I miss talking to my grandma every night. I miss living with her too. College is a new horizon, but it is a good one though, because I am responsible for more things than I use to be. I just miss the security I think I felt in high school. If I thought back, I'm sure I would realize that high school was just as stressful back then, as college is now. But I need to relax, and just take it day by day because that is the only thing I can do if I don't want to end up living in a box on the street. I hope everything works out the way I always dreamed it would, and I hope I end up in a job that I love. I don't want to spend thirty years in a job that I hate. I would like to make some money, but that isn't everything to me. I would much rather be happy than rich. Sometimes, though, I don't think that way. I know I am spoiled rotten, at least as much as my parents can afford. And what they can't, my grandma makes up for it. It is going to be hard on me when she dies. But I am not going to think of that now, because that is in the Lord's hands, not mine. I wish Dwayne would call me. Why?  Why do I keep saying that?  Damn. That is why I am going to stay up here next weekend. If I stay up here, maybe, HOPEFULLY, I won't think about him as much. And, I will have more time to get all this work done, and catch back up. I have slacked off the past couple of days, and now I'm going to pay for it. Especially tonight, I am hoping to get caught back up. I wish I could go to bed right now. I am cold. Need to turn the thermostat down. Maybe it would save some money if I didn't keep it so cold in here all the time. But, if I didn't have wet hair right now, and had blow dried it, I wouldn't be cold. In fact, knowing me, I would be hot. Okay, my eyes are starting to hurt looking at this computer screen. I wish I had pants on, instead of shorts, then I wouldn't be cold. I wish I had turned the thermostat down before I started this stream of consciousness. I was going to major in psychology, and it seems very interesting to me, so I am glad I am taking this class. There is a guy outside doing his skateboard thing. He makes a lot of racket, and he isn't even good--and I don't know anything about skateboarding. I also wish the man above my apartment didn't stomp around all the time. He does it at like six in the morning, and eleven or twelve at night. I mean, when does this fucker sleep?  Oh, gosh, anyway, it pisses me off. If I lived upstairs I wouldn't stomp around like that. It is mean to the poor soul living downstairs. I wish I could go shopping instead of doing the homework I am going to have to do. That would be nice. I don't know if I am going to get a chance to go shopping this week. That sucks really bad. I want to buy some new tennis shoes, and some flip flops. Yeah, and go to Academy. I hope college gets easier as I get used to it more. I hope it happens soon. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm just sitting here typing. Mu light is pretty bright. I got it at office max. I got it with my mom the last night she was here in Austin before she went home. We had gone to target earlier that night and I saw one of my friend's car parked outside. It was weird because he is going to Syracuse in New York. My psychology book says Gazzaniga on it and I am assuming that that is one of the writers of the book. There's a picture of my sister and me on my book case. We went to Florida last summer. It was fun. We stayed on a tiny little island with my entire family . There is a little Buddha guy sitting next to the picture looking at me. He is not actually looking at me because he doesn't have eyes, but his carved out eyes are pointed in my direction. My grandparents gave it to me. They are pretty cool. My grandfather was in the navy. I've been to Maine many times and I always go to my mom's uncle's house and play with all my little cousins. Those are some fun times. I'm taking Management Information Systems 310 with Dunn. She seems pretty cool. The book is red and has a little blue box on the side that says Prentice Hall. Come to think of it, I think my econ book is also published by Prentice Hall. I was listening to a song earlier by a band called Outlandish. Good song. There's a sticky note underneath my lamp. My mom gave me this biscotti tub. I don't know why, but she did. I keep mints in it. I have a pack of green gum sitting next to me. It's doblement, the good kind. I'm already tired of writing and I'm only 6 and a half minutes in to this. I still have mono so that could be attributing to my tiredness. I have had it since late February, early March. It's a pain in the butt. I was fine for a while, but right before school started, I could feel it coming back. It's weird how I can feel it coming back. My roommate had to go to some scholarship dinner. I don't know when he will be back, but he is pretty cool. My computer speakers were made by Harmon/kardon. I had never heard of them before. Maybe I had, but they aren't a big named company yet. This could be their way of promoting their product. By striking a deal with HP. My monitor is big. It's a 17 inch Flat Panel. It's nice on my eyes. I used to sometimes wear contacts. I hate those things. They make my eyes all messed up. By the end of the day, my eyes hurt so bad, I can't even stand to keep them open. So I decided to go with glasses. I wear them at night and when I'm in class sometimes. I can see alright without them, but there is some things that I really need them for. My spanish teacher is kind of weird. I wasn't sure what I thought of him at first. But he seems like an alright guy. I saw him at the gym the other day. I need to work out more. But sometimes I'm just too tired or not in the mood or just don't want to go. My ex-girlfriend used to encourage me to go. I actually started going for her. But then gave it up when I got mono. I used to go to the athletic club. I remember walking in from the cold december days after school. It was still cold in january and february. I love the feel after working out. When my whole body feels numb. I don't know what causes it, but it feels good. It's even better when you work out inside and then go outside where it's really cold. I love that feeling too. But yeah, I went running the other day and got that numb feeling when I was done. My dad runs a lot. He is super cool. He went to West Point and all that and still he is a lot of fun. He is serious when serious stuff needs to be done, but all the other times he is cool. My mom does a lot for me too. She helped me move in and whatnot after my dad had to go back. I haven't eaten candy since I have been here. I have decided that candy is one thing that I don't need. I've been trying to eat better and I think I've been doing a good job. I take vitamins every morning and try to eat something too. I have never eaten breakfast and I regret not doing so. I have started trying to eat breakfast but it's just not appealing to me. Oh well. My ceiling has all these little bumps in it. My mom painted my sisters room and used a sponge thing and made the walls kind of bumpy. It is cool. It reminds me of a sky kind of. I went to the football game on Sunday. That was awesome. Quite the blow out. It rained a lot of the game, but it was still fun. It was my first UT football game. My sister goes to TCU and I went to one of her games, but they have no school spirit. Here, everyone gets involved and that's what makes it so much fun. I went down to the box office to get a football ticket for a friend, but they said that I probably wouldn't be able to get one because they were almost all sold out and I would have to wait until Friday to even try. It should be a good game though. We are playing Arkansas at 11 am. Early game compared to last weekends 6pm game. Last game I went in to the wrong gate and had to walk all the way around to find my seat. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well this weekend has been really different. I guess that's because it was the first"" actual weekend that my friends and I actually went out and ""explored"" Austin. I know that we have been here for two weeks already and haven't ""explored"" Austin, but I think it was better this way. The first weekend we didn't want to go home and deal with all the emotional issues that we had dealt with just two weeks ago. It was also weird this weekend because not one of our friends was with us. She had in a way ""made new"" friends, which is alright with me and everything it is just that she was trusting them as soon as she heard that they wanted to go and party in Austin. What was really scary was that last night my friend went out with these girls that she has only know for a week and they went drinking at some party. I don't mind the drinking issue or her not hanging out with her old friends from high school, it's just that she was leaving Austin (the party was in San Antonio) and the driver said she wasn't going to drink a lot. I was kind of in awe that my friend left with people when the designated driver was even drinking. I feel that even if the designated driver has at least one drink than that person shouldn't drive. I guess that's what this whole college experience is all about. People are responsible for making their own decisions here. No one is here to tell them what to do and no one should. These people are adults now and can think for themselves. I also know that another reason I didn't want to or even want to go home until I really have to is to deal with the emotional issues of leaving my family, especially my mom. I know that I'm close to my father and my younger sister, but it seems that every time I talk to her on the phone or when she came to visit last Thursday, I felt like I needed to cry. I don't know why I felt like that. I know that we're very close but I really don't want to deal with that issue of me not being able to let go of my childhood and become that adult that my parents have tried to raise me to be. I also have another worry on my mind. One of my guy friends had be accepted to the University of Houston and he was rooming with my best friend's boyfriend and according to them, everything was great. My guy friend had been dating this girl for the past four months now and she had helped him move in and settle. And this past summer they had spent, from they told my friends and I, nearly every day together. Or if they weren't together, they at least had talked to each other one the phone for a couple of hours. To me that sounds kind of like they couldn't leave each other alone or trust each other but I don't know if that would be normal because I haven't really been in a relationship like that. Well to continue with my worry, according to my best friend's boyfriend, our guy friend had been kind of sad about missing his girlfriend (she is going to the University of North Texas in Denton). Every time his girlfriend would call him, he would get sad. And my best friendn's boyfriend would try and get him out of the room and go around the campus, and he would be happy, however as soon as she called, he would get sad again. And of course we all understood that him missing her was normal. Well the University of Houston started two days before we did and that Monday night our friend had been talking to his girlfriend and was mad because he had missed her. Well apparently she gave him her credit card number and he took a plane flight to Denton. And he told my best friend's that he was never coming back. What we don't understand is why he decided that. This is his first relationship and they already have given each other ""a promise ring"" or a ""promise gift"" because she gave him a realy expensive watch with a diamond in it and he gave her the ring. What my friends and I don't understand is what is going on through his head. Well my time is almost up. I have like ten seconds left so I guess that's it. "
Tell me about yourself.,"today is a bad day. my boyfriend and I of 2 years just broke up because he is     at another university and is rushing right now. I have always been the center of his     world and now he acts like he doesn't even want to talk to when except for when it     is convenient for him. His roommate told me last night that he has cheated on me     and when I first heard that I got so sick to my stomach and had to run to the     restroom. Jared, has been the ony guy that I have ever loved and I thought I would     marry him. we spend holidays together and I am already a part of his family and     he is part of mine. To think of him being with someone else just kills me and I am     so torn up right now that I cannot concentrate on anything but him. I had to end it     because I cannot continue to be hurt when all I have done is devote my whole life     to him. he assured me all summer that things would be fine with us apart and that     if he was to join a fraternity that it would never get in the middle of what we had     together. My thoughts are horrible right now and I NEVER thought that I could feel     so hurt and ashamed. My biggest fear is that he won't even care because he will     just move on since he is so involved and has so many opportunities to meet other     girls. Jared has been the sensitive one in our relationship since day one and he     was always worried about me forgetting about him. he was always the one that     couldn't stand not to see me for one day, and he was so in love with me tat     sometimes I got annoyed by it. Now the tables have completely turned because I     feel like I am incapable of functioning without him. for the past 2 years, everything     has been about him and so now I just don't know what to do with my time. Where do     I even start without him there to say I love you at night , or without him there when I     am having a bad day? This is the worse feeling I have ever felt and I just wish he     knew how it was to be thinking about him every second of the day! He will     probably just go on and not even miss all the times we have had together and just     party all the time like he ahs been for the last two weeks. I helped him move into     his new apartment and was not invited to come since, but all of our friends have     gone over there and seen him, so why did he have to put his own girlfriend in that     position? I have not been real happy lately as it is because I just transferred to UT and     I hate it so far. I don't see anybody I know during the day and I feel so lonely     without jared, and now it will be permanent. This is the worse time for this to happen     and it makes me feel sick when I think about how it probably won't change. We     have always been so in love and people know us as the perfect couple and now     there is nothing perfect about us and all I feel is pain. he is going to the school that     I did last year and is meeting all these new people and having all this fun while I     have been sitting at home dreaming of him and this is what I get for it! I kept telling     myself that it was going to be hard while he was pledging but now its going to be     much harder never knowing what he is doing without me and wondering about     him every day. I am lucky to have a great family that supports me so much to help     me during down times like this, but they have never seen me like the way I am     today. I have seen other people hurt this bad and I just thought to myself that it     must suck to be like that and now here I am in their shoes. he is the guy that has     always put a smile on my face, made me feel loved and made me a better person. I go to sleep at night thinking of him and I wake up in the morning thinking of him. We have had problems before and after a few days he couldn't stand fighting with     me and would brake down and tell me that he hated when it was bad. I keep     telling myself that if we don't talk for a while that he will realize what he ahs lost     and call me explaining he loves me too much to lose me, but I have such a bad     feeling that this time is different and he will just move on. I don't want to move on     but I have to keep myself busy knowing that he is out all the time with other people     because when I think about it too much, it tears my heart up. this is the guy that I     have planned my wedding with and after just 3 weeks of being away he has     already given me up. We have all the same friends and I will not be able to hear     about what he is doing and be able to see him anytime soon until I start t feel     better. I have no energy and It scars me because I don't even want ot do my     homework of study because my mind is in such a  different place right now. He has     put everything in front of me and his roommate told me that he does not think he     cares as much about me right now since he is so caught up in rushing and meeting     people. It just kills me to think that I am here and he is there without me because I     have always been included in everything he does. Now all of a sudden I am shut     out and I hope he realizes that he can't live without me. It is so hard for me to think     of him with somebody else because I know everything about him and what he likes     and does not and I don't ever want another girl to be that close to him. I love jared so     much and I wish he wouldn't have ever left or that I would have stayed there     because things could be different right now, but he enjoys making me jealous     when he talks about all the things he is getting to do. I know that I must just live     day to day knowing that things will get better but right now I can't see myself getting     over this for a long long time. I feel worthless today, am I am a very good person     so what did I do to deserve this? I am just hoping and praying that things can be     patched up between us one day after we both have some time to see what life is     like without each other. I just don't want him to throw everything away, because he     is the best thing that has ever happened to me. I talked to him this morning and all     I could do was cry and when we got off the phone is that feeling that anybody     would hate when saying bye to someone that they love as much as I do. I am only     wondering what he will do for the rest of the day and if I will ever be on his mind     because I usually know what he is doing all the time. I am supposed to be the one     who goes to these parties with him and I am supposed to be with him when he     meets other poeple so they know that I am his girl and now all these girls that have     been in love with him while we have been together are going to love that we have     broken up. I am going on and on about how upset I am its just very hard because I     had never loved anybody before him and it breaks my heart to think of being     without him. And as  for school, I hope it gets better it will just take some     adjustments. I hope jared still loves me as much as he always has! "
Tell me about yourself.,"This is different, I always thought stream of consciousness was a writing style, I never knew it had a basis in psychology. Should I used punctuation, I don't think my thoughts are punctuated. These must be horribly boring to read, the most eclectic thought process and there is that annoying girl with loud voice. And my girlfriend wants to read these, but I don't want her to, she didn't listen to me, how rude. She never listens, just constantly does what she wants, and complains. If she reads this now, she will be understandably upset. We moved down to Texas together from Northeastern University in Boston and its been more stressful than I had imagined. I was the impetus behind our transfer and feel some guilt whenever she doesn't enjoy something, and constantly want her to have a great time, even though I share some of her misgivings. Although I have to say the campus is great, the school is good, and I enjoy going to class; however, UT did not match up to my expectations. Its a tier one school and I expected more, I can detect little difference between here and Northeastern, except Northeastern has more money. Do we compare our writings at the end of the year and look at how are thoughts have changed as we have become more integrated into the school?  I hope not, I hope there is some more interesting point to this class. Or maybe, this class will give me a greater ability to analyze the writing which will lead to a deeper understanding of my self. My girlfriend is so stubborn she takes so long to come to the obvious conclusions. She can't study because of the loud girl with the annoying voice and I told her to go to the library and I would join her in twenty minutes, but no, she would rather suffer. Maybe she knows I feel guilty when she does not enjoy something and wants to punish me in some way, or maybe she just wants to be near me. Or maybe she is afraid of change. I heard yawns signal the body is preparing for a change in action or state of being, maybe that is accurate, never heard that before and it doesn't occur in all situations. I did an internship at Northeastern and I hated it, that made me focus a lot more on school. I was always disorganized and rarely put effort into school, after that experience however, I want to get the best grades I can and the widest range of academic experience. I feel that the more ways I learn of analyzing a situation, the more thought processes, the better I will be able to deal with the real world  and whatever I want to do. Mostly right now I want to be a trader, a hedge fund manager, be wealthy. Predominately to have security and independence. Not have to worry about work and do whatever I enjoy. I think that would be economics, write essays on economics, and that ties in with trading and hedge funds, so it is not far. I also am interested in politics and think about running for congress. This paper clearly alters my thought process, I don't lay myself out every time I think, it has an artificial quality to it. Although, in class you said one way to deal with depression and change was to right about it, maybe this homework assignment is a self-help exercise. How come women care more about the personal life and thoughts of other people than men, in general, not every woman. I assume that someone else wants privacy and to be treated with respect but women always want to know what is going on and pry into it. People are interesting to watch though, but there is a lot of commonality in all human actions. People tend to do similar activities, not exact activities, but similar. Groups of people tend to act in similar fashions. That loud girl left, its so much quieter here. I don't know when I am going to graduate, but Ill have 87 credits after this term, and six months of an internship experience, crazy. At some point I need to graduate, that'll be exciting but nerve racking. I'm mostly worried about paying bills and saving for retirement and college for children. Its insane I worry about that, I'm 20, not 40. But being interested in finance makes me think about that now, and how important the first few years in and after college are. Since money in the stock market will double roughly every 7. 2 years on average, its important to start early for retirement. What about all the people in less developed countries, specifically third-world countries. We should do more to help them, humanity only has itself to support it, we shouldn't exploit each other. I wonder what the world would be like if people were able to look beyond the immediate future and into the next 10-20 years. They would see its in their best interest to help those less fortunate. Ending slavery and instituting a minimum wage has caused real wealth to increase, not decrease and society is more stable. Imagine how much better the world would be if everyone had a stable society, could go to college, contribute to humanity and become consumers. There would be more technological advancements, real wealth would increase faster, I'm sure we would find new problems, but things would be better. I'm not sure multilateralism is the answer, institutions do impinge upon our sovereignty, but they are better than a single hegemonic power trying to control the world. There aren't any attractive girls in here, besides my girlfriend. I wonder what that says about the business school atrium at 6 o'clock on a wednesday. Not a happening spot perhaps?  Although there a ton of people here for the cash flow casino. 20 minutes, sweet, I can do other homework. See you Friday. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm so tired right now. I wish I could just sleep in my bed at home right now. Man, my feet smells. I guess it's time to wash the slippers. Gosh, right now would be a good time to get a nice massage. My back is aching now. When will I get used to this new change? I don't know if I can make it. Well, I have to. I must. Everyone expects me to. Of course I expect myself to succeed as well but everything has just been so overwhelming. So much information is given in the class and I don't know what I should write down. Ok. I'm tired of listening to the same song. What are they talking about? It makes no sense to me. Alright. Piano music is the way to go. Yeah. This will relax me. I need to rest my eyes. Can I type with my eyes close? No, I'll probably start typing some wrong stuff and then it'll be a waste of time. Hm. I think I should put this printer box somewhere else. It's kind of annoying me in a way. But then again, I need to put my feet over it for support. Books, books, books. I'm tired of them already. I can't believe I was actually excited about learning all this new stuff. Now I'm dreading every minute of it. My forehead itches. I'm so bored. This is really crazy. My goodness, there's about twelve more minutes remaining. Ah! I think I'm about to fall asleep on this laptop. Hm, roommate's back now. I wonder if she ate dinner yet. She probably went to eat with her boyfriend or so. Hm, do I need anything else for my dorm? I think I should decorate it more. It still looks a little plain at the moment. I guess I should utilize some of my time for creative matters. Yeah. I should make more cranes and turtles to put around my area. Aww. The crane and turtle on my laptop looks so cute. Ouch. I bite my lip. Where did roommate go? She left again already? Maybe she is just now going out to eat since she came back with her backpack just now. I don't know. Geez. Now that guy finally decides to respond me. It's about time. I instant messaged him like a while back. hm. The Asian talent show was quite interesting. That one skit by VSA was pretty cool. Too bad the guy's voice was spoken by a girl. That made him seem pretty gay. Oh okay. So it was a girl's voice because it was suppose to be the voice of a young boy. I see now. Yay! I have four minutes remaining. So what am I thinking about now? Oh man, JAY is so fine looking. I need a bigger poster of him to put on the wall. Gosh I don't like this chair I'm sitting now. It's not very comfortable. I feel like rolling back and forth but there arent any wheels. This sucks! Hm. I should go work out tonight. I have not done that in about a week already. This is not good. I have to stay in shape. I don't want to gain the freshman fifteen like people say. Either way, I just want to be fit. I think I should head out there right now. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am thinking back to when in class you were talking about sitting in front of the computer and wondering what to write about. I wonder what my roommate is saying ?hmmm? for. she may think it is weird that I am writing about her if she reads this. I like rice krispie treats. I just had one. I went to the vegas getaway for the business school; it was fun. my face is itching. my nose, then my neck. I really like what I've done with my hair today, but too bad it took longer than I had expected it to take. my roommate, erika, is leaving. she is going to go get something to eat. now my back is itching. I wonder why, when you itch, simply rubbing on the itching spot doesn't make the itch go away. you have to scratch it instead. wouldn't it be easier if we just didn't itch at all? I mean, what's the point of itching anyway? I guess it just makes the experience of life all the more interesting. also why is it that when you start to itch, you suddenly itch everywhere. kind of like when someone yawns and you see it, it makes you have to yawn too, even if you're not sleepy. I'm spending an awful lot of time thinking about itching. I want to take a speed reading class at the UTLC. maybe it will help me in the future. but will I begin to speed-read everything if I take the course?. I like listening to music. I guess most people do really. my nose itches again. I'm glad it got cooler in this dorm room. last week it was SO hot. I had to sleep on top of my blanket. the good thing is that it therefore provided more padding on these rock-hard beds. I really like the movie Chicago. it's so theatrical. speaking of which, I think my sister had auditions for the high school's fall play today. I wonder how she thinks she did. I hope that she gets a part, even if it's a small one. I'm looking forward to seeing the fall production. maybe they'll make it to state OAP this year. I miss being in theatre. I would like to join a theatre club, but I'm not sure I have time for the rehearsal commitment. plays are a lot of work. I really like this writing assignment you all have devised for us. it's interesting and even kind of fun. I like the box I have on my shelf. it's orange and gold, with a leaf pattern. thank goodness I only have 2 classes tomorrow. today was nonstop; 4 classes with only a 30 minute break. I had a bagel for breakfast. I wonder how early the bagel guy has to get up in order to go to his little stand and be open in time for 8 o'clock classes. I wonder if he likes his job?. he would get to meet and see a lot of people every day; that, I'm sure, is a perk or he would not be living in Austin, or any big city. I'm from a small town. austin still continues to wow me with the massive number of people on campus and on the streets. oh good I get to put my pennant that I bought today up on my board in about 5 minutes. it cost $7. one about 1/3 of the size cost $6. they're probably betting on the idea that people will not check the price of both pennants and simply buy the smaller one, thinking it will cost much less. I had economics today. I think I'm beginning already to think more about the economy. at least I hope so, because if I am, that means I'll do better on the tests. there is a study session tomorrow night that I'll be attending. I need to go running later. I'm really glad that the gym is so close by. in my hometown, you had to drive 35-45 minutes just to get to a gym. so it was either waste all that time, or go run on the hard, uneven, gravel-y, county road. gravel-y is not a word but that's okay. I wonder what psychological experiences you all will get by reading these assignments. 5 seconds left. oh okay my time is up but I get to finish my thought. I'm going to go study now. I have to read my psych book for your class tomorrow. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, here I am writing my paper for psychology. There is so much noise here. Everyone has their stereos on full blast. It's a good thing I have mine. I need to change the song. So many songs that I skipped. It is okay. I found one that I want to listen to. This is a really good song. It is called Judith"" from A Perfect Circle. Their new album was strange. It sounded like a different band, so calm and mellow. I like it anyways because it calms me down. I don't know what I would do with out music. It is so essential to me. I believe that it is my sanity. If I didn't have my music I would go insane. So many feelings and thoughts in the lyrics. I am amazed that someone is willing to reflect on their lives or any given moment and come up with such inspiring. I can't think of the other word I was going to say. I hope I do well in my classes. I am really getting used to this thing called ""college life. ""  I feel at home and myself here in Austin. I've been waiting for a day like this. I still miss my family though, but I am strong. There goes two minutes off my time. My mom called and I had to explain to her something. I sometimes feel confused about who I really am. There are always moments in my life where I take a moment to reflect on myself and existence. I wonder how we did come about existing. So many explanations and theories, it is hard to believe them. I would rather come up with my own explanation. It is hard to, but I still have until the day I die to come up with an answer. I can't believe that two years have past since my uncle died. I will never forget that day. I really never experienced a death in the family. It really changed my outlook on life. I know wherever he is, he is looking over me and seeing how much I have accomplished. So many obstacles in my life and I managed to knock them over to get where I wanted to go. I wonder where I am going to end up in life. This journey is long and treturous. I need to tread with caution. So many threats in the world now a days. What drives the human race to act the way they do. So ignorant and destructive. As long as I just focus on my life and not that of others, I will be fine. It has got me this far. Life is so wondrous and worth living. Twenty one. the beginning of our end. "
Tell me about yourself.,"well let's see, today was an okay day. psy class was pretty interesting. mr pennebaker is a funny guy. too bad I have a feeling that class will be hard. I hope I do good. I really want to make all a's this semester and my whole time here at UT. I'm listening to this new song I really like. I listen to it a lot. its by nasty boy clique and the song is called I want to love you. it is not a dirty song. it's really nice. the first time I heard it, it made me think of this guy I like. it's kinda our story. I like this boy a lot. and he does too. I miss him. this feels weird writing what I'm feeling to someone I don't even know. but anyhow he is 100 miles away from me. he goes to school in waco at tstc. I really hope he does well, and I know he is. as I look at the time its only been 3 minutes plus some. man this sure is going pretty slow. hmm. what else. oh yeah I need to read fast food nation for english class. I hate reading. I was wondering how I would do in college since I don't like to read. I'm doing okay so far, but I don't know. I have to take a quiz in that class tomorrow. I'm lost for words now. my own little writer's block. and a whole 15 minutes left. well no one is in my dorm right now. the 3 other girls are gone. this one girl she sleeps really early like 11. or at least that's early for me. but the bad part isn't sleeping early but she SNORES, and its very loud. gosh we all hear it. jessica just came in the door, and scared me cause I thought it was her. but anyways, I'm bored. I really don't want to do this for 20 minutes but I need to cause I want the grade. what else? oh I ate popcorn. it was nice. it was cheddar. there was an extra bag of cheese to add. yummy in the tummy! :) on my little desk I brought a phone right, and it doesn't work. the phone jack is whack. shikisha's phone jack doesn't work either. only jessica's. lucky her. now I'm looking around my dorm to see what else I could write about. I see the picture of me and brian. that's the guy I like. darn I wish he was here. he will call me when he is out of class. *smiles* hahahaha as I write this I was just thinking that the people who read this and analyze this get that females usually write about relationships, boys, and all that mama drama. mannnnn. I wonder if boys do that too? hahaha. crap I need to to barnes and noble and buy magazineS for english. what a waste. all I need are some ads, along with that I have to deposit a check so I can have some money in my bank account. my friend danny keeps iming me, and his mean self warned me. I will warn him back when I'm done with this. and just now my sister imed me asking who warned me on AIM. I think I should do something today, but I'm not sure. that party at the plaza thing is still going on. but all the organization people are gone. they had some basketball scholarship thing, putt putt golf, and other random things, but I didn't do any of it. I just passed by. my left back hand has *due writing assignment online. and the online is underlined. hehe that was my reminder to do it. I did it after I watched supermarket sweep. cause there wasn't anything else to watch. and I did this cause I had nothing else to do. I wonder if my buddies want to go and do something? gosh darnit I also need to go to that jester thing where they help you with homework. I need some help in math. I guess I just don't understand. woooo hoooo. like 2 more minutes to go and I'm done. in this counting minutes/seconds I will just say. HOLLA [term used in houston. hahaha] a lil ghetto, since austin isn't. "
Tell me about yourself.,"So I'm sitting here writing this thingy for psyche. I feel like a dork for getting this project done so early but I wanted to get it over with. It think it's funny that you, Prof. Penn, may read these and still have absolutely no idea who we are. It must be rough being a prof. in a big class like my PSY301. My mom is always reminding me that I didn't take it in high school and that's what I get for not taking it in high school. a giant class. It shouldn't be a horrible class though. I can't believe someone would paste something in this rather than just writing. I love writing. I've been writing a summer journal for the past 10 years and I love it. I'd love to write for a living but I just do the journal thing well. I could write a journal-type book, or a sex in the city type article. bah, there's no money in anything I want to do. listening to frank sonatra. he is very relaxing. come fly with me come fly let's fly away. ol blue eyes. man, this is going to be harder than I thought. it's only been 3 minutes and 59, 4 minutes, 4 minutes and 5 sec. ok I can't do that forever. what would happen if someone IMed me right now?  would I fail the assignment because I stopped writing?  I should have turned it off. yuck. I just burped. ew, I just wrote that I just burped. see, I had spaghetti for lunch and I can still taste it because the food sucks. I miss home all ready. I feel like a dork because I miss home, and I want to go home every weekend. I need to be social. I need to get out and met more people. there's so much pressure on college to be great because high school blew for me. my head itches. bleh. bleh, what to say what to say. my arm hurts now and it's only been 6 minutes and 11 sec, 24, 16. ok I'll stop for real now. I am a dork for doing my writing assignment so early, aren't I?  I guess no one will know. why do I even care?  I keep switching in and out of I and I. capitals that is. I never do capitals when I'm typing on AIM so why should I do it now. I don't think it capital letters. !  well well well. this better go through. the testing. pre testing that is, doesn't work yet. I hope this works because I don't have a printer that will verify that I actually did the assignment. yea for being a poor college student. actually, I live in san jac and I had no idea that everyone thought this is where the snobs live, geez. genevieve just got on. I wouldn't talk to her even if I wasn't doing this thing. ah, sharp pains in my arm. that's so weird!  I guess it's the constant typing. this is pretty fun actually. except for the pain in my arm. I've got you under my skin. wooo ol blue eyes. geez I'm a  dork. maybe you'll read this out loud to your classes, how mortified I'd be. I just try to blend in everywhere. I know you wouldn't be so mean to say my name, more or less ask me to stand up or something in class. wow, I would die of embarrassment. I'm embarrassed very easily. it had to be you. ah, I miss rex. rex is my boyfriend in michigan. he is really bothering me lately, and it's not fair for me to say he is bothering me. he called me last night to tell me he couldn't talk because his friends from GR came down to hang out with him, and I got all mad that he couldn't talk to me. man that was annoying. I'm not allowed to be mad that he has a social life and I don't. I guess I'm jealous?  I don't think so. I don't know. I wish he would just not nap right NOW when I could be talking to him. I can be mad about that right?  he COULD talk to me now but he decided to sleep. man my arm hurts. bleh        I'm kinda thirsty, can I stop to get a drink. I guess I can wait 10 minutes. HEY this is my favorite frank sinatra song. Luck be a lady. man I want to do a dance to this. I want to learn how to swing dance before my wedding. there are a lot of things I want to do at my wedding, but I wanted to say before my wedding. bleh. weddings. my mom keeps telling me I'll be cut off when I get married. financially that is. she just doesn't want me to marry rex because she thinks he won't be able to provide for me, which is probably true. he really doesn't know what he wants to do. I wish money mattered a little to him. not a LOT but a little. I like this song a lot. a lady doesn't leave her escort, it isn't fair, and it's not nice. this isn't really what you wanted is it?  oh geez, well, why does it matter?  you probably won't even read it. why would you read MY paper out of the 2300 people that you have in your classes?  5 more minutes. I'm tired, my eyes feel so heavy. but I got enough sleep. maybe I got too much sleep. I hate that ann let al sleep on my bed, al smells really disgusting. I don't know how she can date someone that smells so disgusting. my arm hurts. bleh!  my eys feel really heavy. sheish. 4 more minutes. my shoulders feel tired too. I want to go out tonight. I don't want to see major again and I don't really want to hang out with da, but I feel like I need to go out and do stuff. I'm really sick of eating  by myself. really sick of it. it's the worst feeling to watch the evening sitcoms in jester city limits by yourself. how come everyone else has friends to eat with and not me?        lcuk be a lady toooniiiiggggghhhhttt. wow, I'm a giant dork. WOW. how mortified I would be if you knew who I was or if you even read it, or if you *gasp* read it out loud in my class. I'd probably cry and run out. I've been crying a lot lately because of rex. a lot. I really like crying sometimes because it just lets me let it out. I had to go all the way to the edge of campus last night because ann was here with al and was doing. well, whatever they were doing. and I had to go by the river to cry about rex. well, one more minute. I hope you never read this, and I hope I get credit for it. all I ask is that you don't let anyone see it if you really do read it. that would be mortifying. and even if it is a good example for the assignment. I would be so mortified. you have no idea. ok 55, 56, self destruct,     ?        "
Tell me about yourself.,"beck lost cause. juan didn't call me back. I wish he would call me. it's driving me mad not knowing why he took off without saying a word. leaving me hanging and wondering what the hell was happening and why he left me in my car thinking up of the thousands of reasons why he did such a thing. I saw a red car with someone sitting inside of it. I don't know who it was but I can only think that it is his girlfriend, which may explain why he crouched down next to my truck when he got out. like he was hiding. then unexpectedly run back to the station towards the back where the fire truck was. beagles I should call marco up. I need to give cristina a visit at cypress bend. I'll be receiving some mail from angie soon and I'll be unpleasantly surprised because I think I already know what it might be but I don't want to see it. really tired and sleepy. grace and I talked about scary movies last night because we couldn't fall asleep. I want a radiohead tshirt. nirvana. japanese art prints. art sculpture class. sore fingers. two paper cuts on my hands. I wish the dvd player on my computer worked. sean messed up my computer :( goose time goes by pretty slow yet fast. I miss my angelfish and its tankmates. church. too many asians here. I don't like it. juan didn't reply to the voicemail I left him at 9 last night. he is mad because I took off too. I needed to drive back to austin. but I'm mad too because he did the same. I only reciprocated his actions. cold allergies and this smoothie tastes pretty good strawberries. still like the peach smoothie. I was really upset and exhausted after math today. I was shaking up the white cranberry/peach juice bottle to break the frozen juice that was inside of it. I miss joyce. I wonder how she is doing in school. she must have a lot of friends. psychology class is great. never get bored. occupy time. be resourceful. help mom and dad be less stressed out. mom is sick. she wants me to go home every weekend. juan claims he wants to see me. but we're not together"". I don't know what's going on with him and his current girlfriend or fiance or whatever the hell she is to him but from how he is being with me. it makes me wonder. rebecca. I had a dream with him introducing me to his girlfriend elizabeth. except her name was roxanne in my dream. she was voluptuous and desirable. it made me sad. he always makes me sad. I'm reminded of that time I went to best buy with my sister and while passing by the movie theater parking lot. I spotted his car. the metallic sky blue eclipse. I was going to get a cream/white one. o well. and so I drove in front to see if it could be his car. it was his. I am so stupid to have stayed outside at the theater waiting for his movie to end just so I could see who he went to the movies with. joyce was playing arcade. when I saw him come out. he was the first one to come out. he was with a girl. he had his arm around her and I turned away just before he looked towards me. he passed right by me and walked away with his arm around her. and I stood by the window watching them leave. I got outside too and I just got so sad. I wasn't depressed. I was simply really truly sad. she was kind of chubby though. probably because she is pregnant. if all of that nonsense was true. abortion. legal age. drinking strawberry daquiri. applebee's johnny carino's Rick. marble slab. I wish I could talk to Rick right now. talking to him briefly yesterday on my drive to austin actually kind of cheered me up after I had left the fire station in pain. my heart has been broken yet I still hang on to someone who only wants my body. I miss being held by him. I miss being hugged by a guy. jason and sean are so weird. grace is weird too yet she always brings in weird people and claims that they're weird. silly girl. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, I am just sitting here and listening to a cd, The Wallflowers Bringing Down the Horse. It is a great cd and classic rock and it kinda of makes me feel old because the cd came out in 1996. My roommate is here in the room with me talking to a friend on the phone. This song definitely reminds me of middle school. It makes me what to sing along. I am kinda of feeling lazy I don't know what it is about thursday but I already start to think is the weekend. I do have a lot to do though I need to read for my Mexican American Studies and biology. I already have a biology test next friday and I am getting a little anxious about the first test. It is hard to know what to expect from a professor until you take the first test. It is starting to get a bit cold in my room I guess I'll put on my sweatshirt. I need to make a grocery list so I can go to the grocery store tomorrow. I need to call my mom also and my friend Stephen who lives in Boston I haven't been able to get a hold of him he is really busy with school. He just started his masters in music. I need to take out the trash it is starting to smell funny and I need to clean the bathroom it is my turn this week. I am thinking about what to get my mom for her birthday and what to get my parents for their 25th anniversary. I wonder when it is going to get cooler the hot weather is starting to get on my nerves the humidity is unbearable. I wonder if it is actually going to rain today because all week long the weather people have been saying it is going to rain and then it never does. That is quite annoying yeay I am half way done with this writing assignment. ouch I just bit my lip I always chew my gum too fast. wow this twenty minutes is going by a bit slow. I want to see a movie this weekend but I am not quite sure what I want to see I better go online later to see what has come out this week. My roommate just asked me for some bread so she can make a sandwich because the cafeteria is already closed and she doesn't want to use what limited bevo bucks we do have.   "
Tell me about yourself.,"Don't get me wrong UT is great but there's still something missing: my girl, Maria. Sometimes life just don't make sense. One minute you're the king the next you're down in the gutter. Man I wish I was still with my girl, or shall I say ex. Things are messed up. All cause of family nagging and distance, the whole thing fell through. The hell with this ?oh college is awesome, so many chicks? crap. I had a girl who was good looking, not a ho, who was caring, who was intelligent, and loved me. Thanks to all these circumstances though outside my control, the break up took place, or rather the ?time off? as she put it. What's 230 miles got to do with it? Too bad she is a year younger or that I'm a year older. Things aren't fair in life. Speaking of bad things, my step father has been having problems with his kidneys recently. He started dialysis today back home in Eagle Pass. Funny how me and him used to be at each other's throat but over the last two to three years we bonded and got pretty close. I miss the bastard. It was weird seeing him cry the day that I left. Here was this macho tough guy crying over his step son leaving for college. My mom didn't fair much better either. She had the water works going. That was the toughest part of leaving town. I won't miss Eagle Pass much. Just some of the people I left behind, Maria included. Things change, I went down to watch a Eagle Pass football game last week. It was against our border rivals Del Rio. Trust me these two towns hate each other. They did a lot of talking but we still won the game by 11. Damn I say we like if I played or something. Anyways we beat them down last year by 11 in their place too. Good old? Del Rio, always an easy win. Austin is cool, but man there seems to me there's not many folks like me. All the white people seem to be afraid of me or something. Look in class sometime. I sit way in the back in seat 7 front row and there's always seats next to me open. If someone actually sits down its cause there's no where else to sit. I don't bite and I do shower. I guess people tend to hang with their kind. My kind doesn't exist here. The Hispanics here don't accept their heritage, most anyways. They either want to be white or black. I can't go up to them and say something like ?Que Onda? cause they DON'T know Spanish. Its messed up. My Spanish is decent but I look like a god compared to some of the Hispanics here. Oh well I'm glad that at least my roommate is my friend from my home town. At least we can still ?cag? it together. It's a Tex-Mex term from Eagle Pass, basically meaning to joke around and act stupid. I'll tell you more about the origin another day. Oh yeah Cowboys suck. Come on pull it together men! Win one for the gipper, do something. The team played horribly in the second half. Hope they do better next week on Monday Night Football. Man this is crazy. My foot itches, damn athlete's foot. Should get something for it. Typing late at night is fun. I need to go download the new Obie Trice Album, too bad its only on Mirc right now and I can't get it yet. In due time I suppose. I still have yet to find out how truly hard college life is so far. My roommate has a test today and he spent the whole day yesterday studying like a mad man. I'm glad I'm not taking any science course this semester. Life is good though. Small problems aside I don't have much to complain about other than Calculus, but I'll be fine with it. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Today I had a fairly busy day I believe as I am feeling a bit tired right now. I wonder what time it is. Oh it's 9:14 P. M. right now so I guess I can continue writing this assignment. HaHa I'm just kidding. I feel good about myself right now because earlier today I helped somebody out who needed it. She is my sister's friend, I guess an acquaintance for me, and one of the tires on her car got a flat. She and my sister both didn't know what to do, so my sister called me and I came and fixed her tire for her. After that she bought my sister and me dinner as a way to say thanks. I feel better now than I used to about a week and a half ago because I tried out for the marching band here but I didn't make it. I was really depressed for a day or two because I've been involved with band for the past seven years of my life in high school and middle school. But after awhile I began to realize a few of the benefits of not being in band. For example, I don't have to buy those stupid white plastic shoes all the members are required to wear so I can save some money. Also I have A LOT more free time than I've had in a long time. It feels really good to be able to take long naps in the middle of the day without having to worry about practice"" at 6 P. M. in the evening and interrupting my sleep. Man, that timer on the top of the screen is going really slow. It says it has only been eight minutes but it feels like twenty already. My wrists are beginning to hurt. I want to listen to music on my computer right now but I can't because my roommate is on his cell phone talking to his friend and I know my music will only bother him. We don't share the same taste in music. In fact, I think we are as far as possible in our tastes in that category. I think these chairs they give us for our dorms are very uncomfortable. I mean, they're completely wooden with no cushioning at all. You would think that in the honors dorm we would get special treatment of some kind, but so far I think we are being treated the exact same way as the freshmen who are going to drop out at the end of the semester. It's hard to concentrate right now because I usually need music to help me concentrate. I like the upbeat kind of music that has a constant bass drum playing really loudly on all of the down beats. I also like classical music and music that has drums and stringed instruments at the same time. I'm not sure what the kind of music is called, though. However, I don't like oldies or country music at all. In fact, I hate that kind of music. That's why my roommate and I don't share the same tastes. He likes that kind of music. I just heard somebody running down the hall of my floor at a really high rate. I wonder what they were in such a hurry for at 9:30P. M. Maybe he was running to get more beer for the party. Just kidding again. No need to get investigators up here or anything. But earlier today there was some really loud music coming down the hall and the voices of about fifteen to twenty people, so something was definitely going on. I was thinking about emailing that DJ guy for our class. I don't remember his name, though. I have some suggestions for songs he could use for our class, and one of them would correlate nicely because the song is about some guy who loses his mind and doesn't think he is. He thinks everybody is wrong who is trying to help him. OK! I only have one minute left. After this, I think I'm going to get ready for bed because all this Sigmund Freud type psychology assignment is making me a lot more sleepy. I think changing that tire made me a lot more sleepy than I thought I was when I first started typing this. "
Tell me about yourself.,"My suitemates are talking very loudly in the bathroom. I really should go to bed so I won't be tired in the morning, but I want to get this done so I don't have to worry about it later. The tag on my shirt itches. I need to cut it off. My suitemates left the bathroom, so it's quiet again. My roommate is studying still. Someone just slammed a door down the hall. My suitemates are being loud again. My back kind of hurts. It must be from carrying my backpack around all day. I'm really tired. At least I don't have class until 10 in the morning. I'll get a little more sleep. I need to remember to go to the Co-op tomorrow to pick up the backordered book that just came in. I bet I'm going to end up annoying my roommate typing for twenty minutes straight. I should probably tell her. good, she wasn't paying attention. She asked me why I had to type for twenty minutes. I've only been typing for 5 minutes! My suitemates are still in the bathroom, but they aren't being so loud anymore. My feet hurt from walking all day and my back still hurts. I hope I do well on the economics quiz tomorrow. I studied all my notes and read the chapters. I'm getting sleepier, but I have to finish this. They're being loud again. They are loud a lot. I think the second night I was here, they came in at 4:30 in the morning and woke me up banging around in the bathroom. Me and my roommate are quiet. Someone just got out of the shower and immediately got on the phone because someone called for her and was waiting to talk to her. I think it was Dani, but it may have been Amelia. I can't tell their voices apart yet. I think Amelia is the one with a job at Footlocker. My roommate is popping her knuckles. I pop mine a lot. I need to stop. Everyone says it makes your knuckles big when you get older. I don't think that's true because it is just releasing air from the joint. I just popped my knuckles out of habit. Someone just slammed a door again. Everyone always slams doors. Maybe they don't do it on purpose, but it is still really loud. I only have five minutes left. That's good because I think my roommate is done studying for the evening. Now she is typing on her computer and laughing. She must be IMing someone. It is probably her ex-boyfriend who lives in El Paso, or maybe it is her friend Louie that I met the other day. I wonder who's online that I can talk to right now. Probably no one. I need to go to bed anyway. I'm glad I gat my Calculus homework done. I got a 94 on it, so I'm pretty happy. That's good considering I didn't get any help on it. I need to find a study group for Calculus. I probably need them for all my classes. My roommate asked me if our suitemates are always going out. I said yes. They do go out a lot. I don't think I've ever seen them study. My friend said she hasn't seen her roommate study at all either. I wonder how they are going to pass their classes. I'm almost done. I only have 30 more seconds. Then I get to go to bed. Good night! "
Tell me about yourself.,"I just woke up but I'm still sleepy. naps are so great! especially when you are sick. I can't believe that I've been sick all week long. I can't believe I missed that much class. I hope it's ok. I should be. college isn't like high school. thank God. there is so much more free time here. but I need to spend some of it studying. I'm nervous about all of my first tests! I hope I can handle them. I mean, I made good grades in high school but that is nothing compared to this level. oh well. grades can't be everything. if they were, I'd end up like my roommate. oh God. I've never met anyone like her. ever. how can anyone possibly be so boring? wow, speaking of the devil she just walked in! that always happens to me! everytime I talk about or mention someone they either walk up or call me. it's rather creepy. anyway. eww! I just remembered that we have geckos in our dorm room! it's so gross! well. they are actually kind of cute, but just not in my room. I need to take it out from under that cup before it suffocates. I would hate to kill it. poor thing is probably scared to death. either that or REALLY bored, I mean it's been in that small prison for a day now. but then again, my roommate sits in our small prison for days & never gets bored. I'm so mean. but it is seriously driving me insane! I mean give me a break, I walk in and she is just sitting there. no lights, no music, no TV. just staring at the wall. how creepy. but she doesn't mind. I mean I try to get her come places with me but she is never interested. oh well. whatever floats her boat. but what does? it seems that nothing does. I mean I can tell you I like this song or I like this food. she has nothing that she likes. nothing that she is passionate about. I do like this song actually. I like weezer. its somewhat mellow but not enough to make me want to sleep. a good transition from taking a nap to waking up. its perfect for right now. lyrics: lets go away for a while, you & I, to a strange & misty land. "" I really need to take a trip to visit jeff, heather, & tim. I don't understand how all of my favorite people in the whole world all decide to disperse themselves across the nation just to go to school. I'm so jealous! heather gets to go to NYC just for the weekends! that is going to be awesome to go see her on thanksgiving. I really want to go see jeff in alabama too. I need to go watch one of his baseball games. he is so good! I am so proud of him! I'm sad that he isn't here though. I wish he was taller. I know if he was that he could definitely go pro. they say he has a chance even now! that is so great! that would be his dream come true. I hope he makes it. but I hope I still get to see him. I really miss him. I miss tim too. but what is in kentucky?  "
Tell me about yourself.,"Palms are sweaty, my stomach is uneasy, and my head just feels in pain. I'm sick, I'm not supposed to get sick. I'm pre-med"" I'm supposed to be taking good care, promoting health. I need to get better, it is essential that I get better. I need to concentrate on my studies. I sleep late because I cannot fall asleep due to late night fevers. I may not be feeling well, but my conscience follows me as well. Did I break up with Joseph for the right reasons?  Of course I did, he was over possessive, or maybe I just didn't understand him enough. Maybe, I didn't love him enough to understand. Did I love him at all?  Yes, I'm certain of it. He needed to understand that I needed to be trusted and understood. Three years, three years of my short life, all gone to waste. I feel incomplete. maybe I should go back with him, no I must resist. I know what I want, I cannot be defeated. I need to conquer what I have set out as my destiny. I need to be a doctor. I cannot be a failure. I need to find the cure. My sister is ill, my sister is laying on her death bed. My nephew, barely 2 yrs. old, he needs his mother. I need to work faster. I need to help her. I cannot let time defeat me. I need to find the cure, why does cancer have to be such a stubborn illness?! Does God, not understand, does he not know that my sister is the highlight of my life. If I could, if I were given the chance, I'd give my life for hers. I love her so much. I have two other sisters, but this one is my best friend. Who's going to be there for me. How come I'm not being there for her. I should have been there for her surgery, I was at school. Life sucks, yes it's proven. God is attempting to take my sister away, and at the same time he is trying to physically impair my father. You broke his legs. We are poor, I know it, but my parents are hard workers. My mother a housewife and my father a maintenance worker. They worker harder than most people who just take dimes as they come. Not even breaking a sweat, how dare you hurt my family. Do you plan on leaving me without family? Without love? I need to get better. I need to get rid of this sick. I need to keep on with my studies. I need to find the cure. I need to tend the needs of my family. I need to do this fast. I need to do something. What did I ever do you?  I donate to others. I help people. You don't help me. God, listen to me, I will not me defeated! I cannot be defeated. I cannot slow down. I need to achieve. Nobody in my family can ever be harmed. I don't believe that time takes charge of destiny. I can make my destiny. I know I can do something. I have to do something. What must I do?  What do I do? I'll make you a deal God, if you protect my family I will owe you my life. You can collect as soon as you help them. Help them please. I need you to help them. Don't do me any favors, do it for them. They have so much awaiting them. I have nothing. I give you my life in exchange for theirs. I will not be defeated. I will not be defeated. I will not be defeated. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I was just typing for like 3 minutes and all the stuff I just typed erased. So now I'm really pissed off. I was writing about my boyfriend and how I miss him and he just called and said he was going to call me back. I am so excited about this weekend cause all my friends in school will be down this weekend and we are going to go out and spend time together. I am so excited. I really don't like it up here I just have to deal with it and get used to it. I get so happy when I get to go home on the weekends. So you could say I am living for the weekends. That is bad I guess but I don't know, I just have to get used to it. I am talking to my friend right now. She is a good friend but sometimes she gets on my nerves cause she can be so fake sometimes. I wish she would just be herself all the time. I wish that some of my friends would come up here. I am ready to go home. I miss my family and especially my mother. She would comfort me right now. I need to read my bible. I am so bored right now. And I'm tired because I stayed up late last night to finish calculus and chemistry. I wish the professors would get together so that we wouldn't have so much homework. I am so bored. My friend is on the phone and she is talking to me lying again. I hate when she lies. She does that all the time. I wish she wouldn't do that. I wish my friend Kim would come up here and go to college with me. I have already made up my mind that if I don't like it by the end of the semester I am going to transfer. I will try to stick it out though. I have calculus homework due Thursday and I am going to have to get my cousin to come help me cause some of the problems I don't know how to do. My calculus teacher moves too fast and even he doesn't know what he did on some days. That is horrible. I can't wait till I get in my major because then my classes will be smaller and I will be able to understand stuff better. Dang!  I didn't know that twenty minutes lasts this long. I have like nine more minutes. I am so bored. As soon as I finish this I am going to sleep. No!  After I talk to my boyfriend. He is coming up here on the 19th and I can't wait. I haven't seen him in a while. I wonder what he is doing right now. My daddy gets on my nerves. He always has something smart to say. He can't never just let stuff be. I wish he wouldn't call sometime if all he is going to talk about is stupid stuff. I am really glad I have church members that care about me. I have received so many phone calls. It really encourages me to know that I have people praying for me. I have to keep reminding myself that I want to be a pharmacist and that I have to do what I have to do to get it. I am so wishing that my six years here would be fast and I will do good and that I won't fail any classes. I want to talk to my boyfriend now, but I am not going to call him until I finish this. Twenty minutes is long, and I didn't know it could be so long. I guess that is when you are wanting time to pass because If I didn't want time to pass it would be going by fast. I really miss my mother. I'm about to read my bible, so I can gain some encouragement. I think I may call my mother before I go to bed or not. I need to quit acting like a baby and start being the grown up that I am and accept my responsibility. I am about  to call my boyfriend. I love him and hope we get married right after I finish school, if we last that long. If not, I wish the best for him in life. But I think we would be good together. We are good together now. Except when we get mad at each other and then we are still good together. I can't wait till wee see him this weekend too. And my family. I'm ready to see everyone. I love being at home. I wish when I was in high school I didn't always want to leave home "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, I do not really know what I am thinking right know. Actually I think that I am a really slow typer and that I really need to read for all my classes, but I am just too tired to do that right now. My desk lamp is really bright and it hurts my eyes unless it is facing down. I am really excited about tonight because I am going to the Chi-O pledge retreat. I hope that it is fun because I do not really know any of the people in my pledge class and I want to get to know them all. I like all the decorations in my room that the actives put up for me. The red and yellow balloons are starting to look bad so I think I need to take them down now. I think that I will save them so that I can make a scrapbook later with all of the Chi-O things that I have acquired. I am really hungry right now. what do I want to eat?  I am tired of eating Mexican all the time which is really weird because I love Tex-Mex. Oh well, . I really think this is a weird assignment. I keep getting on weird subjects. I think that I need to get my nails done really bad, but I just do not know when I will find the time to do it. I should probably check on my laundry. I wonder what we will do tonight at the Chi-O house?  I am not looking forward to putting on a swimsuit. I need to find some dance classes to take so that I am doing something active and not just sitting on my butt all the time. I am really thirsty. I can't wait to go buy all the Tops pictures I took this weekend. I miss my sister and I think that I might go home on the weekend of the 20th. my ex-boyfriend's birthday is today!  I wish that I could see him. well. maybe I can finish the roll of film that I have so that I can get it developed before Ashley's B-day on wednesday I think. I hope that Kyle does not get to HH soon. oh well, my back is starting to hurt from sitting in this chair. I hope that my to heals well. I can not sit still . I really like the Chi-O things written all over my mirrors in red and yellow. my stomach is so hungry. I seem to have a bigger appetite now that I am in college. that is probably not a good thing. I really hope that I do not gain the freshman 15. um. I need to call my mom or just send her an e-mail with all my book costs on it so that she can call dad. it is about 5:30 and I have to be at the Chi-o house at 9:00. should I look cute?  I bet that some people will get dressed up, but I just really do not care. when is Kelly going to get back so we can go get food. I really like the posters that we finally received to day, which took forever to get here. They add character to the dorm room. I wonder who I am going to live with next year?  I hope that Ashley does not feel left out when she finds out that I am going to live with Lexi and Kelly next year and who knows who else. I mean she could always room with us I guess, but I think that she would not have as much fun because she never wants to go out with us she just stays home and studys, which is fine, but it just seems like she would do better somewhere else. I do not really care. I guess that can be left up to her. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I can't believe she did that. She is supposed to be my suitemate, and my friend. She knows that I like him, and I thought I could trust her with my secret thoughts on him. Why did she have to run off and tell him everything I've said in the past 3 weeks? What kind of friend is that? Did she think she was helping the situation? The question that I've been asking myself for the past few days is, how do you know when you can trust someone?        Why can't people mind their own business? In all of my years so far, growing up with gossiping girls hasn't always been easy, but I always knew how to keep a secret. If someone can't trust you with their secret, how do you expect to trust them with yours? There was this old saying my friends and I used to repeat in junior high, Secrets secrets are no fun, secrets are for everyone. Secrets secrets are no fun, unless you let me in on one!"" How true is that? I wish I could just take back everything I have said to her, knowing that she has run her mouth to the last person that needs to know my secrets. I can feel the tension between us building up slowly. When she asks me a question, I can hold back my answers because I still have some resentment towards her. Sometimes I even forget that I am supposed to be mad at her, and to make things worse, she doesn't know that I am mad at her. Mad isn't the correct word to describe my feelings; disappointed makes more sense. I met her through a mutual friend 2 years ago at a concert in Houston. I thought that would be the last time I would ever see her, and those 15 minutes of conversation with her are blurred now. When our mutual friend informed me that she was attending the same school as me, and living in the same dorm as me, I thought that we should be suitemates and try living together. At first, we hit it off surprisingly well, doing everything together. It was like we had been best friends since elementary school! We are even rushing the same sorority. Can anyone tell me they have been in my difficult situation before? Well if you have, please write a manual for me to read on how to deal with lying suitemates/friends that you thought you could trust. What bothers me the most is that she doesn't know that I know what she is been doing behind my back. Everytime I would make a comment about the guy I'm into, or hang out with him and come back to my room glowing, we would sit down and talk and gossip about it. Why didn't I see it coming? Why couldn't I have known that she would betray my trust and run along and tell that guy everything I have been gushing about? It doesn't make any sense to me, because I have higher expectations in a friend than that. I expect a friend to respect my secrets, my wishes, and my personal life that doesn't involve them. I guess it's partly my fault for not watching what I say around her, like talking about things that I wouldn't want to get back to him. I guess it's partly my fault also, for trusting in her too fast. My roommate has been very supportive of the whole thing. She told me to just watch what I say around her, and to not say anything that I wouldn't want ANYONE else to know. It just hurts my feelings that she would gain my trust and then knock it down quick to the start. Maybe I shouldn't be so open with people I barely know. Maybe I shouldn't feel guilty, because ultimately it was her screw-up. Right? "
Tell me about yourself.,"Today I had to wake up for an 8:00am class. I am so tired right now, but I'm not going to take a nap because I have a lot of things to do today. Last night was my roommates birthday. She had a meeting that she had to go to from 6-10pm, so we couldn't go out to dinner. Instead, when she got home, I had gotten a couple presents and she opened them. She started to cry, telling my that it was the first time anyone had ever celebrated her birthday. I find it so strange to find out about the different types of childhoods and life that all of my new friends here have experienced. Everyone comes from different backgrounds and the things that I might think are very common may actually be new things for some people. That is why I am enjoying living in the dorm right now and meeting all sorts of people. I love to study and figure out why people are the way they are and what makes them act the way they act. Anyway, my rhetoric class this morning wasn't too bad. Once I'm up and out of bed, I can usually get to class and do everything that I need to do. In my biology class, my teacher gave us a quiz. We hadn't been told about it and it was over a chapter that most people hadn't read yet. The quiz was worth 6 points and I got 3. Three points was about the average of the class. My professor isn't American and he doesn't articulate his words. This makes it very hard to understand and take notes. Luckily, I had a lab this afternoon and the TA was able to explain the lecture and help clarify so of the notes. Today, I am going to go to TOPS to get some of the pictures that I took this weekend. I am so excited because I don't have many pictures on my wall right now. My suitemate said that she would make me a bulletin board. She is very artistic and creative, so I know it will be really cute. Tonight, I have a meeting for my sorority. I chose to go Tri-Delt. I really like all the girls and we have been hanging out a lot. Everyone gets along pretty well, but there are always groups of people that tend to cling together. I have tried to make friends with as many of them as I can. Right now everyone is worrying about where they should live next year. It's kind of frustrating because it is so soon. How do we know who we will be friends with and hang out with in a year from now? I guess you just pick and hope for the best. My roommate and I decided to live together and both of us have been asked to live with other girls from our sororities. So, we decided to get an apartment together and we have 4 other girls that we have met that are going to live with us. I really hope we all get along and I'm sure everything will work out! "
Tell me about yourself.,"Gosh, I'm so tired right now. Crazy. and oh so overwhelmed with school. I mean how much reading could I possibly get this semester. I hate having vision problems. it just feels like everything is this world is working against me. I mean the blind people get all of their books on tape before me. well reality check. I CAN'T READ MY BOOKS EITHER. I guess I could make a big stink about it. because by law they have to arrange for me to get assistance for my disability. but its too much hassle and I already feel really uncomfortable about my disability. I mean. I just hope that if I transfer schools that they will give me more individualized assistance. something UT has no idea how to do. Why do I hate my roommate so much. I think I need therapy for how much I hate her. I actually get a pang in my stomach when I know she is at the apartment. that is a major problem. adn when I go into my apartment I close my bedroom door in order to say don't even try to talk to me"". and the really really sad thing is that I don't think she has a clue how much I hate her. I haven't had this much rage towards someone since 11th grade. and those are the only two people in my whole entire life that I have ever hated. Staci and my spanish teacher . Its weird some people just rub me the wrong way and there is  no forgiving them. I get along with everyone. I mean everyone. so for me to have an enemy it is actually quite odd. I wonder why dan and vab always have to act like they are cool and don't care about stuff. It actually really bothers me. I mean, for God's sake, show some freaking emotion. Its so ridiculous. ummm have I mentioned how tired I am?  my eyes are closing on me. I really need to get more sleep in the future. I wonder if I really should transfer schools. I mean. that would mean moving back into my parents house. that would mean I can't come home drunk. I can't bring guys back to just hang out. gosh. all the fun stuff I do here would have to end. but then you just weigh that against my future. I mean I think if I got more assistance for my disability, I would go farther in life. which obviously is my ultimate goal. No one even knows I can't see well. I hide it so well,. I've known people for 3 years and they still don't know. I mean. they'll make fun of my vision but they never put 2 and 2 together. I wonder if I would if I was in there position?          oh my gosh. I'm soooooooo tired. now my eyes are burning. is this a sick joke?  I still have like 8 minutes to go. I don't know if I'm going to make it. my money situation is horrible. I seriously spend too much money on alcohol. I mean I spend so much freaking time studying during the week, that I feel like I  DESERVE to go out on the weekends. ya know. so I just spend my money on that. so why isn't it raining outside?  It was raining so magnificently last night. I love it when it pours rain. I reminds me of my dad. We always would go outside on our patio when it would thunder and lightning and just watch it. It was always so amusing to me and my sister and I would always have father-daughter bonding time. I miss my dad. why does he have to live in Egypt anyways. What a joke. my family does not deserve that one bit. Thank God he has a good and secure job though. otherwise I would be at a community college instead of UT right now. only 4 minutes to go. ummm. yep. once again I am tired. I got invited to a party tonight. I kinda don't want to invite dan. cause he always acts like he is too cool. when in all reality I'm too cool for him. so he feels like he has to act that way in order to compensate. Why is Suneal GAY. He is such the perfect guy for me. that royally sucks. Aren't there any straight wonderful gentlemen still left in this world of ours. I sure haven't found them. /. oh my!  1 minute. yippee        honestly that was a very excruciatingly long 20 minutes. I think you could have gotten the stream of consciousness point across by making it 10 minutes. but whatever        times up. oh darn!        peace out         "
Tell me about yourself.,"It is really really very very cold in my room. I do not know why they keep it so very cold in the dorm rooms. it is also cold in the dining hall. I am forced to wear my hoodie and always have a blanket on. I am glad I brought two blankets. sitting like this on my chair my foot is falling asleep. the chair is not so comfortable as a whole. josh has one of those big black comfy desk chairs that professional type people have it is the coolest thing ever. too bad he is a jerk eh. owww I just hit my knee on the stupid desk thing. I wish my roommate would come home she was supposed to be here like two hours ago. we are going out tonight which is good because all I have been doing the last couple days is studying which is necessary but it isn't all that fun. I need to borrow duct tape so I can tape up the cords on the desk because they are ugly-looking. we were supposed to go to target sometime also, to buy a rug for the floor because the floor in this room is COLD. some of the classes on this campus are very far away from my dorm room. maybe I should figure out the whole bus system so I can take a bus down to them. although walking is good exercise and I do need exercise. you would think with an exercise room downstairs I would go down there and use it. maybe if my roommate does not come back by the time I am done this I will go work out for awhile. but then I will have to take another shower. don't know if it is worth that. because then I will also have to dry my hair and I hate hair dryers. they are evil things. whoever decided that girls need to dry their hair in order to look good was an evil person. they never should have been invented. same with makeup. we should all just be completely natural. if somebody really, truly, likes you, they will like you all the same with no makeup on. at least that is my philosophy and I am sticking to it because I hate putting makeup on. it's a pain. a waste of time, if  you will. the cd stopped. I should put another one on. now I'm going to have 'yo's a ho' stuck in my head. it's not a bad song just not a song I would like to have stuck in my head. I always wake up in the morning with some random song stuck in my head. it's weird. I don't know where they come from. last night I had a dream that I was yelling at erin. in someone's driveway- until she walked out on the street. I am unsure of what we were yelling about but I don't think it would be that hard to get us to be yelling at each other. it's really weird how easily one of your friends can turn hostile on you. I have an itch on my leg. it's itchy. my hands are cold from typing, and because they are exposed to the cold that is my room. too bad there isn't a thermostat type dealy in this room like some of the other dorm buildings have. I wish I were staying in blanton I would like to be able to go to the lobby and hang out whenever I felt like it like people do there all the time. the only time people around here hang out is just when they are studying. I guess I could go knock on some random people's doors and watch tv with them or something. meh. I can't believe lela's dorm has a curfew. that's crazy. at first I thought she was talking about visiting hours, because we have visiting hours at eleven thirty sunday through thursday, but she was actually talking about a curfew. they have to be in the building by eleven. I guess they know who is in by who swipes their card. that is like big brother or something. 1984. I don't like it. I mean, these people are all almost 18 years old. and they are Church of Christ - going people. if they stay out past eleven or twelve, they are most likely not going to do something bad. and if they do, I think that is their problem. not the dorms'. I definitely could not live like that. I don't even like visiting hours. my hands are still cold. half the point of going to college is having more freedom. if I only wanted to take classes I would stay at home and live with my parents. but I wanted more freedom (and also to meet new people and have fun) so I guess that is what I have to do. it's a shame I am terrible at meeting new people. and they are bad at meeting me. it doesn't help that my psychology class has 550 + people in it. it's a bit insane when you have a class that is only 30 people short of your graduating class. and they all fit in one room. our class couldn't fit in one room for the longest time, until they built the new auditorium. my brother's class has a thousand in it, but they are really bad so I wonder how many they will have when he graduates. BRRRR my hands are cold. the cushion thing on the chair keeps sliding around and it is really quiet in here. I need to talk to my suitemates more. they seem nice but we don't ever talk to them it's really a shame. I need to clean the water filter pitcher so I can drink some water. water is good stuff. josh says some girl he knows drinks 3 glasses of coffee a day. I don't drink any caffeine. I did one day and I was jittery and nervous and bouncing off the walls and stuff. it was not enjoyable. my mom drinks coffee everyday. I don't understand why people think they need it. is it psychological? or do they really need it to wake up?  on tv people always say lets go get coffee"" or ""we need some coffee"" and it's always after some traumatic event or really late at night. I think that drinking coffee then would make things worse. what you would need is some sleep, and caffeine would not help sleep. it would keep you awake. at least it keeps me awake. I guess some people can sleep even though they have caffeine in them? I wonder why andy called this morning. I called him back twice and he didn't answer either time. weird. people are weird. all of them. especially james. with his bald head. it does not make any sense to me why he took a year off from the core. he seemed to have loved it and his excuse of ""I am a. d. d. "" doesn't really make all that much sense. because. the core is so disciplined. I would think it would be good for a person who had a. d. d. I wonder if there is a another period if you end a sentence with an abbreviated word. that would look really funny. like 2/3 of a "". ""  well I am going to end this the way I started it. it is really really very very cold in here. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Wow, my mind goes blank when someone asks me what I'm thinking. It's really strange that that guy just stopped by. He is really friendly, but kind of creepy. He just comes in and talks to everybody. It's ok, I'm the same way; I'll sit and talk to anyone. Maybe I should close the door, so I won't get distracted; but then Garrett won't see that I'm here when he gets back. Oh well, he can knock. I'm so tired, but I don't think I can sleep tonight. It's so loud in our hall at night; I'll just have to start taking naps during the day when everyone is in class. Yeah right, rest?  I'm always in class; or studying. I spend more time studying than I spend in class; seems backwards. I can't wait until this weekend. Need to ask professor about ahhhh Namo's calling. Need to go to admissions office and claim CTC credit and change major. Need to ask Pennebaker about experiments. Hope Namo stops by, I'm kinda bored. This weekend will be fun; I haven't seen friends from home in a couple of weeks, so it'll be good to hang out with them. But what about Keith?  I don't know how he is going to act now that we broke up. Should I tell him about Matt?  Who cares?  I should call Uncle David about kayaking; he really wants to go, and it will be a good stress reliever. Hope I have time; good memory. I think Matt would really like it too. I don't really want to go home, haven't been gone long enough. Why wasn't anyone in the comp lab earlier to help me. Now I'll have to go again tomorrow. It's ok, tomorrow's easy. Can't wait to swim laps again; it's a good workout. I should keep lifting weights. I don't want to lose any more weight, but it would be nice to gain some muscle; I'll keep lifting weights. Oh, have to meet Jen tomorrow for Cru. She is nice, I just don't know if I'll have time to meet in the small group regularly. That's terrible, I should never pick other things over Bible study. But I pray, and I should study on my own. I hope Annah starts going to church with me. Texas eleven? Are they still in New Mexico?  Is that where they went? I don't think so. Wow, this feels like when I'm working out and waiting for the twenty minutes to be up. I keep looking and the clock. Maybe I should put on some socks; these floors are really cold, and I think they're pretty dirty too. Yuck, who else has been barefoot here?  Where's Sarah, haven't seen her today. Where's my roommate?  She is always here. It's ok, this is nice. I need to go to the eye doctor, because I'm having trouble focusing. Glasses would be such a pain; I hope my vision gets better on its own. Will I have time to take Spanish every semester of college?  I hope so; it would be nice to be fluent. Very useful also if I work in Texas. I have to stay in Texas; it's too cold everywhere else. I love Texas anyway. Austin too. It's so great to finally live here. And home isn't too far away. I'm not homesick yet. I just want my own bed. Jester beds suck. I have to be exhausted to get comfortable in them. I hope Jenny takes me out again soon. I had lots of fun with her. I need to spend time with Kim too. I'm so glad we've been friends for so long. Even when we don't talk for a long time, she is always there. My eyes are tired. What's on tv?  Absolutely nothing interesting. Where's Matt?  Maybe I'll call him. No, he is with a friend. He will call later. So many books, where to start?  Probably Spanish, I have that first. I need to stop eating so much candy. It's bad for my teeth and my body. Look, time's almost up. Yep, they're in New Mexico, but only ten left. What's the point?  Who cares?  Does anybody pay attention anymore?  Did I ever?  Not me! "
Tell me about yourself.,"today all I think about is snow skiing, I cannot wait to be in the mountains, its so liberating and right now I feel so tied down and constricted, my room is annoying me at the moment because I do not like my desk space, it is uncomfortable so I find it hard to work in, which makes me not want to do anything at my desk. right now I feel so lost in life, there are so many things that I want to do and I know I have all the time in the world, but I feel like everything is moving so fast, especially now that my best friend is back at school, I feel we just started summer together yesterday and now he and I both are gone and back our separate ways, which is for the best, but at times it is so hard because I feel like a whole sector of my life is missing and I spend most of my days thinking about it and how it really is not that long until we see each other again and I look forward to the coming years but I get scared because I wonder if my future involves him. we have many of the same passions and we desire to do the same things, but I wonder if we will do them together or own way. I constantly think about my future but not really the success aspect, but rather the things that I want to do the things that make me happy, which for awhile would not include a job. I guess I don't really think about growing up that much but really like I said earlier that all I think about is going skiing this winter, I feel like the mountains are my home, like that is where I belong and I am itching to get back, because I have not been in so long. when people ask where my favorite place to be is, it is definitely the mountains. its like this little place god created where I can get away and forget about everything that drags me down, and just allow me to stand in awe and take in all that this earth has to offer, its like it releases me. not only that I love skiing it is my favorite form of exercise, and its just all I can think about considering how hot it is here and I cannot wait to get away the heat and get where the air knocks you off you feet. "
Tell me about yourself.,"its raining outside and it has been for quite a while, I can't believe I stayed out late when I had to get up at 5 in the mourn for army rotc that was stupid bc I sleep through it like an idiot and I sleep through my 1 oclock class for govt. man I can't believe I did that but what am I going to do about it now why do I do this all the time I ve been really good at doing shit lately, because I have to for a rotc but dammit why did I sleep through today, well I'm probably going to have to pay for it tomorrow I'm just disappointed in myself and I let my squard leaders down and that is who I went out with last night which does not make it any easier man I got to piss hold on, well I got to go work out today sometime to make up for missing this morning damn that really pissis me off, I wish I could just go back in time to 5 am, and get my lazy ass out of bed, we got a game tomorrow against Arkansas I hope we kick thre ass, then I'm going over to an arotc ranger party to watch the fight between del la joya and mosler I think, I can't wait but now that I missed the pt this mourn I don't really want to be there with all of my leaders bc they now I missed this mourn man I would pay a 100 bucks to go back in time, I really wanted to see what I was going to score on the pt test, I mean I know I wasn't go to score very good, bc they smoked our asses the days before but still I wanted to do it. oh I so don't want to study today but I know that I'm going to have to, I have not done any readings for psy and govt and I really need to, yeah I'm going to go run and work out then, ill do some reading and shitoh man the 20 minutes is almost up, I shouldn't complain to much about it, its a lot easier than some of the other hw my classes give me "
Tell me about yourself.,"A picture of my girlfriend Bri sits on top of my desk to the left of my computer. She is beautiful in many ways. Her eyes look a little odd in this particular picture, however. I'll tell her that next time I talk to her. My cousin Brandon is getting married in October. He is been living with his girlfriend for quite a while. When I asked him how he felt about getting married, he told me that things would be much different since he is been living with his girlfriend. It should be much different though because now he would have taken vows and promised himself to her and vice versa. It'll be awesome. The wedding will be a lot of fun. I'll dance with Bri and such. And I'll have all my family there. Well, a lot of my family because it's impossible to unite all of my family. Too big. 44 first cousins, etc. I remember when my sister got married. Good times. I got to wear an awesome sleek-looking tux. My uncle (Brandon's dad) took a cool digital picture. My feet are cold. I'm not gunna put on a second pair of socks though, because I don't want to wash an extra pair of socks. David, my roommate is playing guitar. He is playing a solo that we recorded on Trey Davis' recording. We recorded and collaborated with Trey. Good times. I hope he is happy with it. I'll ask him next time I'm in Lake Jackson. Bri is wonderful. I can't wait to see her next month. I hope all the flight arrangements work out and such. It should. And then I'll be able to embrace her like I did this past summer. What an amazing summer, all because I loved her like I should. Honestly, faithfully, humbly, with integrity and with all my soul. We're awesome because we reciprocate each other without having to put effort into it. Everything is willing. Everyday I see so many people in horrible relationships or pathetic relationships. But Bri and I are so far past that. And we both know it. And we both appreciate it and don't take it for granted. I love her. I'm proud of that because I know I love better than most if you even call what most do love. David and I are working on a new song. It's going to rock. David, you're distracting me. Half over. 1:19 am. I need to read, but I'll do that tomorrow. He is still playing the guitar. He is asking me musical questions but I am busy. Stream of Consciousness! Yay. Homework. Yahoo for school. Yahoo for me. *shrugs*"" - billy madison. Great movie. I have it memorized and I recited it in front of Rommy in 7th grade when he challenged that I couldn't recite it. Good times. I wonder how Rommy's doing. He is probably smoking or drinking right now. What an admirable class president. Dustin was student body president. good guy. I'll see him on american idol one of these days. My neck itches and I scratched it. My calves are cold now. *stretching calves*  mmm. cow. Reminds me of steak. Yum. I could eat a juicy steak right about now. *drools*  ""Mmmm. homemade prosac. mmm. organized crime"" - homer simpson. It would be hilarious and awesome to be a vigilante, that is, if I wouldn't feel bad about hurting people for my own reasons rather than society's ethics or their own morals. But if I were a local vigilante, I'd hang out on Speedway in the middle of the bicyle-dismount-zone and I'd push over all the people who passed by me still on their bikes. ""Bicycle dismount zone, punk!"" heh. That's be cool. Then they would get up and beat me up. I remember when I use to spend the night at Scott's house back in 6th,7th grade and in the morning his dad would bring us donuts sometimes because he worked night shifts. but sometimes we would eat cereal. I never eat breakfast anymore. and his bowls would have straws built-into them and you could suck the milk when you were done. that was the first time I saw one of those. they were  "
Tell me about yourself.,"Okay so I'm sitting here in my dorm room and looking out the window and I see trees and squirrels and birds. I really like my dorm because when I walk outside to go to class. I always see so many squirrels and they come right up to you and they always are carrying nuts and okay maybe I should stop talking about the squirrels but they really are cute. I'm trying to think what I've done today because I feel like I'm wasting the day away. I woke up at about 12:30 and went up to my friends dorm room and got her and her roommate out of bed. We all went to Subway obviously because we were hungry and sat there for like 30 minutes. I came back to my dorm and my roommate is very consistent about getting on my nerves. Her boyfriend broke up with her 2 days ago and she definitely isn't being the sweetest person. She is rather annoying and whenever my ex boyfriend calls me, she freaks out. I think she is jealous. but what is there to be jealous of? It's not like I have a wonderful boyfriend. My ex boyfriend. Travis. he goes to UTSA because he didn't get into UT. He will be here in a year. Well. he broke up with me before we went to college for unknown reasons and was a total jerk. I feel like such a prissy girl talking about my boy problems. Hmmm. well basically he (Travis) came crawling back and is begging for me to get back together with him. We were together for almost 2 years. Well I told him we might be able to get back together but really I have no intentions of getting back together with him until he gets to UT and by then hopefully I will have either found another guy or completely gotten over him. I love him still and it frustrates me. College frustrates me right now. I always had a lot of work in high school so I am used to the work load but I am just boggled down with things to do. Like laundry. And sorority crap that is pointless. We had some pledge retreat to go to this weekend and I skipped out on it. I feel guilty"" but then I don't. I didn't see the point in spending the night at the Chi-O house and sleeping on the floor in a room with 51 other girls when my mother pays a lot of money for me to have a comfortable bed at Scottish Rite. I don't think the sorority girls will buy my reasoning what so ever. OH well. what can I do? Nothing. I miss my friends. HMMMMM. I never thought I would miss my ex boyfriend this much but he was my best friend for a long time and it would be nice if he was here so I could escape from all the petty college stuff. like frat parties where the boys are only looking for one thing or the binge drinking (seems like everyone here is obsessed with getting ""wasted"". It's like the girls in my dorm (which is an all girls dorm) have never tasted a sip of alcohol in their entire teenage lives and now that they've experienced ""Frat Parties"" they can't get enough. Don't get me wrong. I love partying and the occasional wild nights but then I also believe that frat parties get old. On a different topic. I have a bunch of homework to do. At least I'm getting this done and I'm enjoying it at the moment. It's very relaxing. typing whatever I want. Not having a strict curriculum to follow. I wish I could meet some guys that aren't just interested in sex. That grosses me out. Look. my thoughts are running rampant. But then I also miss things with Travis. But then I don't miss Travis because I'm in Austin. doing whatever I want. in the heart of the city, but then I stayed home last night . a Saturday night and I was in bed. I guess I'm some sort of loser. I almost feel like if I don't party every single night I am like the biggest LOSER UT has ever seen. I need to separate myself from all this Greek B. S. Hmmm. you know what else I need to do. laundry. read Pyschology. Calculus Homework. That's another thing that worries me. The difficulty of my Calculus class. I have already found a tutor and I'm having mass problems with the homework. Oh well. I'll get through it somehow right? I have tutoring tonight at 6. Isn't this little story of my life so interesting. I need like 4 boyfriends at one time like my friend Kim or like 20 activities to do at one time like my friend Geoff. No I really don't need to deal with that stuff actually. I have problems enough worrying about what I should eat in my dorm buffet style dining room or what colors go in what washer for laundry or how much time my Calculus homework will take me (probably 3 hours). WONDERFUL. So much to look forward to. so little time. I need to relax. I need a back massage. I need my mom's cooking and my own bathroom. I won't be getting those things for a long LOOONG time. I have no plans on going home. If I go home my curfew will be midnight. Funny how the parties in Austin don't actually start till midnight. Oh another thing. I hope I make good grades to make my mom happy. She seriously is worried about me and my grades. She probably thinks I'm partying so much which is not the case at all. I think I actually am in my dorm too much. Wait. she is going to get mad because I went shopping and used her credit card. OH LORD. I'll be getting a call in a couple weeks. ""LINDSEY. what is this ARDEN B store on my credit card bill? AND why did you spend [ ] amount of money there and why do u need those clothes anyways?"" Oh no. Well I have been doing this for 19 min and 11 seconds and it went by pretty fast. And I'm sure whoever reads this will be like ""what is this girl talking about?"" but that's okay because I'm sure there's a lot of those in the big pile of writing assignment #1's. Well my 20 min are up and I am closing this lovely ""stream of consciousness"" with my favorite quote just to add a magic touch. ?You will make all kinds of mistakes but as long as you are generous and true and also fierce you will not hurt the world or even seriously distress her. She was made to be wooed and won by youth. ?    ~Winston Churchill "
Tell me about yourself.,"I don't really know what I want to write about. I am about to start watching football. I used to like pro football a lot more, but now I really just don't care. I would much rather watch college that pro. I am downloading some music right now. I am ready for this paper to be done so that I can go and watch some football. I hope that this class isn't too hard. I don't want to really have to work really hard in this class since it is not really for my major. When I was walking to class today I was kinda regretting not dropping this class and signing up for something easier. But it will be ok, I'm just going to have to study. The other reason that I don't like that class is that I don't know anyone so everyday I come in a couple minutes before class starts and I sit down. And the only talking that I do is small-talk with someone that I don't know. That gets old after awhile, saying the same thing over and over again. IT's always what classes are you in and how's school going and where are you staying and where are you from and that kind of thing. It just gets really old. 20 minutes takes a long time when you are watching the clock. I am ready for the weekend to start. Football weekends are the best. This weekends tailgate is going to be a blast. There are going to trash arkansas fan walking by and yelling. This is getting old, because I'm am running out of ideas and my annoying roommate is making fun of me and I am about to fight him. He keeps on laughing at me and I don't like it. Here's my other roommate he is looking over my shoulder. He is not as much of a prick as the other one. I don't want to fight him right now. HE just walked out of the room. My other suitemate hasn't walked in yet. He probably won't. He is pretty weird. He sits in his room and plays video games most of the day. Other than that he just spaces out and watched tv. He doesn't party either. I feel sorry for him sometimes cause he mostly just sits in the room by himself when we are out doing stuff. I think he knows one person up here. But they don't really go out and that is no fun because I know that he is not having a good time up here. But maybe this is just the normal thing for him. He doesn't seem like he was a real social person in high school. I only have 4 minutes of typing left here so then I will be done and be happy. I'm listening to some new austin music right now. This paper is almost done, so I am happy. My friend just told me that his dad drinks o'douls, that would not be fun. My dad drinks real beer. Now my paper is done. "
Tell me about yourself.,"well as I was clicking on the button that allows you to begin, I noticed that I forgot the last digit of my social security number, aka, ut eid. well for whoever care, it is 7. my I'd number is 449712047. there now I can get credit for this assignment. anyway, I don't know what to write about. I'm sure that after a while your stream of consciousness"" I totally spelled that wrong, will take over. I bet everyone writes this at the beginning of their assignment just because they don't know what else to write about and aren't bored enough to be honest yet. so I am really mad about my laptop. last night is just turned white and shut down. I tried turning it on this morning and it wouldn't so I took it to the its  or something like that. it is the place where they are supposed to fix your computer. well they didn't. nope they just gave ma 1 8oo number to call which took me 20 minutes and I still didn't talk to a real person. I always type didn't instead of didn't. that is annoying. so I took the battery out of my computer and it works now but I still need a new battery which better be under warranty because I just got the thing in may. so I go to check my e mail and what do you know, I have another freaking virus on my computer. I am about to scream. seriously, I am using my roommates computer right now. it is the second one since I got here in june and it is pissing me off. I mean  I am not even one of those internet surfing kids, I just use it for research and e mail and papers and stuff so I don't even know how I got the dang thing. so now I have decided to type with the correct hand position so my typing is considerably slower and my spelling considerably poorer. ya screw this. I wish I would have paid attention in keyboarding class. man, I am only half way done. so this is my roommate's computer. she is sleeping right now. don't get me wrong, I love the girl to death but she is freaking emotional. it was her and her boyfriends 1 year anniversary today. I don't think he is good for her. my arm is starting to hurt. I know why it is because here in jester you have no freaking desk space and the fridge is shoved into your back. in kinsolving it was heaven. I miss it there a lot better community. my professor was talking about freshman insecurity or whatever today. he was right. I don't consider myself to be an insecure person but college will do it to ya, especially when you don't know anyone. I bet there are people like me who can just sit here and type crap, never letting on to what they are really thinking about. I obviously already have a little, but to tell you the truth, I am really thinking about how bad I am at typing. I don't know why I think I have to type fast for this. it isn't like you are counting my words. actually, it is just making it harder for me to continue my bullshit, excuse the French. why do people say that?  I think my dog back home is depressed. I know she misses me, I'm the only one she liked. she is always at my neighbor's house because they let her in and feed her. the sad thing is, I think my neighbor is trying to replace her husband with my odg. they just got divorced, one of the super religious couples you would never expect to. she is such a softie anyway. ya I def think that she is using my dog for company. I don't know why though because she already has two dogs of her own. ok well I have this meeting to go to tonight. it is for the lassos, no wait, the lonestars. I can't forget to call my friend lindsay or is it lindsey so we can meet to walk there. ya I am about to nope, I just did sneeze. God bless me. I think everyone should believe in God. he is great  even if there is no proof, that is where faith comes in right?  right. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am sitting here with my feet on my subwoofer. I should be reading psychology, my webcam isn't on right now. Jars of Clay is a good band. I don't really have much to write. Maybe I should go to the sophomore versus freshmen football game at Clark's Field right now, but I'm doing this instead. Justin Shih just IMed me. Justin told me to go play football because this assignment isn't due until the 12th and today is the 6th. I think I'm scared about falling behind in college. I've done all my calculus HW the day they came out. I never was this diligent in high school. I have nasty cough, it's been like this for a few weeks now. I hope it gets better. Two of my best friends are in Houston, I don't really have much to do without them here. I'm hungry, haven't eaten breakfast or lunch. God is bigger than the air I breathe, the world we'll leave. This is a song by Delirious?, a band from the UK. I slept in this dorm last night by myself the first time. I miss my parents and my brother. My brother is working in California, and for the first time I feel how much everything has changed. I miss my parents, they have done so much for me. I want to do well in college so that their money doesn't go to waste. I love you mom, dad. I feel a little sad that I can't see my parents whenever I want now. I can't eat dinner every night with them like I used to last year. My neck hurts. I wish I was playing warcraft III right now. I don't understand this assignment. Maybe further on in the course it'll make more sense but right now this makes none to me. These thoughts are not at all coherent. I hope I do okay on my economics quiz on monday. My poker book and chips still haven't arrived yet. I ordered them last week too. I wish people would send me care packages. My roommate just received a birthday present/care package from his girlfriend. I wish I had someone who would send me things. I've written a lot. I wonder if all the papers turned in are this long. This must suck for the TA to read. 400 students turning in non-sensical and incoherent papers. There's that cough again. I wish I could control it. My hands are tired from typing constantly. This assignment sure is long, 10 more minutes to go. I hope I get an A in psychology. if I beg for an A in this paper I wonder if it'll help. Just 9 more minutes to go. I can't think of anything else to write. Maybe this music is throwing off my concentration. Jars of Clay is now playing. they're a good band. Didn't I write about them earlier? Oh well. People don't call me, I wish someone calls me. I'm tired, I could use a nap although I woke up at 1:30 today. I wonder what Michael, one of my best friends, is doing. I should go to his room after this. Just 7 more minutes. I can't wait until this thing is over. Time sure goes by slowly when you're counting it down. I need to go to sleep early tonight, got to wake up early tomorrow. EV Free church is good. I need to check out Austin Chinese Church too though, to see how each compares to each other. I need to do my quiet time today, before I forget. Sometimes I feel like such an inadequate Christian, I have so many failures. I guess no one is perfect. I wonder what my brother's doing right now. It's 1 o'clock or so in California. I wonder if he likes it there. I wonder if I really like it in Austin. or if it's just an illusion. I think I like it here. I have friends, I think, things to do. I don't know. It's all so confusing. Sometimes I just want to hermit and not have social contact at all. I like to live in a big city such as New York because it's busy, but yet I don't' like loitering in big crowds or hanging around large groups of people. I wonder if that's weird, or maybe I just feel inadequate around large groups of people who I don't know. Like last night at CBS I didn't know a lot of people and I drifted from group to group loitering but did not feel like I belonged. Just 3 more minutes left to go in this assignment. It cannot go by any slower. I should go eat something after this. But then dinner is coming up soon. I hope I have time to get some more studying done this afternoon, or maybe tonight. I wonder if this is the longest paper turned in. probably not, there're some girls who can write nonstop. They probably double the length of what I wrote. I wonder if I am even doing this assignment correctly, I don't know how to track my thoughts or feelings, it's like I'm writing in a journal. Oh well. I can't be penalized for trying. just 30 more seconds to go. let's count it down    30    29    28    27    26    25    24    23    22    21    20    19    18    17    16    15    14    13    12    10    9    8    7    6    5    4    3    2    1    done "
Tell me about yourself.,"Ok well I have been putting this off for a while, but now I'm sitting down to do it. Just to let you know I'm really bad with punctuation and spelling and capitalization when I'm typing on the computer. its good in word because it corrects your spelling and capitals and grammar for you, friends is on the tv in the background right now, that show has been on for a long time. I'm really kinda stressed right now, I feel like I'm really behind in my classes and reading and homework. it would be good to have like a full free day or two. I guess that is what the weekend is, but this weekend I'm going home, my parents are really excited that I'm going. I have to get my acr fixed because I ran into a tire on the road the other day and it screwed up the bumper. I never understood that, who is the guy driving around with no tire? I really really don't understand that. things are a little weird right now, my roomie's going through some rough times and I'm trying to be there for her, I really hope I can be all shse needs. and than my boyfriend is like 600 miles away up in arkansas and I miss him like crazy. I wish he was here sometimes, but it seems like we'll really enjoy the time we have together now that its limited. he is a great guy and I miss him so much. anyways I'm not really sure what to write about now, my classes are ok, but I feel bogged down with work right now, I don't want to feel like I'm complaining about it. I also am a really bad typer. I never took that class in grade school where they teach you the home row and stuff and so I have to look at my fingers a lot. , really, I shouldn't blame it on not having the class, I could have learned on my own, but I didn't, oh well, I'm making it. but I'm not correcting my spelling and typos very much right now, but I notice that as I type my typing is getting better and faster and I have to look less and less at the keys because I'm getting more and more used to it as I sit here. college seems weird to me. so many people, so many changes. my roommate and one of my suitemates are both friends from high school which is awesome, they're great but its been hard for all of us to get out and meet people because ww hang out together a lot so that we don't have to put ourselves in uncomfortable situations and deal with new people. but I talked to some really nice kids today. things are good, I don't know if I should go home or not this weekend but my parents really want to see me and its just a drive to houston which is not very bad so I'm going to go, I'm looking forward to seeing my brother too, he is a freshman this year. soooooooooooooo anyways I don't know what to talk about. seinfeld is on tv now, I really like that show, funny, lighthearted, and you never have to know anything from the previous episode to catch the new one, I really like that because then I don't have to be committed to watching every night. all my books are on my bed right now and this writing assignment is not due for two days but I'm doing it now, even though I have assignments due in the morning, I think I'm just putting those off and instead I'm doing this because it seems a little more enjoyable than doing calculus problems or something like that, or reading, ugh I hate the reading. I'm not a good reader I don't think, I'm horrible at reading comprehension, at least that is what the standardized tests say. but anyways I'm a slow reader, I think, ok only 30 pages. but then 30 pages take me like an hour and 15 minutes. no small ordeal. wow I can't believe I have written this much I'm only 14 minutes, I have no idea what I'm going to write about for 6 more minutes. blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah I wonder what happens if you push the finish button before the time is up, I don't want to try but I bet someone does. someone who just wants to get out of whatever they can. maybe someone will tell me sometime. yay one of my suitemates just came home, she is on the phone, she is really cool. she just asked what I was doing, I tried to tell her and write at the same time, I didn't do very well, my fingers didn't press the right keys, hard to do two things at once, I'm not one of those people who can like talk on the phone and clean or mess with the computer at the same time, I need to focus on talking on the phone or something else. not both, that is probably because I don't want to let the other people think that I'm not paying attention to them, ah I just got distracted for like 10 seconds. yipe. so anyways, well my timing is going down I only have two more minutes left and now I feel like I need a break but I don't have time for breaks, I think I'll make some coffee and stay up late and get stuff done. yay only one more minute. my room is messy right now too. I don't really mind it if its my mess though, oh well, ill clean it up soon, I am soooooo excited that this is almost over! it was a lot harder just to write than I thought. wow "
Tell me about yourself.,"I just don't understand why things didn't work out. How can you honestly be so mean. I thought that you loved me. I loved you. I still love you. What went wrong?  I can't remember what went wrong last semester, but I am sure you would remind me if you had to. Gaw this song by John Mayer reminds me of you. Our love was so comfortable, so broken in. ""  Why did my parents disapprove of you and us?  Are you really that bad?  Are you really not that good for me?  I thought I could trust my own emotions. Why don't my parents trust me?  Or is it even a trust issue. Can I really not love at such a young age?  Ug. So many questions running through my mind. Why are you all I think about?  Wow, I wonder if this is obsessive. How do you even spell that darn word. Haha. Why do I always think in question form. Man, I want to go see you so bad. I really think I am coming for your birthday. But am I going to regret it?  Gaww, everyone tells me not to go. But they should take their own advise sometimes. I mean they don't even think the Bible is real. Sometimes I feel like I am the only one who believes in God. How can I trust my friends advice when they don't even believe the same thing I do!  If only I knew what God wanted for me. Talk about a stressful time. I never knew college would be so difficult. Academically I figured it would be but emotionally. Wow. Its incredible how much I have already changed. For the better?  I hope. I think I have though. I just wish I had you back Robert. I wish things could be like they used to. Why did you even call and apologize for everything you did wrong?  I know you still love me. Why do you even want me to come see you?  Do you want to be back with me?  I know you don't. Or do you ? You have fun being single. Why can't I?  Why can't I meet someone else to take my mind off of you. Are you the one?  Man, should I even be thinking like this at 20?  Ha. Maybe I am weird. Oh well. This song is extremely depressing. I am glad my roommates aren't here or they would be making fun of me for listening to it. Get over Robert Kimberly! Get over him!  If only  they knew I am trying, so hard. Gosh, its not like I have not prayed every night for Gods help. I mean geeze. I don't think he is suppose to be out of my life. But then if he is not, why was he so mean to me. I would have never done that to him. Never hurt him for anything. I guess I am a door mat. Its not that I let people walk all over me, its just that I don't ever want anyone to feel what I have. Why would I ever let anyone hurt on purpose?  If I had to choose between myself experiencing hurt and someone else, I would take the hurt in a second. I hate seeing people suffer. I will suffer before anyone I love does. So does that make me a door mat. Am I really too forgiving?  People can change. Or is that my fantasy world. I want to be with you Robert. So why can't I?  Because of my parents?  Yeah right. I can make my own decisions. Gaw, am I really that immature too?  No!  I am very mature for my age. He was always there for me when I needed him the most. He was my shoulder to cry on. Yeah last year was tough and I may have been to needy and dependent on him. But the break up made me realize that and now I am not as dependent. I am fine without him and I realized I have to  make myself happy. So why does not he want to be with me now?  Does he?  He calls me all the time. Tells me he loves me and misses me. Wow I thought girls were complicated. Lol. That is why I need to see him. I need to read his eyes. The second he looks at me I will be able to tell what he feels without him even saying anything. I am good at that. I can read people easy. I get it from mom. Man she can see right though me. So then why couldn't she see how special Robert was for me. Gosh, I should seriously be thinking about something else other than him. Like school. Hehe. That is more important. But then he is too. He is everything I want in a husband when he is good. I mean he has his flaws but don't we all. Forgive and forget. That is what I do. That is what Pastor Ball said yesterday. You have to forgive a person to enjoy them again. Well, I have forgiven everyone I know. Why can Robert be forgiven. Why can't they let him be apart of my life. I get so angry when I think about it all. I love you parents, but man you really messed up this time. I  have forgiven you for it. So forgive Robert. Geeze, my hands are starting to hurt. Lol. Not used to this much typing. Its like he is a disease. I can't get rid of him in my mind. Now that is unhealthy. But I can push you aside when I need to. Like tonight, way to much homework to dwell on him. Yeah that is what messed me up last semester. To emotionally involved. But this semester I am so much better. I have control over my life again. Yeah!  But I just can't get upset if things don't go my way. I mean life has its ups and downs. And its not Robert that I need in my life. I just need to keep God in my life and He will help me. But then again I wouldn't mind having Robert too. Hehe. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Okay so now I am sitting here preparing to write a stream of consciousness writing. I wonder why I have to type that out what am I thinking of course this is what I am going to write        this music that I am listening to seems to be distracting me a little and the timer I feel very stressed out writing to a real timer I don't know why        I think I will take off my head phones    I had planned to write about a lot but for some reason I can't seem to do more than   write what my head is thinking about    for one is my head supposed to blank out like it just did I guess I can start by describing my environment lets see    the air smells like air    the back of my back is warm from the sun through the window    right now there isn't any noises and I feel somewhat stressed and anxious    the timer keeps going coldly, without a thought to whether or not I actually have a though or not and I think the seconds are scrolling faster than a real second would. maybe my perception of time is defunct    if it were possible to qualify a sigh in thought-form my mind would have just sighed    I can't believe I have to go pick up my friend later today because his car broke down, its like I have to help him but I fear that he may not help me when the same situation like this occurs to me    I just woke up and for some reason there's a sense of dread weighing down on my heart    as if I feared that I am doing this stream of consciousness writing incorrectly    I can't believe I have already written for 5 minutes, time really does pass quickly when you are trying to listen in on your own inner thoughts    but it seems as if my thoughts are triggered by what I am doing, like I cannot seem to get into any deep right now such as the existence or nonexistence of god which I was arguing quite magnificently the other day but instead here I am babbling like my mind is a stream of babble instead of consciousness and I wonder if I am supposed to be aware that any of this is supposed to make sense I really hope it does because if it doesn't well I guess my mind is simply disorganized    but isn't that what a mind should be? disorganized? don't we need to take time to listen to our minds and organize the stream before we talk? its like the old saying, think before you speak and etc etc etc. if this is how my mind really thinks, I really think I cannot type fast enough to fully express the words in my mind. that is an interesting though, do I actually hear a voice in my head right now dictating everything I've just written? that is really weird, is this how our sense of hearing works? I have my own voice in my head only it doesn't have the auditory quality of my own voice, but rather I can hear it, its a strange process         I guess I really can't multitask when I am writing a stream of consciousness I see three ims on the bottom of this screen, all blinking yet unanswered        perhaps I am not truly tracking my own mind I MUST DWELL FURTHER IN. I'd like to reveal something about myself perhaps something I didn't know existed        I remember my childhood I don't know why but for some reason I start remembering it whenever I think too hard that or I am just trying to find something to say for this stream of consciousness either way . the phone is ringing, should I go pick it up? maybe I will just let my parents handle it, but it keeps ringing and ringing and ringing. looks like I had to pick it up for a bit, I hope the professor doesn't penalize me for 20 seconds of non thought but I can make up for it because it was my friend who I needed to help out today, he sounded pretty appreciative though I dismissed him quickly because of this assignment and here I am fixing mistakes in my typing        maybe I should just leave my mistakes in so I can listen to myself more. right well now I feel nostalgic or actually no I don't I just see a blue sky in my thoughts and clear. no with white clouds and its a clear day and I was a little boy there's a feeling that is not quite nostalgia but it permeates through me likes a majestic feeling as if I were over a cliff and viewing the world for the first time, its breathtaking. another thought sigh. I miss my childhood and here I am back behind my computer again full of stress and anxiety. I would view myself as a logical person not to get emotionalized (if that is a word) which it is not a word but I guess its the only way my thoughts can process it without me actually thinking about  it, yeah I make up a lot of words in my thoughts actually its quite strange why does it seem so hard to write about my stream but when actually I have written so much    originally I had planned to write a debate that was in my head about god but I guess that was yesterday night when I was heated up about it today I just feel complacent about writing about nothing. I see nothing revealing in the past couple of paragraphs, just a jumble of words broken thoughts and now I feel disappointed        why am I disappointed? I guess I just thought I could find something that could prove that I am more than just a regular case or is this stuff that I write even regular to all people? I don't know but I like being special. well no. now I feel embarrassed for writing that out and there's only 3 more minutes to describe the rest of my thoughts for today. its weird how if focused my thoughts do not go much into the future, I can't really plan ahead, I can't think about my future, my ambitions seem to fade away I guess this is the nature of this exercise that causes it since you are supposed to write at present thoughts which tend to mold my thoughts into present thoughts and I don't know why that past thought had blurbed into my mind perhaps I forced it to just for some interest in this stream of consciousness, why am I so eager to put interest in this bit, I do like this interface though what that has nothing to do with what I just said god. now I am frustrated at the fact that my mind is so disorganized that or if I tried to organize it I would have nothing to say it is so hard to just spew everything out the way that I think it because my preliminary thought is to first organize it and that takes so much time and for some reason sometimes I end up saying nothing because I dunno I know I obviously have a stream now but I guess since none of it makes much sense I can't really phrase it into communicable words or rather perhaps I am just afraid that if I do people will laugh at me for being an idiot. 8 more seconds. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1. bye     "
Tell me about yourself.,"Rather than sitting at a blank computer screen right now, I am sitting in the hallway outside my dorm room. You see, my roommate Carly is sleeping. She was fortunate to have no classes on friday. I on the other hand, have chemistry on friday mornings at 10. You understand the peril it takes to get out of bed on fridays when she can sleep away, often until long after I return. As is the case today, which is why I am still in the hallway so as to not disturb her sleep. It's not that I need to sleep right now, it's the idea behind it--she sleeping while I am up and writing this paper. This paper by the way is the first of two papers I have been blessed to right today. This writing assignment is fun; it's pretty interesting to see where your mind will go in a matter of a few minutes or seconds. One word or thought will take you in a completely new and most of the time, very different direction. Back to the second paper I'll be writing today. My ethics in nursing class has a paper due next thursday. We meet twice a week, one on tuesdays and once on thursdays. It is quite a walk to the nursing building. It is located at the far end of campus, so much so that often times it is omitted from maps of campus. But, I enjoy the class so the walk is manageable. Ahh, all these pop ups keep coming while I am writing this. I really don't like the idea of pop ups. Back to my paper. We discuss some pretty controversial subjects in the ethics class, all in preparation for the nursing field. It's hard to think of everything that we will one day face. That is, if we actually get accepted into the nursing program. It's pretty tough I believe. They don't accept everyone which leans its way to be a competitive program. I hope I get accepted. It seems to be the direction that God is pointing my towards. I don't now though; I think  I need to have a couple more talks with him to see where He wants me and  where I might serve him best. Well, I'm approaching the end of this writing assignment activity. So without further adew(I don't really know how to    spell that word, but go with me on it) this will end my first writing assignment for psychology. I sure hope I accomplished the task at hand. It seemed easy enough. but I guess we'll see. My phone is ringing. I bet it is Sterling. "
Tell me about yourself.,"so I'm sitting here. I don't know what to talk about. except for the fact that the latest mars volta cd is amazing. I especially enjoy the way they manipulate the texture of the music. its panned all different kinds of ways to where if you're listening to it in a portable cd player or anything that has a distinct sound system you can notice all these minute details that they have injected in there. any other way would require you to have incredibly sharp hearing sense. I can't believe I have a kitten now. my mom told me to take care of it and get a job to support it. I just laughed at that. is it getting hot in here? I swear. one second I'm cold and the next I'm burning up. and for some reason I'm having a hard time typing right now. I think its because of the temperature. that and lack of knowledge of what to say. my cat is crawling up my leg and meowing right now. I wonder what it is that she wants. I wonder why the mars volta decided to say now I'm lost"" as the most definitive part of the chorus. its pretty great anyways. aww. the cat wants to snuggle in my lap. too cute. I'm going to have to do so much reading tonight. sheish. so many classes and concepts to keep up with. something smells like kitty litter. uggg. kitten. she needs to stop biting me. ahh. she is going to tear my sweater. that is my favorite sweater! I've been everywhere and through everything in this black sweater. I started out with it during my emo days of high school and then grew up wearing it. good times and bad, I've worn this sweater. man. I can't wait until I have my interview with saul williams. its going to be so rad. I can't wait to do research on him so that I can know about every little detail to talk about. hold on. I need to take the sweater off. great. right when I decide to do that the air conditioning decides to come on. just my luck, it always works out this way. I wonder if I could ever get my poetry published. it would be amazing to claim that I wrote a book or compiled just a whole bunch of all the poetry I've written. sometimes I get paranoid that someone's going to copy and steal it since I have it online. not a good idea rola. boy I really like this song. I wish I could write songs this amazing. I just wish my band didn't decide to split. they did it and didn't tell me. lead singer slash guitar player is the last to find out. really genuine folks. that is how life decides to roll the dice though. man, that party after the mars volta showithsaul williams interview is going to be killer. that is, if anyone decides to drive 3 hours and spend the weekend here. hopefully they will. that would be crazy. I need a band again. we need to get our dang cd mastered already so that I can play it on the radio. I need to remember to get one of joey's cds when I'm back in irving so that I can get them to play that on the radio. man, I really hope he gets signed soon. he is so talented and puts so much effort into everything he does. it just feels like he gets nothing out of everything. all the sacrifices he makes and all the time he spends, and he just ends up getting screwed over by life in the end. I wish I could make everything better. I wish I were a magic fairy who could wave a magic wand and make all of his dreams come true so that he wouldn't have to worry about anything ever again. I wish I could do that for anyone. I could pick who's deserving or not. that wouldn't be fair though since I wouldn't be deserving of making such decisions myself. dang I'm so philosophical. good thing that is my major. uh oh. I told a psychology write-up that I'm a philosophy major. I'm assured to fail now. eh. I'm so tired. I wish I could get more sleep. it was pretty nice to talk about depression today. hah. I used to be depressed. severely. I'm so glad that all of that is in the past. its nice to look back and learn about yourself. I'm such a changed person. and I keep changing. and I keep analyzing myself and noticing different things about myself from day to day that surprise me and don't surprise me. I wish more people at school knew me. I've always been the person to walk the halls and have everyone know my name but me not know anyone else's name. that is my deal. people would know me. it sucks that this college can't be like that. what? in like fifty five thousand people? you're lucky if you find your own hand in that many people. the buses are so annoying. everytime I walk up to the dang bus stop and stand in front of the doors it just leaves without me. like it knows when I'm about to come so that it can leave. that is how the buses here in austin know when its time to leave the stop. they just see me coming and its the all-time cue. that is what they teach the new bus drivers in training. if they ask ""so when do we leave?"" they say ""when rola comes. "" my head itches. press the ""finish"" button when you're done. twenty dang minutes is a long ace time to keep writing nothingness. its all good in the hood, I have like less than 6 minutes to go. w00t! you know. it seriously sucks that people suck. I wish people could be a whole lot nicer than they are. but what is nice anyways? gosh. we can go all philosophy on that as it is. spend like an hour and a year on that subject alone. screw it. I'm not in the mood to analyze anything. I'm just so tired. and that kitten won't quit messing with the blinds. if only I could stop typing this, get up, and stop that. she is making the blind strings look like snakes from where I'm sitting. and now the string is caught in her paw. just great. its like I'm babysitting. no, it feels like I'm a mom now. just more and more responsibility for me. but she is so cute that its worth it. man. I wish I could play an amazing guitar riff like the one I'm hearing right now. I miss playing music a lot every week. I miss being on stage. gosh I wish I had that feeling right now. ultimate bliss. no! instead I'm sitting here typing this stupid thing so that I can get credit in psychology. I better make a freaking A in this class or I'll be so pissed it will be the end of the world and destiny at the same time. if anyone read what I'm typing right now. I'm sure they would pee in their pants from how afraid they would be that a person like me exists. they're probably getting a lot weirder responses than this though. right? RIGHT? less than one minute and I'm a free-bird! and that is not a pun! whoever yells to play that at shows. dude. you're so behind on the times! that is like the oldest thing to say ever. you're just joining the masses when you submit to saying that at every show you go to. tradition or not. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm not quite sure what to write about, and I highly doubt that anything interesting will come out of this paper! It makes me nervous to turn in a paper that I won't have time to proofread or check over. One of my English teachers used to take off points exponentially for every grammar error in the paper! Luckily my teachers aren't like that and this is the first paper I've had to write so far. Which is a good thing, I'm definitely not complaining. It is also the first actual homework assignment I have had, the rest is just reading and reading and more reading! Luckily most of it is interesting. I know in high school they said that college would be much harder and that there is more homework, but I don't think so. It isn't harder because there is more time to accomplish things in. the. Besides, teachers aren't so anal here. Maybe it's just UT, but I love it! I love the liberal attitude! Anyway, my roommate is due back at any second. Everytime I hear doors slam or flip flops coming this way, I think it is her. It's a bit distracting, although I guess in a way I already am distracted. I just don't know what to write about! I really hope this paper isn't graded on content! But Rachel, my roommate, is really nice. She thinks she is a witch, which I thought was incredibly weird, but whatever. I haven't seen anything weird since I've been here. Unless one considers a tarot reading weird that is. She did a reading on the phone to her boyfriend of three weeks that she has never met! Isn't that weird? I can't imagine that relationship going anywhere. But it makes me feel glad that I have Michael. He is been my boyfriend for two years, and now that we are in different cities, it's hard! I think he is taking it harder than I am, but I don't know how to help him! I guess that if the situation was reversed, I would be freaking out too. It's just that I have so many things to do here, that I can't talk to him every single time he wants to. Maybe things will improve with time. I finally found the lyrics to Enya's song called ?Only Time. ? It really has a great message, although almost all of her songs do. As the title implies, she talks about how only time knows everything. Time knows if you will stay married or if your troubles will go away. Knowing that is great, it's just hard. Kind of like the saying ?easier said than done. ? It's hard waiting for things! Not material things necessarily, but for success and happiness and similar things. I guess that's what everyone wants; happiness. I'm scared that I won't find it in my future work. Even though I love helping people and I know Social Work is a great thing, social workers make less than $30,000 a year! It makes me wonder if I have some greater purpose in life. So many things interest me that I feel pressured in choosing what to follow through with. A friend of mine has the same problem and she said ?I feel like I have 10 souls inside of me and each wants to do a different thing. ? And I feel the same way! Ideally I just want to make a difference and help people. I'm sure that somewhere in the next four years I will figure out what I want to do. It makes me wonder how other people just automatically know what they want to do. Is it because they are really good at something and want to follow through with it, or is it just because they made a random decision and want to stick with it? Who knows! I have nothing to do all night which is the perfect chance to study, but for some reason I just can't concentrate. Maybe it's because I took a nap and now all I want to do is go back to sleep! For the first few weeks I was sleeping wonderfully, but I haven't been able to for the past few days. Maybe Pennebaker's talk about college kids having sleep problems affected me! I doubt it though. But it is great being in Psychology. Although the book can be a bit boring sometimes, some of the subjects are incredibly fascinating and I can relate to most of them! Michael laughs at me all the time because I am constantly trying to justify things in life by what I learn in psychology. He has a terrible memory, so when I learned about the hippocampus or the amygdala or whichever it was, I immediately thought of him. And of course he laughed at me and thought I was silly to think that he had a medical deficiency since he couldn't remember things well. Oh well I guess! At least he loves me! Well, I have one more minute and I don't know what I'm supposed to close this off with, but I guess that means I'm supposed to keep rambling on. I would be really interested in seeing what kind of study these are being used for, if any. I would love to see what people wrote about. Probably friends and school, which seems to be what mine is dominated by, but maybe not! "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, I guess this is the first time that I have ever done anything like this. I mean, the first time that I have talked about ANYTHING to anyone. What I'm really thinking about right now is index cards. I need to make flash cards for my Introduction to Medical and Scientific Terminology class, and I don't have any index cards. I feel like I need to complete that task now. Why is it that I must always do EVERYTHING in one day? I just can't ever seem to take my  time and relax. I guess if I had any form of OCD, that would be it; I'm a perfectionist who needs to clear her schedule. Now, if I wait until this Stream of Consciousness Writing is over, it'll be like almost eleven thirty at night before I'm done. Should I really go out and get my index cards then? I need like a pack of 200 of them, but I really need more for the future. I guess I could wait to get more index cards when I get home to Houston this weekend, then I would know exactly where to buy them, or I could even get my mom to get them for me in Houston, that would be very convenient for me. I miss my mom most. She does everything for me. Its not that I miss her just because she did everything for me; its just that she is this really great person. She is so genuine. I know she loves me truly because she goes out of her way to make me happy. Why can't I meet more people like that in my life? I hope I marry someone who can take care of me as well as my mom and dad can. Man, I miss my dog, too. I guess I am a little obsessed with my dog, but I can't help it. She is so cute. And she is been there ever since I was like 12. We're inseparable, and I wonder and worry about how she is doing without me. Dogs are great aren't they? They never get angry at you or make you upset. They always are loyal, and give love one hundred percent. I wish that people could be as nice as dogs are. I wish my boyfriend would be happier. He is the main reason why I worry so much of the time. I really never thought it was really possible to cry so much that your eyes get swollen, until I met him. I worry a lot about him, not about our relationship, but about him. I wish he would be happier, treat himself better, love himself more, and feed himself. The man's the pickiest man I have ever met! I have never made one thing that he thought was yummy. I have never taken him to a restaurant that he thought was good. Everything is always decent. "" Decent? I know he doesn't mean to be condescending in any way, but it really makes it seem that he is being super condescending. I know that he feels that he wants to enjoy the fine fruits of life; food being one that should be simple to enjoy, but with his ideal of fine food, I don't know if he will ever feel that. That's one thing about psychology. My boyfriend always says what he wants, but he never feels it when I try to give it to him. I believe that he never feels it because somewhere in his head, his innate response to anything I do is a negative one, therefore his response is negative. His mind tells him to not like it and therefore he ends up thinking that he really doesn't like it. It's all in the mind. If he told himself to like it, he would; But the fact of the matter is that he doesn't. All right, I'm going to shut up about him all ready. I think that this writing assignment is pretty cool. It's like writing in an electronic diary, like on the show ""Sex and the City,"" except that these thoughts are really not very private because I guess Professor Pennebaker or one of the TA's is going to read it, but I'm really okay with one of them reading it. It's not like I have anything really vulgar or nasty to say. I'm so full. I don't think I should have eaten all that Kraft Macaronni and Cheese, but hey, on the bright side, its a great source of calcium, which is something that growing women need, so I guess its kind of a good thing. Hahaha. I can't believe that I just tried to justify overeating, at least I don't have to worry about getting fat over it. Nobody in my family is fat or even chubby. I don't think I've gained any weight here because I do so much walking, so who cares if I ate extra macaroni; I used skim milk instead of whole milk, and I added salt to it instead of butter, thus I feel no guilt. Dude, I could really go for a Coke right now. Coca Cola is so good. Its so expensive though, and its so bad for your teeth and kidneys. What makes it taste so good? I think its that bubbly feeling you get in the back of your throat when you drink it; not like that nasty gross Diet Cola. Diet Cola is disgusting. I don't understand why people drink Diet when there's real Cola. I'm sleepy. I don't sleep much here in Austin, because all I do is go to school, and then I come home, eat, and then do homework for the whole rest of the time. It's a bitch. I need my sleep man. I don't get more than 5 hours of sleep at most. I had four freaking classes today! Can you believe that? from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon, I had class. And get this, what really made today bad was that while I was waiting for the bus, a huge, green, black striped, spider was crawling up my shirt and was like two inches away from my face! I thought I was going to DIE! I HATE SPIDERS! If I had any kind of phobia, its spiders. I don't like any bugs, but Spiders are the worst. They're so ugly and creepy and scary. I thought I was really going to cry. It made me so anxious and nervous. I went home and showered. My writing assignment is almost over now. I feel a little bit of relief and a little bit sad at the same time, how pathetic. hahaha. I'm kinda sad because I like writing all my thoughts down, but I'm relieved because I have a lot of other stuff to do still. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Ok. I really don't know what I am supposed to be doing. I am just thinking. Hmmm. What am I thinking about. my stomach is growling. oh look its my jeremy camp cd I have not listened to that in a while. I wonder if carrie and I will drive to the concert in abilene on thurs. I don't want to make her go if she does not want to. hmmm. thirsty now. why is this water bottle green. that color is not so great to look at. interesting. thank goodness its friday. I miss home. college is not as easy as I thought it would be. its too quiet in this room. I can't stand it being so quiet. I want to get up and have someone to talk to but no one is here. What is up with my stomach. Its jumping around in knots. Goodness gracious. Mmm. M&ms look good in that cup over there. Ok. Five minutes have passed. it was not so bad. I have so much to do today. I have to get my cell phone fixed with some more minutes. I wonder if they will make me sign another contract. My mom might be right about that. I need to make a list. Right after I am done with this that is what I will do. Wonder when Carrie's class ends. I bet she is sleeping. Art history can't be that fun. My mouth is watering because of all of the hunger. What am I to do. Its all about willpower. The football game is too early tomorrow. I need to figure out if I need to move my car out to the garage. Why don't the stupid people keep me informed. Its crazy, I pay 650 for a parking space but you have to move it on game days. Craziness. Its cold in here. I need a jacket. O, the blanket will work. Wonder what texture this thing is made out of. I will turn off the fan. That will help. hmm. It is hard to consciously think about your thoughts. Who would have thought. I wonder how long that helium balloon is going to stay up. It has been four days. My foot itches. I miss Josh. I wonder if he will call today. Hopefully he got my letter. I wonder what he is doing. ok I need to stop thinking about him. I can't look at these pictures on my board. They just make me sad and reminded of home. I hope Britt is doing alright. I wondered why little Josh imed me. I bet he is asking me a question about a girl. Hehe. He is such a cute little boy. Hopefully he is doing alright too. Ok now I am bored. Why is that highlighter on the floor. Is it mine or Carrie's. Must be mine. Fell out of my bag. I need to read today. Maybe take a nap first. Have to go to the store and get a new earring because my ear hurts. Its no good. Why does it have a big lump on it. I think it must be infected. Wow. That was a slow minute. Need to talk to mom about some money and paying Carrie back. I need to find that paper that says the stuff. so much to do. Those are some pretty trees outside. Austin does have better weather than Houston. Hope it does not rain more today. well time is up. bye. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well I am sitting at my desk. It's kinda dark in here so I just turned on the lamp. I have a lot of homework to finish, most of it for the psych class. My homework has not been too bad so far. Just a lot of reading. I am ready to go home and see my cat, I really miss him more than other things that I should probably miss more. My mom would get mad if she heard me say that, but sadly it is true. Well my mind is a blank, I can't really think of anything to say I know we are supposed to just type whatever comes to mind, but my mind goes completely blank whenever I try to write anything, no matter what it is. I guess that is why I never could keep a journal or anything like that. I would start out the first day writing some, then it just tapered off until I stopped writing completely. I have several journals with only the first couple of pages written on. Wow 20 minutes is a long time, its only been 5 since I started. I'm trying to keep writing for the entire duration, but it is weird how when you are supposed to write freely your mind won't cooperate. I guess that is what you are trying to figure out. It is ironic how the mind works, that is why I have always wanted to take a psychology class, so I could better understand its inner workings. I am frustrated that I really cannot think of a single thing however. I miss my best friend, Faith. She is at Oachita (spelling?) in Arkadelphia. It is about 8 hours from here. I am thinking about going and visiting her over spring break, but that is a little hard without a car. I will probably have to fly home first and get my car from there. Surprisingly my parents are not going to sell it (like they originally planned) and are keeping it at home (where it is currently getting no use). I guess it was their last attempt to get me to come home some of the time. I am only going home once before the holidays. That's only for my high school's homecoming. Which I am kind of excited about. I know a few of my good friends that are also coming home for the game, so I will get to see them. That is the only weird thing about college. You realize how much your friends meant to you. It is odd not seeing them during class like you are used to. But, luckily I have met a few great people, and we have become good friends. I knew 8 people coming down here and only three of them I was actually good friends with. The other five were more acquaintances. I already semi-knew my roommate, she went to school in the same district, and we met through our parents. We have since become better friends. I am sure whoever ends up reading this really wants to know all these things, but I figured I might as well write something. Well let's see. I went on a mission trip to Mexico this summer. I only thought of this because there is a picture of me and some of the kids we worked with on my desk. It was truly an awesome experience. I am a changed person because of that two week experience. Well I guess I won't get into any other subject. My time is ticking away, funny how it goes by faster when you type. very ironic. and that is about all, thank you! "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well I'm supposed to write and I don't really know what to say. I'm sitting in my room with my roommates while they listen to music and watch TV. I wasn't doing anything productive so I thought I'd get this writing assignment out of the way. Do typos matter? Because I keep erasing, but I don't think it really matters. Ok I left one in. So it's really hot in here. And my computer is way too far away from me and it kinda hurts to type. But oh well. I'm waiting for the cartoon Home Movies, to come on. I don't usually watch cartoons, but I saw this one once and it's really funny and I liked it a lot. Wow, only 3 minutes have gone by. I think I'm going to get pretty tired after 20 minutes. I'm so sick of studying. My roommate is talking about a little girl in a Missy Elliot video. What song is this? I have no idea. I'm hungry, but I can't eat and type at the same time. My side itches. hold on a second. Aw there we go. Much better. So I don't understand why I have so much work to do in my English class. It's ridiculous! It's making me so frustrated. My other classes give decent amounts of work to do, but that class is crazy! I have to read 22 chapters in Jane Eyre by Tuesday. Oh I like this song. Probably shouldn't listen to it too loud because I'm trying to type, but it's ok. I seem to be doing ok with it on so far. I'm really tired and I wish I could just go to sleep but I need to study some more before I do. I have to wake up early tomorrow and it really sucks. Wow, I complain a lot. I don't mean to, but I do. Ok. running out of things to say. Talk about smells. can't smell much. It's pretty plain-smelling in here if that makes sense. Damn! Only 8 minutes have passed! Twenty minutes feels like forever. We did a stream of consciousness paper in Creative Writing in high school and I remember how much my hand hurt while I was doing it. I need a massage. my neck and back are really sore. Maybe from sleeping on a too-small and uncomfortable couch last night. And from driving from College Station (no I wasn't at A&M) to San Antonio and then to Austin today. That could do it to you! Well I want a pretzel. They're sitting right next to me but I can't get them. When is this thing going to over with? I wonder what you learn from this? How weird and random people are? I think I'm a pretty random person. I used to say that word a lot in middle school. I hated middle school so much. I don't know why. It was just horrible for the most part. And high school wasn't much better. I like college a lot more than both already. Well my show should be coming on soon. I can't wait to watch it. I hope it's a funny episode! I always tell people how funny it is and then they watch the one episode that's NOT funny and think I'm stupid. Not that I care, but I want people to know that it's a really funny show. I need to be studying for English. No, not English, music. English just popped into my head. Hmm. Ok only 6 more minutes. I think I can handle this. Wow, it got quiet in here. And really really hot too! At first our A/C was broken and our room was 60 degrees, and we complained that it was too cold. And now they fixed it and it's soooooo hot in here. Katie just discovered Longhorn Delivery. I love that thing! I used to use it all the time when I used to come visit friends in Austin. We were all pretty lazy. I'm becoming less lazy here I think. I have to walk everywhere and can't really rely on other people to do things for me like at home. I want to go home and get some things and see my animals and my parents. I'm not homesick, but it'll be cool to see how things have changed since I left. My parents have been re-doing the house, probably out of boredom. I think it's cute that they're doing little projects together now. I hope they have fun living together alone again, like before they had me and brother. I've been warned it's almost 11:30 and HOme Movies will be on shortly! I'm excited. I think it's sad to get so excited about a cartoon, but you have to get excited about something! Well my time is almost up aND  I'm glad. Oops, I hit the caps lock for a little bit. Ok 10 seconds. And I'm done! "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now I'm thinking what I am going to write about. I am so tired and so ready for this weekend. I just worked four or five days straight and now I get the whole weekend off. So I am so excited, yet so exhausted. School is fun yet is hard to keep up with all the readings for every class all the time. I don't know if I doing anything right or not. If I actually understand what each class is going to be like or if I will succeed in every class. Tomorrow I have a full day off with only two classes and the rest of the evening to do whatever. FINALLY a night to do whatever I want to and enjoy the college life and atmosphere. Explore what UT has to offer. I need to talk to my teacher that I am an aide for by next Wednesday, when am I going to have time to talk to her throughout my busy schedule. All the books piling up on my bed. things I need to get done today or at least by this weekend so that I am caught up for classes next week. Finally next weekend I will be abl3e to go home. able to see all of my friends that I have not seen in probably 2 months. I am trying to be as quiet as possible so that my roommate can study and do whatever she is doing without me bothering her. I need to go shopping for some food for my dorm so that I actually have something to eat. Guess I'll probably go there tomorrow and find things that I will need and also eat. What am I going to do this weekend with all the stuff going on in austin. am I going to stay here or should I head back home? what should I do. Guess I'll see what I feel like this when this weekend comes. Gosh. I wish this time would be almost up so that I can get on to studying for my classes that I actually have tomorrow. I have so much to do yet so little time. Hmmmm. this pink lemonade that I made is kinda tangy, maybe needs some more water. I just feel like I have so much energy right now that I could do anything. I need to make some calls to the people I have not talked to in a while and just catch up on everything that is going on. my ffet are cold. guess I better go put on some socks. my ass is also getting kinda sore from sitting on this hard wooden chair that the dorms provide. I probably need to get a pillow so that I can sit here longer. dang my room also needs to be cleaned. it seems like the dust takes only a couple of seconds to land and make everything look dirty. the blue rug sure is starting to look sad. guess I need to go borrow the vacuum cleaner downstairs so that I can get it looking better. the room also feels like it is getting colder. I sure need to go shopping. sooon. but I have no money. I need to get some money from my parents. how I sure do miss having them around and having everything paid for. the room is so bland and plain. the green ugly tack board thing could use some decoration. I wish people wouldn't have to come see my room on Friday. maybe I won't be here when they come or maybe I might make it a point not to be here since at least my side looks pretty drab. my biology book is sure bigger sitting on the shelf than I realized. I sure need to catch up in that class since I really don't like biology. next friday when I get out of class I need to have my stuff packed up so right after I can head home. I can go visiting and then go to homecoming to see everyone. I don't think I will stay long, because I might feel awkward being in college and going to a high school football game. People might look at me weird. I don't like when people stare at me. I need to sign and fill out this form for my nursing class, it will be due pretty soon. I just don't feel like doing any of it. what should I do this weekend. Its so confusing. what should I do. Wow. I didn't realize all the room that I still have left on my shelves, I can still store a lot of more stuff on them. I sure have not played a game lately. I wish I could find someone that knows how to play dominoes, I really wan tot play dominoes with my brand new ones. I'm getting so bored, wandering around the room trying to think about other things that I need to get done, abll the stuff to do and so little amount of time to do it. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm writing a stream of consciousness paper, yeah! well, my friend John is sitting next to me submitting his calculus homework. I'm wondering if I will have more success when I submit mine. John's a good guy but never helps out with calculus. some friend. I wish that this thing was over. 20 minutes is looking like a long time. I didn't think twenty minutes could be so long. I guess it's all relativity. If I was on a beach in cancun 20 minutes would go by in the blink of an eye. but here, no. I'm hear for eternity, or twenty minutes whichever comes first. the internet is down in my room so I have to use this damn facility at the base of my dorm, man this sucks. the damn airwave guy was supposed to come down and take care of the internet problem but it turns out he doesn't give a rat's ass about the internet or my calculus or my stream of consciousness, man he sucks big time. keep thinking about Trina wonder what she is doing. wonder how many guys she is been with since rejecting me. damn, stay positive, it's the only way to get through boring times. shouldn't smoke anymore either. smoking's bad and yet it's so damn good. man good thing I don't smoke or I might be enjoying a good nicotine buzz right now. what's the deal with hannah anyway? I mean I'm not attracted to her anymore because she reaks of desperation I mean that bugs me. why does she always have to guilt trip me, fooling around with her is like a full time job. wish I could have gone to jack in the box even though that food will make me fat. hannah said that food would make her fat. maybe we're both right. I hate the cafeteria food here. today I couldn't stomach any of it. got to make a check out to tom for 25 dollars for the ceiling fans that weren't even put in the right way. that dude with the messed up teeth installed the improperly  the first time anyway, they almost crushed john and marissa. what a shit weekend, john had someone to do and I didn't haha. clever pun. clever reminds me of that one girl I met at the ATO house and we talked macbeth and I got her number but that didn't stop her from not returning my calls, I need to find some way to get a flask into the football games that way the buzz doesn't wear off and I can keep on buzzing baby. yeah I remember the time on this very computer I walked by and some Australian dude was looking at the most obscene porn I've ever seen in my life. I wonder what everyone else's stream of consciousness papers look like. I wonder if mine is ore or less neurotic than everyone else. I really should get a girlfriend like my sweet mate tom the golden boy. he is the golden boy because he wins at fucking everything. smart, good looking, athletic, in a word I hate his guts. but I don't really he is my friend I just wish the playing field was a little more even so that I could get some females for whatever reason. the guy is so lucky, he is rich and he doesn't really have to make grades in college and he has enough money to join a fucking frat and it pisses me off because the frat guys wanted me too but I have neither the money nor the time with school because some of us have to make the grade just to get a decent job and make a little money. I thought college would be so cool, but it absolutely sucks. I mean, why did I have this delusion that college would be so damn great, it's just like high school. which was just like middle school with cars. man, life is truly what you make of it. On the one hand you got fewer people hassling you, on the other hand you have a lack of support. man I wish we hadn't got cable in our room, now I especially don't want to study, I need mary jus t called me. better not answer. she is kinda weird, maybe she got an OU UT wristband, yeah well, sorry I didn't get you your I'D mary, you shouldn't have left it over here. I wish I had a car and also some more socks because when you've got socks you don't have to do as much laundry. Jessica simpson is such a bitch, all through middle school me and my friends would have killed to get some"" from her. but now that she has that new show on mtv that's all reality and stuff I realize what an absolute hose beast she is, man she sucks big time well its getting near the end of this I wonder where the research page is so I can get some credit hours and not fail the damn class. I suppose that 's it 3 v sorry dude I only signed up for twenty. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I cannot believe that my mother called to tell me about the pregnancy test, it's none of her fucking business. Besides she doesn't have to shout it out I wonder if my roommate hear, now she is playing that damn music again. red hot chili peppers. I should really be reading my book for lit right now instead of doing this, I wonder if my watch is going to break again, broke twice today. I just bought that nice new one and I've hardly worn it. Don't want to mess it up with scratches and all. I still can't believe that about mom. She can be such a god-damn BITCH. I think she is calling to see how I am, and instead she just screams at me about the damn clinic. At least I avoided her questions pretty well, but she can still draw her own conclusions. I want to talk to Jenny. it's been a while since we've had a good talk. All she tells me about now is her boyfriend David. That relationship is trouble. She is not her own person anymore; she lives for him now. She doesn't even stay at home, is over at his place all day, lies to her mom, and uses ME as an excuse. Damn. I haven't talked to Penner in a while. I hope he is thinking about me. I need to call him and also send him his present. Hope he likes the card I picked out. it suits both him and me, so I thought it was perfect. I hope my cell phone doesn't crap out on me again it's so old and worthless. My arm is itching. I wonder if I should wear sunscreen tomorrow since I have been burning a little. trade off between cancerous skin damage and nice-looking tan skin God, I could use some coffee especially since I'll be up for a while reading all that stuff I hope punctuation doesn't count in this I don't think it does anyway. It's probably going to tell me how negative and depressed I am. I am not really, though I am pissed at mom and I hate that I am at UT Even the name conveys a sense of sheer stupidity. I worked my ass off for Berkeley and here I am in this hell-hole. I hate these damn community bathrooms, and I hate that the laundry room is so far away. God the last time I wrote this crazily was when I wrote that suicide note junior year of high school I hate that Granoff I hope he burns in hell for making my life fall to shit like that. If not for him, I might be in Berkeley right now instead, but grade aside, I can't forgive him for all the emotional damage he did When I read that note later, it made me cry to see how far into depression I had fallen. And mom didn't even help me after I cried out for help. well how ironic that I'm in psychology now. The psychology major needed a shrink herself. hahha. I hope tomorrow is not very sunny but I don    t want rain either. too much sun hurts my eyes. I hope I don't oversleep since I'll be up so late tonight. I can't believe someone cut and pasted a dvd manual in this one time; it's such an easy assignment. God my hips are huge. I have lost weight since I came here, all this walking around. But I want to lose a little more. I wish I had Katie's body. She is so gorgeous! Even more so than Jenny, and Jenny is one of the most beautiful people I know. But I am not all bad myself, I have my moments certainly. My jaw hurts again; I've been holding it too tensely because I am so stressed out I was perfectly fine until my mom called. well I'm almost finished, just a few minutes left. I wish I had a new phone. I hope that photo of my friends at banquet from last year doesn't fade; the light is right over it but I guess I have the negatives if I want another print. That reminds me, I haven't done photography in a long time. I left because I wasn't progressing, they didn't teach me anything, and I didn't like having to ward off Thomas. nice guy, but what a dork and oh so weird. I wonder if that was Ryan Penner in front of me in math today. I told penner I'd contact him, but I don't know. what an easy quiz "
Tell me about yourself.,"So this assignment is sort of interesting. It's like your thoughts go faster than you think regardless of the speed at which you type. Oh, my, that guy in my keyboarding class during my 9th grade year in high school, so sad, I remember he has special assignments because he couldn't handle writing a paragraph. The teacher was lucky if she could get a sentence out of him. What was her name? . I have no idea, I remember seeing her at the mall one day during junior year, and she recognized me. Probably because I was one of the only kids who took her seriously. Poor gal, it had to be hard to be ignored like that all of the time. At least she was really sweet, so people didn't have real hate for her. Ah, the days at Hutchinson. I can't' believe my roommate is in the Longhorn Band, actually the Flags. I wonder if she will quit. She doesn't seem to have the time to devote to it. Yesterday a returning flag member quit for those reasons. I wish she wasn't so irrational. The day she said she was going to quit, and she got that jar of candy so she stayed~! What is that?  Candy doesn't make you have time. Let's be a little more mature here. Get your lips ready?  What. it's posted on her computer, I haven't quite figured her out yet, I don't know if I ever will. My friends seem to hate her from the stories I tell, and I'm not sure if I blame them. Ah, roommate hell, who does not' experience it. At least we aren't fighting yet. And her stupid camera. I can't' believe she complains about not having money yet she spent 300 dollars on a digital camera. So now she has something else to take up her time, learning how to use it. So so so unproductive. I wonder if she wants to study for the chemistry test together. I hope not, I don't think she is even started the homework and it's due tonight at 11, Oh, well I should stop worrying for her. I haven't looked at our fire escape plan, wonder if it's ever been used. I would imagine so with the kitchen downstairs and all, at least the building is only two stories, I guess I have a better chance of getting out this way, in case of a fire. My closet light is still on, and I want to turn it off a lot, but I shouldn't get up from the computer so I'll just keep thinking about it for the next 14 minutes, oh well, nothing I can do about it now. And on the closet light, I can't believe we had to have a sticky note up by the light switch for a week signifying which switch went to what. Cristina couldn't manage to remember that the room light was the bottom one. I guess I am just critical of her lack of comprehension and common sense. I learned where the word common sense comes from while reading the Psychology textbook. I bet if I thought about if for a second I'd remember what it was. I think it was an incorrect believe that involved the word commas. I'll look it up when I finish. I think it was in chapter one. I have managed to read so much for that class, but I'm still a little behind, only halfway through chapter four and I'm supposed to be done by 330 this afternoon, I really should read like three chapters of that this weekend, I find it fascinating and I want to read it, but my friends have been getting in the way of my studies. That's probably a bad sign. I need to get through to them that I am here to learn. Having fun just comes naturally and doesn't require the effort that learning does. I agreed with Pennebaker in the handout that you have the opportunity to be in two classes if you read the textbook, and I want to. It's like I built up the desire to learn over the summer from doing nothing, absolutely nothing. I really should have had a job. I made a total of like 200 dollars this whole summer, probably spent like 500 or more. I'm so bad about that. Hopefully I will grow out of that habit through the years of college. I haven't even written a paper in probably almost four months. I hope when I take masterworks of lit I don't have too much analytical writing to do (false hope). Sigh, candy. I really need to watch what I eat, this whole freshman fifteen will really scare a girl more than people would imagine. I am not going to let myself get all blubbidy. well it's the word that came to mind and that is what they asked for. I wonder if they analyze this crap. Like how though. It would be like measuring how many times people say I, or say something negative. ha, I'd take the cake on that one. I should work on my negativity. but that's not something that can just be changed overnight. I should just slowly work on focusing on things more bright and enjoyable. If you focus on the negative for too long you become depressed and nothing makes you happy. And I'm a little prone to that being as homesick as I am. I just miss the people. My best friends, people who's opinions of me are solidly formed and won't change overnight. Screw Paul!  My stupid friend I met here who's already decided he doesn't want to be around me after being full-fledged into our friendship he tells me I'm fake and intimidating. buck up pal. my other friends agreed with me though, I really haven't changed much, he just works me up in his head and then I'm just regular old me in person and he gets himself disappointed. I hope we don't have any, or many, awkward encounters. We shouldn't. He is all into his Liberal Arts stuff. and I'll never be in that area. I love engineering for that. I don't have to take many classes in stuff that I am not good at or interested in. I don't want to sit around and think about the world and do it in the way I was taught. But I don't want to be a snotty engineer who thinks that I'm better because I'm studying math. AAAAAHHH, I hate college politics already. The Engineering Dean is really really overconfident in the school. I couldn't believe he told us we were better because our overall SAT scores were better, DUH they were better, the school doesn't have to accept ANYONE in the top 10 percent of their high school. and the rest of the university does! bah. I can't take that sort of unfounded confidence and bragging. And I think I'll encounter it in many of my peers over the next few years. That stupid closet light is driving me crazy. I want to turn it off so much and I only have to wait another three minutes. My roommate's AIM is still on, I bet her cousin, BOOBS, is thinking I'm her and trying to tease her about Enrique. I wonder if there are possibilities of this paper being deemed not stream of consciousness and me having to redo it. Maybe. I bet they take a random sample and so some people get caught turning in crap, but others don't, and that guy that pasted the manual just happened to get randomly selected. I wonder if they do the 10 percent thing, simply ten percent of the population, oooooh yeah, I learned so much in Statistics. Except I don't think I'll ever remember the details. Mrs. Perez was such a sweetheart, I hope she is doing alright. I miss my high school, for some reason I don't want to type the name of it. So awkward not knowing who is going to read this. Hopefully I won't be deemed a crazy . haha, along with the clingies, creepies, doodlers, boppers,. factoids save me. and I'm just about done, sad that I kept watching the clock the whole time. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm thinking that this is a crazy assignment. It's only been 17 seconds, I have a long way to go. My stupid brother keeps instant messaging me, I wish he would go away. There's a menu on my desk to a sandwich place we went to yesterday, that was pretty good. I wonder what we'll eat tonight. I'm tired of Jester Pizza. It's really not that good. Now it's only been a minute and 37 seconds. 40 seconds. Stupid kid keeps I'M-ing me. Good now he signed off. My roommate is reading the fourth Harry Potter book and I can hear her turning the pages. She is also drinking something and sipping really loudly, which is really getting annoying, but I don't know if I should say anything about it because that would probably be construed as rude and it's awfully early in the year to have her mad at me already. I've been chewing this gum for about an hour now and it's almost completely lost it's flavor. My sandal just fell off and I wonder where it went. My roommate stopped sipping whatever it was. I think it was soup. Who drinks soup out of a cup?  Aren't you supposed to use a spoon?  Maybe we're  out of spoons. That's no good. I'm going home this weekend so maybe I'll get my mom to buy us some new spoons. My phone is ringing and I'm pretty sure it's my ex-boyfriend Keith but I'm not going to answer it. I'll probably tell him it's because I'm writing this, but I really just don't feel like talking to him right now. His new relationship is probably not going well and he probably wants to talk about it so we can get back together, but I don't really want to. I don't like being the plan B. I don't think it's very fair. The page scrolled down enough that I can't see how much time has passed. I'm thinking maybe like 5 minutes. Does this thing stop when it's 20 minutes?  Now my roommate is writing something. My foot kind of hurts where my shoe rubbed on the way to psychology class. Probably wasn't a smart choice of shoes. Oh well. I wonder when that water bottle is from. Yesterday I think. My printer has a blue button. I'm getting kind of bored of this and I don't really like to type. I hate e-mail and instant message and all that garbage. Why can't people just call you on the phone?  It's so much easier and then you hear the tone in their voice and know if they're being sarcastic or not. Sarcasm is completely lost in the electronic communication system thingy. Now I'm staring at the wall. It's a painted brick kind of wall, which is probably smart of whoever designed this place, but it sucks if you want to hang stuff up. We tacked a bunch of posters up everywhere. My best friend Kristyn got a bunch of them for me. Too bad she is not here. We're going out to dinner tomorrow night, no the night after. Anyway, Friday night is when we're going out to dinner. I haven't seen her in a week, which I'm sure doesn't sound like a long time, but she used to be my neighbor when I lived at my parents house so I'm still kind of used to seeing her everyday. She is going to go to massage therapy school somewhere around here. I always forget the name of it, but it's supposed to be not very far away from campus. Now my hand is starting to hurt from typing all this crap. I think if I reread this, I'd probably think I was crazy. All of this is pretty random. I want the phone to ring because now I'm in the mood to talk to him. He is not very nice sometimes, but sometimes he really is. I think this is probably a bad situation. He wants us to be friends. He is a good friend, he is just not very good at being anything more than friends. He is not a very good people person I guess. My roommate is rolling around in her bed, it's kind of distracting. I have a pencil from the greensheet and I don't remember where I got or who could have possibly left it here. Where did it come from?  Do people actually read the greensheet?  I've never seen someone reading it. Kinda weird. My mom works for the Austin American Statesman, but she doesn't write or take pictures or anything like that, she works in HR. Time must be almost up. Ha, it does tell me when this is over! "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now I just sat down to type this psychology paper. This is the first time I have ever typed a paper like this before, with constant writing. I am used to gathering my thoughts, thinking before I speak but now I am writing whatever pops into my mind. I am thinking about how much this different from something I would do in high school; being able to submit a paper via the internet that is amazing. I am hearing the faint sound of the Houston Astros baseball game in the background, I love baseball so much, this the pennant races are incredible. Hopefully I will  get to broadcast the game I love in the future. Well I have an hour until its time to go to work, its nice that the clock is ticking down on my first major writing assignment of college. Astros, I think still losing 3-2 someone just flied out. I'm enjoying the fact that I am able to do this from my own computer, god I would hate to live in a dorm. Sharing and small places are no fun for me. Looking forward to this weekend, big barbecue put on by my friend Mike; we always have legendary times at those. Its just starting to sink in now as I hear God Bless America in the background that today is September 11. It's hard to believe that our country was attacked only two years ago, it seems at least to me that it happened an eternity ago. I really don't agree with what is going on in our country right now, by the way. The wind is blowing pretty good outside right now, for some reason I have not opened the blinds in the house yet. I get really lazy when I am at home. Anyway, this a little easier than I thought it would be. It has really gotten me thinking. I mean how often do we really pay attention to what we are thinking, and are we thinking about something all the time? Consciously? Well I think we got our lead off man on in the 8th we are still down 3-2, I really hope we don't lose to Milwaukee. Man I don't want to go to work today, although 4-9:30 is not that bad, better than 12-9:30. I feel like I am writing in a journal more than doing a project, that is cool that there is actually a clock at the top of the page. Big props to the person who set that up. I was actually considering putting a stopwatch next to me for this assignment, but I quickly realized that was not necessary. I just found out I have discussion section class for geography. I don't get that if you understand the material why do you need a discussion section? I don't get what that is all about, is it for the TA's to feel important or something? Must be a college thing, I guess. It seems like a lot of this stuff is over my head right now. I just quickly glanced at the clock and saw that I have about a minute left. I hope I did alright on this, I mean I wrote what came into my head and luckily avoided any sick and twisted thoughts. P. S (I submitted the paper erroneously earlier today under the wrong class code. My class code is 316 not 315) "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm starting to feel tired and lazy. That sandwich for lunch really hit the spot and now I feel really comfortable as I sit in this chair and look at the screen. I feel somewhat hypnotized and just relaxed. I feel like taking a nap because the temperature is slightly warm and it is making me slow down. I'm thinking about going to gregory but I feel so relaxed that I probably won't go. Its such a long walk and then I have to come back to my room before I go to another class. I wish my dorm room was closer to Gregory, then I think I would go more often. Instead I always tell myself I'm going to go but most of the time I just put it off. My back is sore and I think I need to stretch it, my legs are also sore. I know it has to be from all the walking in between classes. I can't wait for tonight. Monday night football. My night to sit on the couch and watch TV. I wonder who is playing. I think its the eagles and Bucaneers, but I'm not sure. I think the Bucaneers have a real good shot of repeating and winning the super bowl again this year. I know for sure the Cowboys are going to be bad. They will finish around 6 to 7 wins. If they win more, it will be a successful year for them. I wonder where my roommate is. He always leaves the lights on in our room, so I know he has been home and left already. I really wish I was done for the rest of the day and didn't have another class. I would definitely take a nap. Naps are so key. They are rejuvenating beyond anything else. My hair is always in my eyes. I think its time for me to finally get it cut. Its annoying now, its too hot to have long hair in my face. Also it looks kind of shaggy. I'm taking my shoes off. That feels better. ooh. that blister on the bottom of my foot looks pretty bad. ill have to put another band aide on it. I need to start playing basketball more so I won't get blisters when I just play on occasions. The only problem is that there are usually too many people that want to play, so I never get the chance to practice my shot. So in the games I end up missing most of the time. Fortunately the competition is not real high at Gregory. Although I have seen Brian Boddicker and Sidwell Harris up there at times. I can't believe the basketball coach would allow them to play in pickup games like that. What if they got hurt? He would be infuriated. How would you tell the coach that you broke your ankle and were out for the season just because you were in some stupid pickup game. Does not sound right. You know what else is not right, Chance Mock starting t quarterback. Texas's offense is so predictable with Chance at QB. Run Cedrick Benson up the middle once or twice for minimal yardage and then we are in a third and long and everybody in the stadium knows we have to throw it. That is when Chance gets sacked or throws an incomplete pass and we have to punt it. On the other hand when Vince Young is at QB, you can't predict what is going to happen. He is much more of a threat. He can run, scramble, elude tacklers and throw also, at least that is what he did against New Mexico St. I know its the aggies of New Mexico St. that we played last week but he did better than Chance Mock against the same guys. So I think he deserves the start against Arkansas this upcoming week. I can't wait to rub it into Mic's face when we beat them. I hope he finds a ticket and can come down from Arkansas for the game. He will definitely be intimidated by the Texas crowd. How long has it been since I have done my laundry?  Not since I left home I think. I really don't want to do laundry in my dorm room. It takes too long. I think I'm just going to take all my dirty clothes with me whenever I go home. Probably around homecoming, which is the same weekend as the Texas OU game. I can't believe I didn't get a ticket for that. That really pisses me off. I did get lucky though with my season tickets, section 20 row 7, right behind the cannon. That was a pretty good draw for a freshman. Still, Ill have to find a way to get a ticket to the Texas OU game. Best game all year in all of college football and we better win this year or else Mack Brown should be fired. That would be the fourth year in a row. He can recruit like its nobody's business but he can't develop that talent and fit them into a game plan that can make us win the big game. Straight up he gets out coached every time by Bob Stoops. What a stud. My fingers are getting a little tired from typing. "
Tell me about yourself.,"It is really bright in here. Maybe I should turn on of the lights off. I would except I'm writing a stream of consciousness. I really miss Byron. I just talked to him about 10 minutes ago, but I need to talk to him again. Boy, is my cell phone bill going to be high this month. Haha. I still haven't paid mom for last months bill. I probably should have read chapter 3 before starting this, since it is due tomorrow and this isn't due until the 12th, but I would more than likely had waiting until the last minute if I hadn't gotten this over now. Whoops. My poster looks like it is about to fall down. Oh well, I'm to tired to go and put it back up. Yet, I am still awake enough to sit here and type for 20 minutes. I wonder how much people write for this if they are slow typers. And I wonder if they read every one of these. Especially since mine is going to be so long because of my typing speed. Man, if I were a slow typer this would be a lot less work. And if I wasn't so diligent about punctuation, capitalization, and spelling. Haha. Instead of spelling I accidentally wrote sleeping and had to erase it. I wonder if that is my subconscious trying to tell me something. I'm so glad I finished that photo wall. It turned out really nice, but Stephanie didn't seem to like it too much because she didn't have quite as many pictures as I did to put up. Oh well, that's her problem. Man, my DVD's are really out of order. I'm not sure why I think they need to be in any order at all, because in the grand scheme of things, that really doesn't matter quite that much. You know what would really suck would be if my computer, out of the blue caught a virus while I was in the middle of this, and I would have to start all over again. Then I would just wait until the last minute and probably not type quite so much. Oh well, this is for science I guess. Man I really really miss Byron. I can't believe I got so upset today when I was driving home, but what can you do when you love somebody so much. I don't know how his brother is related to him, he is so strange. At least he is nice I guess. I wonder if his blindness was caused from his genes or from some other problem when he was born. I guess that really isn't my business, but I'm just so damn curious. Byron didn't seem to know, so I guess I'll never find out unless I ask him, and I don't know him quite well enough to do that. Man, my pinky is really starting to cramp up. I don't think I've written for 8 minutes straight before without taking a break. I hope my Calculus quiz tomorrow isn't bad, I did the homework and everything and my professor swears that it is enough preparation for his quizzes, but yet I still remain cynical. I guess I'll just go over the homework problems again before I go to sleep. I can't wait until that Royal's show comes on A and E. Wow, I was so lazy I didn't even bother to find the and symbol. Haha. I did it again. If I wasn't on this laptop I wouldn't have a problem finding it. I wish it came with a 10 key pad. Byron. Byron. I can't stop thinking about that boy. He is such a sweet heart, and I can't wait to finish college so I can spend all my time with him. I wonder where A & E is. Haha. I found the & symbol. I wonder if there is some way that I can find out the channels on the internet through UT's website. Man this is a hell of a lot of typing. Hey hey, I see my Monkees bobble heads. They are so strangely entertaining. That's the only reason why I'm going to watch the A&E special, (davy jones is on it wahoo). That, and because Byron said he was going to watch it. There's the picture I have of us!  I can't stop looking at it or thinking about him!  I'm sure whoever (if anyone) reads this will wonder who Byron is (though it's pretty obvious). I hope Archie allows him to stay over at his dorm so he can come visit next weekend, and I don't have to drive back to San Antonio again. I don't mind driving down there, it might just be nice to have a change of scenery and have Byron visit up here. I'm going to be so worried about him though because he has to wait until he gets off of work to drive up here. There are to many drunk people out on the street for him to be safe, even though I trust his driving abilities. I think I'll have him call periodically on his way up here, just so I know that he is alright. Ya, that's a good idea. I should probably go and put those batteries into my remote but I don't want to get up and find it, nor am I suppose to get up from this typing and do something else. Man, Steph drank all my Hi-C. Or did I drink it all?  Naw. Steph did. I distinctly remember having at least 2 left in there when I left on Thursday. I don't drink her stuff. Oh wait, I did but she told me I could have some. Man, that whip cream I got on my face earlier from the Frappacino still hasn't come off after washing my face twice. I can still smell it. Eww. It smells like babies vomit. Byron!  Why aren't you here with me right now!  I know why you aren't here, but I wish you were!  Someday I won't have to worry about where you are all the time, and wonder what you are doing, but for right now this is torture!  Especially since I am writing all my thoughts down, and these thoughts of you are more obvious to me than normal!  All the thought I have in-between are meaningless because I don't consciously notice them, but when I'm thinking about you it takes all my concentration and full attention!  I should probably try and not think about missing you during class, but I can't stop. IT isn't like I don't mind these ideas, I just know that I won't be paying attention to what I should be. Hurray I'm almost out of time. 19 minutes. and a few seconds. Steph needs to put her stuff away and keep it away from my side of room. What is up with this. I'm not going to clean up after her. I'm getting so annoyed with her sleeping habits, but what can I do. I love you Byron!  I want to drive up there right now but I can't because of class! "
Tell me about yourself.,"this is my first writing assignment. I'm watching cosby on tv. I have a headache. I've had a headache most of today. I woke up and was still dead tired even after 8 hours of sleep. I had a stomach ache and felt like I was going to be sick. I had a headache and didn't feel like doing anything. so I got back in bed for a little bit. then went over to the san jac food place for some oj. that worked out pretty good I think for breakfast. I think from now on on mwf I'll just go to san jac for some oj and walk to calculus. that class is going pretty good. I was supposed to have a study group tonight but I called everyone and nobody could go. so that was kinda stupid since even the girl who set it up couldn't make it. but I don't really need it. I think I'll be doing more teaching than learning in that study group. I had calculus in high school but got a 3 on the AP test so I'll take calculus over again and learn the stuff better since I'm an ee major and will really need to know the stuff. I was thinking about switching majors to psych cause I really enjoyed everything I learned in high school when I took it. I don't know if I'll switch over though yet. I'm liking me ee302 and 306 classes so we'll just see where the year goes. all day I've felt like crap and I miss my best friend mariko so much. especially today since I've felt bad. she always makes me feel better. it's really tough being here at college 2 1/2 hours away from her and only being able to see her every couple of weeks. I'd come home every weekend if I had my car up here but my mom didn't let me bring my car up this year. I'd pay for the parking permit and everything but she said it's not part of the college experience. I don't care about the experience. I'm here to learn and I do that during the week. I do all my homework when I need to during the week and then nothing on the weekends. so why can't I come home and spend my time with the one person I want to spend time with. well I know people here that have offered me rides so I can get a ride home every couple weeks to see mariko. my mom was mad this past weekend cause I spent most of my time with mariko. and my mom said she didn't bring me home just to hang out with her. well from now on I'll get rides home from other people so I can spend my time with who I want since my mom won't be wasting her time driving and getting me. I feel bad for thinking that, but that's just how I feel. I love my mom and everything, but I'm not really close to her at all, and I've been introduced to religion through mariko and mariko has always made me feel better no matter what and she is always helped me through anything. and I am completely comfortable around mariko and feel completely at ease. I'm so close to mariko and I love her so much and it's just hard being away from her. she goes to japan every summer with her family. I've been thinking about going next summer. I'd have to talk with her parents about that though. but that would cost me about 1000 dollars for the ticket and I'd have to stay with mariko's family in japan otherwise I wouldn't be able to afford a hotel for a month. so that would cost me a ton of money, and then I've been thinking about going on a mission for the church also. I really want to go. my mom's really against the religion I've joined. she is just heard too many things that aren't true. and I hate how she feels. but through religion I've learned how to deal with all these feelings and I'm comforted now and I forgive my mom for how she feels because she just doesn't know any better. I'm kind of tired and I still have a headache. I want something to drink. the vending machines at the building were all sold out last time I checked, and right now I don't want to walk back down there 2 floors to find out. I don't' feel like a sprite either, I could go down to san jac again. I think they're closed though. my shoulders have been hurting lately. my neck really hurts too. my neck just started today. but my shoulders have been hurting for a while. usually after sitting in a class after an hour. I need to move around more or something I guess. my hands are freezing cold. there's no thermostat in my room so it's always freezing. and coming in from a hot day it feels good but waking up in the morning it is freezing cold and I can't stand it. I put up another bulletin board over my bed and some push lights on the ceiling over my bed. one of the push lights came off last night or the other night and I put it up again so hopefully it all stays up. there were already some damages to the ceiling so I guess I won't be charged for anything. the sticky things that aren't supposed to mess up walls messed up the ceiling some. but I don't think it matters. oh well. I have some pictures of mariko up on my bulletin boards around the rooms. some on the bulletin board over my bed. I like waking up with pictures of mariko right there. I miss her so much. I hope she had a good day today. last night she didn't seem to be talking too much but she was doing a lot of homework. I don't know. sometimes she just goes through phases. I wish I could help her more but there's not much I can do. she just needs to learn to love herself and know that she is a good person and that she is loved. sometimes it just gets tough for her. and that's a whole other reason I want to be home still. so I can be there with her physically to help her feel better when she is down. we still talk online all the time and I call sometimes. it's hard to find times to call though. either she will have band till 530 or church or school during the day and then I have classes at certain times so I can't just leave and call her. but I'm going to try and find a couple times a week to call. tomorrow's thursday already so I don't think I'll get a couple calls in this week. I'll call on the weekend though since I won't be going home this weekend. hopefully I meet some people at church this weekend and at the friday lunch and speaker thing at the institute. I seem to be the youngest person there. and I'm already not a talkative person, so I think it's going to be kinda hard to meet people. oh well. 10 seconds left for this thing. hopefully the rest of the year goes well. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I hear the innumerable conversations buzzing in the background. Why do I constantly attempt to erase my sentences until I get it perfect. I smell nothingness. I should be smelling the moist air of post-raining. But instead, I only hear the faint taps of water breaking. I Love College, by the way. And that weird survey you have us take, pretesting, is the most hilarious thing to experience. That survey is so subjective to what you feel at the current moment. Damn, my fingers are already cramping. Must pop now. It doesn't want to. Let's see, how was my day?  It was long. It was tiring. OU. Damn game. But it turned out to be a nice little long wait with a dear little friend. Nothing beats flirting from 8 am to daytime. Can I say tits. Oh, what the fuck. It feels nice cussing when it is clearly inappropriate to do so for a grade. But, this is what I'm thinking, and to begrudge me for following instructions repudiates the process. Whoa, I like when I talk intellectually. I like when I can say that I like talking intellectually without fear of conceit, because no one is here to judge you other than an anonymous psycho analyzer. That was a long word. Shit, only 8 gone. It feels like a space of time has gone. I miss my adorable niece. She is the absolutely most beautiful human being. I could sincerely cry at the thought of her pure sweet charm. But I won't lest I go deep into a melancholic cheer. Whoa, there I go again. You know, it took me a long time to find the website to do this assignment. There is no emphasis on the paper to reference it's significance. No highlights. No italicizing. I cannot believe how long this experiment is. I want to eat. But I really don't. It's called munchies. And I like food. It's them damn dopamine's. I tell you, for food of course. You better have gotten that play on words, or you're not an astute psychologist. Now I'm talking to someone, which makes me a what?  I really don't know. That's your job. I'm just thinking what it would be like to be on the other end of this letter. This weird letter of nonsensical discussion to a nonexistent second party. Impatience is the motif of this letter. I can't finish it. I enjoy doing this writing but nonetheless want it to end, isn't that contradictory?  That's a rhetorical question. I like psychology. It's particularly fun for a writer/slightly intellectual. I would like to minor in it. Just for the pure knowledge. Sorry, I had to answer my phone. She says, my baby, I love you,"" and I say, ""I'm typing"". She goes on asking questions, inconsequential chatting ones. She forgot to eat with her friend. Aw, poor chica. She says she felt like a dildo. Shit just happens, probably too much. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am typing this paper because I have to. My roommate is asleep. I am listening to Incubus music. I am listening to Incubus. I just got off the phone with my girlfriend. She was annoying me. She was saying all this stuff about how I was flirting with this fat girl. And I was like what I did not flirt with the fat girl. And we went back and forth and it was a stupid argument. But in the end we worked it out and we are still cool together and it is all good. The music I am listening to is so good I love listening to them. I am so mad. I did  my Calculus homework tonight and I missed a few problems. It makes me angry because my roommate and I both know Calculus and I should have gotten them all right. I missed a few which was stupid, but I corrected them. But still it makes me mad because the grading system is so stupid. If you keep guessing a question and get it wrong you get negative points. Which makes no sense because then you could get a negative one hundred instead of a maximum one hundred which means that you could get a -100 to a 100 which makes no sense. I am so mad at this stupid grading system. Because then I can get negative points and it will still make my grade negative but it will still hurt it a lot. I am really in a bad mood because our shower flooded tonight and so we have to call maintenance and they have to come and fix it. And I messed up on my homework so it is not a good night. I cannot wait for this week to be over. I am having a bad week. The song I am listening to now is really good and it is motivating me to type. I really have to go to the bathroom. I wish I could go. Oh well, the music is good. I really like this writing assignment because I can write about whatever I want. I wish all writing assignments were like this. It is so cool to be able to write about anything. I love writing about what I am thinking, it is almost like a diary. It is good to be able to write about my feelings, I think this assignment is very good. I hope my girlfriend is not mad, I just thought about that. We talked tonight, and I think she might be mad with some of the stuff that I told her. I really hope she is not because I love her with all my heart, I hope she is nor going to blow anything  "
Tell me about yourself.,this is one of the most interesting assignments I've had. Frisbee tomorrow I'll be late. I'm homesick and a bad typer is that the right word oh well All my friends and family enjoying themselves without me (sigh) this getting used to college is a little more difficult than I imagined but I guess that I always have trouble starting something new my legs are tired I ran 4 miles and played Frisbee When I started elementary school I cried and clung to my dad's leg Ican't remember middle school Funny how I can remember something farther away than something more recent maybe elementary was more traumatic. Then high school I got really tiny because I think I had a nervous stomach I can hear the girl next to me' s headphones It must be a foreign language We have to do that in French I'm finally getting hungry I thought I never would I need to work out more It is kind of depressing to have once worked out on a team five days a week twice a day with a whole bunch of people now I have to make myself do stuff that is not as fun I go by myself to the gym and to swim at least I found frisbee except they're a little more advanced than me but the practices aren't a s strenuous and as frequent as my old swim practices My room mates sick puking all night I keep washing my hands and the door knob every thing she touches It makes me nervous when people are sick I don't want to catch it and get my life off schedule I mean heck it just got into some kind of routine then I'd go and get sick miss class miss practice and have to get the notes from someone and not fall to far behind that makes me nervous  I used to get sick all the time when I swam every winter I would get some kind of 5- 7 day flu and it would usually mess everything up My training for the meets especially I was so frustrated sometime s I would try and convince myself I wasn't sick and I would just keep going as if nothing was wrong and then bam I couldn't do it any longer I would be so weak and tired I had just made it worse Nothing like making a problem even worse Only three minutes to go and I'm hungry I think I will have an apple they taste mmmm I like to eat fruit I had a boyfriend that pretty much didn't eat fruit or vegetable he liked mashed potatoes and gravy chicken fried steak and all that stuff is fine but you have to balance or your going to die to soon probably unless you have good genes people should take care of themselves         
Tell me about yourself.,"hmmmm, I wonder how many people I a m going to meet , some persons painting her toe nails, what color? red I think not looking     I'm hearing this guy and girl talk about classes. I thought all my classes seemed pretty hard but there not. so I think I have back problems. used to wrestle, do weights now, can't squat though, back hurts to much, these beds suck ass, jesters at least. I just got a blanket, a feathered blanket, its pretty nice. Oh, and I also got some new blue sheets, I think I want to go to sleep, but I can't cause I can't go to sleep. Woah! I'm so glad I only need to do this for twenty minutes, these are all random sentences and the punctuation all wrong and I am so behind on my readings for your class. Cedric Bensons in my first class. I have noticed I don't like raising my hand because I'm afraid of being wrong. Making out in public, that is just bad karma. I met these real pretty girls but for some reasons I only want to be everyone's friend. I need an envelope, I need to pay rent wow I like nintendo, the games, how simple they are. I'm going to join the HBSA. it seems pretty interesting but I don't know about 60 bucks. COLLEGE IS SO COOL, some of these dorms smell bad though. Not as bad as my house though cause I left the stove on overnight and the whole apartment smelt like burnt pizza. I'm so tired of working. I want to stop this timer right now though. I need to pay rent. wondering if my breath smells. posters, I need a poster. something blue. laredo. I hate girls, sometimes, I guess really I'm just jealous cause they get a lot of stuff handed to them just because they are women. I want to go to the beach again, or at least move back to california. sometimes I think I am losing my mind, but then I take a few breathes. I also want to join wrestling, maybe rugby when I am older. I need to clean my room. I bought candles and I think I need the buy some more things. I have enough food though. hungry, hungry, hungry. Apartments are awesome. mannnnnnnnn. twenty minutes, this stuffs easy when you have something to write about or not when you have nothing to write. (sigh) "
Tell me about yourself.,"So I'm a little nervous because I don't know what to do about my fig meeting today. I'm supposed to have it at 3:30, but last week no one was there. I can't decide if I want to go back  out into the heat or just skip it. I wonder if it can count against you if you skip a fig meeting. I feel so stupid about being nervous to email the instructor. I am so excited about this wrist band thing. I wonder who I will go with to the OU game. I can't believe it is so soon. I'm freaking out. I hope I get a date. Lets see. I promised to get me, Patty, and Kelly a ticket so I can get three more for other people. I can't believe I am actually seventh in line. I hope the guy wasn't tricking me or lying to me because then I would feel really stupid since I've told a lot of people. Oh well. I don't even know what to right on these things. I really wish I was taking a nap right now. My thoughts don't flow as easily when I am being forced to right about them. And I really don't want to say something that could some how embarrass me. although I do that enough anyways. hmmmmm. This class seems like its going to be really hard. I am so confused about what my major should be. Why in the world did I choose advertising when I really don't think I have any interest in it at all. I wonder if its ok that I'm not capitalizing my I's"". I'm so used to instant message typing. it gets hard to used apostrophes and capitalize words. oh well. I hope my cousin is doing ok at her new school. I feel so bad that I haven't talked to my parents so much since I've been here. I don't know if I have even called them twice. That makes me sad, I just feel like I don't have any time. Man , I really want some Kerby queso. maybe I'll get some later. I need to get this printer fixed if I want to be able to print anything out. Dang it. I wonder if I need to print out a confirmation sheet for this. Wait that is just for the pretesting. which was extremely long. I wonder if we can backspace on this thing. hah. I'm so excited about this weekend's ""white trash party"" my phone is ringing. I wonder if I should pick it up huh. I guess Ill just let it ring and listen to the answering machine and see if it is someone important. dial tone. ok and now my cell phone is ringing. ill just look and see who it is. of course its patty. its always Patty. I can't believe I got a yellow wrist band!  Its so awesome. It really annoys me how I always press the Caps Lock button when I'm typing. I think I do it like once a minute. I must be the worst typer in the world. It really grosses me out to find my roommate's hair all over my floor. I don't know why she can't just pick up the dust buster once in a while. Oh I need to unlock my door so patty can get in. Oh well, next year's living arrangements will  be better. But that really stresses me out! I can't believe  I have to get my roommates together like before October. How do you even know who are your good friends yet. Well at least I will be with Kelly. I wonder if Patty is going to want to room with us or if she is just going to want to get her own group to room with. I'm sad Kristin is not going to get an apartment. I don't know why she wants to be an RA. It just seems like way too much responsibility. Oh well. Man I'm hungry , and it is a long long time till dinner. That sucks. Oh good, I thought I lost my Advertising syllabus. but its on my desk that is good. OH yah, I have to go do study hours tonight. That is good. That means I don't have to do my homework now. Maybe I can get in a little nap. Or maybe I should see if my fig is meeting today. I really should work out some. I have totally fallen off track on my working out. It totally stresses me out that I'm probably going to gain like the freshman 45. That is going to sucks. Oh well at least its better than being 85 pounds like last year. Maybe I shouldn't write that on this. Oh well, I tell everybody anyways. I just have like absolutely no motivation to work out. They are right about one thing. Gregory might be close, but your bed is so much closer. I hope my parents aren't like shocked when they see me again. lol. Where is Patty. She called like five minutes ago and it definitely doesn't take that long to ride the elevator 4 floors. Maybe she wanted me to bring her down my book. I need to tell her I will need it tonight during study hours. She will probably be upset. Its my book though. I really need to put away some of this clean laundry. What am I going to wear at the White Trash party. I don't know if I really have anything for that. I guess I should go to Walmart and get a wife beater or something trashy like that. I really want to wear a trucker hat. Ill borrow one. Okay here she is. F "
Tell me about yourself.,"Okay so I'm just going to start typing. Cough Cough I wonder how I got sick. Did I catch something from Joe because he was sick last week but maybe it was from sleeping with the fan on high. Oh well I'm feeling better today than I was before. Wow it hasn't even been two minutes yet. How am I going to keep thins up for twenty?  Oh well at least it doesn't really matter what I type. I wish I knew how to type faster. I have to slow my brain down to get my fingers to keep up. Stupid geometry book. I hope that I did my homework proofs right. Thanks so much Mr. Knight for not making me do proofs in high school geometry. I'm really not an orange juice fan, but I have to drink it so that I can tell John that I did so he won't worry about me not getting enough vitamin C with my cold. Ooh I need to plug my cell phone in I think it's about to die. I'm really glad I called Mama today on the bus ride home. I miss her. I wonder what I should get her for her birthday. It seems like it was her birthday just yesterday. This year went by super fast. Six minutes down fourteen to go. I'm starting to get hungry. What do I want for dinner tonight?  I kind of want to order some chicken wings but I shouldn't they're to fattening and we have tons of food here. I should make something. maybe I'll just heat up some chicken and dumplings. That would feel good on my throat. That tomato soup I had the other day was really good too, even if it was hill country fair or whatever that crazy generic HEB brand is. I miss Brookshire's and good old Hi Top brand. Nobody here has even heard of Brookshire's. I guess it's because their all from Houston. Fuck Houston. Houston is not Texas. People who say they've been to Texas but have only been to Houston haven't been to Texas. Any way doo doo doo dooty doo. I'm seriously running out of thoughts to type. cough cough I need to go to John's to get my Roubatusin. I'm fairly certain that's not how you spell that but oh well I never claimed to know how to spell anything. Today I saw this girl over near the MLK statue with food in her hands holding it out to the birds and she let pigeons and grackles land on her hand and eat out of it. Not only let them but wanted them to. I had to laugh because I realized that girl must not know shit about shit"" to quote the Daily Show. Only five more minutes woo hoo. Let's see when I'm done here I should work on my Spanish homework but I think instead I'll fill in my new uncalandar. I was so excited when I found it at the co-op today. I had one last year and I loved it. Then I went back this year and I couldn't find them. When I saw them today I bought two in case they didn't have them again when I go to buy school supplies next August. Okay two and a half more minutes. I wonder if I should stop in mid sentence when tim is up or finish my thought. Did it say that in the instructions and I wasn't paying attention?  Oh well I'll cross that bridge when I get there. I can't believe I forgot to print the confirmation page for my pretesting  I hope I get that credit  That was one of the most boring experiences of my life I would hate to think it was all for nothing. Or naught as John would say. "
Tell me about yourself.,"As I look at my clock in the lower right hand corner it says 12:26AM on September 11. I am taking this time to reflect on the events that occurred to years ago. They still should strike a painful memory in every Americans life. I remind myself to take nothing for granted because it could end at any unexpected moment. I also feel a little stress with all of the homework that college brings along with it. Austin is so much different than my hometown of Lubbock, and it is taking me a while to get adjusted to it. However, I have absolutely loved the first three weeks of my tenure here so far. I cannot wait to say that I am a graduate of the University of Texas. That will mean so much to me and my family, since it will be an amazing accomplishment. I just remembered that my laundry basket is full, and I need to do that sometime before Friday since I may be leaving town for a Pat Green concert. Hopefully, the laundry room at the end of my floor, 6th in Jester West, will not be full. Surely I can get caught up on all of my reading by this weekend and be able to enjoy it to the fullest without worrying about school homework that I did not complete. I sure hope I can adjust to college as well as I have set my goals. My roommates are out of the room right now, and I am reminded how well it is to concentrate without them in here. They are both from Lubbock also, and I have been friends with them for about 6 years. My parents called today and it is very important to me to tell them how much I appreciate them paying for me to come down here. I know it is hard on them to adjust to my absence, but me and them know it is for the best. I am convinced that the Business program at UT will set me up for a very successful life. My hands and forearms are starting to ache from typing continuously, and my eyes are starting to close. I feel like falling asleep, but I know how much work I still have left to do. For some reason, I get most of my work done around or after midnight. It helps that I don't have a class until 10 on MWF and 12 on TTH. I am looking forward to meeting some girls this weekend and possibly trying out a new church. It is important to me to find a church in Austin and not forget the ways from which I was raised. Many people believe UT is so liberal that every student comes out weird, but I believe there is something for everyone in Austin. I have already met so many people just like me, and it is awesome. By far I can tell that college will be the best time of my life. The only thing I wish I could change is the dorm food. I am  getting so tired of chicken every meal. I do not like oriental food or the hamburgers that they serve that basically limits it to chicken. Well the saying goes, everything tastes like chicken anyways. Maybe next year I can get an apartment with some of the new people that I meet and possibly the guys from Lubbock too. I am trying to figure out why my email is not working. It keeps making me re-log in and it is really getting annoying. Oh well, two more days to the weekend. Arkansas comes in town this weekend so it should be a fun game. I saw some of the football players today. Wow, they are so huge. They are like a different breed of people. I want psychologists to study their genes and see how they get so big. I know it is some sort of phenomenon or something. I figured out that in 2 minutes I have to find something new to do so I am already brainstorming. I wish every paper was this easy. English papers are so analytical and this is just what is on my mind. It could go on forever. I never have to stop and think. Dell: what an amazing company. How does someone without a college education make so much money?  I hope my college education will lead me to success like that. Well, time is up. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I really want to go take a nap but I can't because I have so much work to do. That's how it's been since rush started. Rush was when I really started feeling like my life was going through some changes that I didn't know if I could handle. Now that's it's over and now that school is underway, the stress doesn't seem to be going anywhere. I always heard that college would be super stressful but never realized that what people were referring too wasn't necessarily just the school work. I thought I was SO prepared to come to UT, and I guess based on my high school education I am, but I was not ready for trying to mix sorority and social life (one in which they expect you to go out every night) with school and my goal of a 4. 0. Now, for one of the first times, it feels like I'm not going to be able to reach my goal. I am so worried about it. I already know what I want to do with my life, and that just makes it more stressful, because I know what I need to do to get there. Oh well. I don't know what to do about Trey. He is my boyfriend, or actually we're on a break because he wants me to feel no extra pressure of feeling like I owe him time while I figure out UT and while I get situated with everything. I didn't know someone could care about me the way he does. And its so weird now because we always knew it would come to this and it just never seemed like it would matter. I guess nobody really knows what to expect. I spend more of my time helping other people and trying to make everyone in the world happy, that a lot of times I forget that my  happiness is important too. I guess that's why me not feeling the need to make time for Trey has been good for me. It gives me less stress, but it feels like more is missing than just him. In everything I do I put my everything into it. So just knowing that I am missing opportunities to make him happy and even to make my parents happy by taking time to go have lunch with them, is tearing me up. This week my goal is to try to squeeze in school work and stuff, but also I am going to go to every social thing this week. I really want to make sure I give this sorority thing time to show why everyone who is in it, is so in love with it. My mom is real pushy about it. And my brother. I don't think anyone in my family realizes that my brother and I are two different people. I am not a partier, but we'll see I guess. I just really want to get good grades so I can choose where I want to go to medical school. My brother had to go to law school in Lubbock because he didn't get in to UT's. He was upset. I want to dictate my own future and where I want to go. I just took that pretesting survey a few minutes ago and I thought it was interesting the variety of questions they asked. I have a huge fear that someone is in the backseat of my car ALL the time. Well, only at night, like when I get in it after I've been inside or at someone else's house. I guess it's better safe than sorry, but it gets old. I don't know if that fear was there before I heard about my mom or if it just got worse after it. My mom has been through some stuff that I can't even imagine, and that I didn't find out about until this year. That would be weird, determining when your kids are old enough to tell them about certain things. Like her mom. My mom's mom was my favorite person in the world. She was always smiling and happy and genuinely kind to and interested in everyone around her, especially strangers. I found out also recently that she went through a long depression spell and when my mom was younger got electroshock therapy that changed her life. It hurt me when I found out about that because it seemed that I was in love with a different woman because it supposedly changed her personality dramatically. I don't really even know much about it. I really hope trey finds something he loves in this world. I really wish I knew how to motivate him. He told me the other night that he feels like a loser around mje sometimes, even though he is not at all. He is taking classes at ACC, where there isn't much school involvement or much room or making new friends. I'm at UT taking 16 hours, with goals and ambitions and a new social life and a new school to be excited about. I really can't imagine us not staying together but we've been through so much and it really seems like we are perfect for one another, it has since the first day. I get really sick of people saying I'm too young to know. Maybe I am, but I am a strong believer in finding things out for myself. I always have been. I miss high school sports a lot. That's where I got a lot of my self-esteem from. Those underclassmen and everyone looked up to me so much. I know that I am changing here, even though it hasn't really been new for very long, and I just hope I remember who I was when all this is said and done. I like myself and I don't' ever want to be just a person in the masses. I don't think I'm doing this free-write right. I don't think its supposed to be as much about my personal life. I just really have a lot on my mind, and I guess everyone else does too. I have to go eat dinner before I go get dressed for tonight so I'm glad the time is almost up. It almost feels better just to write everything down. I used to do that a lot. Write out my thoughts whenever I was stressed or upset. Now I'm so stressed I don't even have time to do that. Car rides are just about the only time I have to myself. Or when I'm working out. That's always nice, until it ends and I have to go to class all sweaty. I feel sorry for the people that have to sit by me after that! "
Tell me about yourself.,"wow I really need to shower but I'm going to go work out later so that is ok. maybe tim will come and abbey and mike, they would be so cute. I don't know though but I'm glad tim called me yesterday. the flowers aunt michelle sent me are getting old where should I put them, I guess in the waste basket thing by the stairs. I wish I could use those but every time I go down for lunch you can't get in from that staircase, its annoying. I'm really hungry. I was not supposed to eat the snickers and kit kats but I mean I practically had vegetables for lunch so its ok, plus its the weekend soon and I don't want to waste it. I forgot to go draw my tickets, I never know when to go. I should look it up soon but I can't go now because sunny and abbey have not given me their IDs and its probably too late anyway. and lets see only like an hour till psychology, I want to sleep but ate the candy so I'd stay awake and its working I mean I'm a little tired but not too much. I went to bed around like 1 last night but I wanted to study more, but my roommate was sleeping and she gets mad or annoyed sometimes when I turn on the light, like its a spotlight on her or something. anyway kinda pisses me off and I have to do everything in the dark which takes forever, I have to brush my teeth, take my pills, do my nose drops, lots of stuff. and then she wakes up really early - well she had a class, but she didn't wake up to her alarm and I did. and then when she left it went off again and I still had an hour to sleep before I had to get up to get dressed. it was cool though. my room is nice and clean now, the maid lady came because she forgot to come yesterday. I can't really do this if my roommate is in here, oh well. she is about to come in, I hope I can focus! this is really hard to think of things to say because I have never really paid attention to my stream of consciousness. I don't know if I'll be able to draw my tickets tomorrow because my classes are in the morning and I don't know what time it closes. probably all sold out anyway, so many people here. but its funny because I'm not meeting as many people as I'd like to, but I have only gone to like one frat so. I'm glad I met tim though, that was kind of random and he is really cute. and abbey seems to like mike, who really likes her, and they would be cute too. but abbeys is either changing a lot or living a lie, she goes to frats like 4 times a week, its crazy. and I have been friends wither her for like 10 years so I know she procrastinates so I hope she gets her work done. I don't think she is though because she always says she has hw and then leaves to go party or something, whatever though. we might go get coffee later at barnes n noble, its such a far walk. I don't need coffee either but I think abbey thinks I'm mad at her so I'm going to go anyway and just study I guess. I mean I knew college was a lot of studying but I didn't think it'd be this much. maybe because I'm such a slow reader. I only read about 20 pages per hour. and in the textbook its only 10 per hour. its so slow and so many pages. I finally finished the psychology homework like 2 hours ago, it was sort of interesting but I hope the next chapters are better. I don't think I'm retaining anything. which is bad because I read for so long that you'd think I'd be learning it. I get psychology confused with philosophy and then can't seem to remember either of them. but in class I listen and I get it, then after I try to think about it and all my classes run together. yesterday was especially bad because I got my first grade on a calculus homework assignment. I made a 71 and it really pissed me off because I worked so hard and asked the teacher assistant for help but he gave me the wrong answer and I trusted it. he also didn't do some examples on the board correctly, which made me get another one wrong. today he was all ?oops? yeah it made me mad. but oh well I can drop it according to the syllabus that I don't have printed out. I hope whoever reads this does not think I'm a psycho or anything, or can't spell because its either a typo or I just don't spell well. I really am a good student though and I'm really sad about the calculus hw because it was my very first college grade and I have been waiting for all my hard work to pay off, and it sucked. I was in the bathroom at kerby lane and I cried when I told my dad, I always do that. its good that I have bangs now because if I were to cry or not pluck which I need to do, you can't tell that much. I'm funny about crying, I do it when something really touches my heart, which is kind of often I guess. but pain wise I'm pretty tough, I played basketball for so long. I'm so accident or injury prone. I swear I always get hurt. at the football game that hurt so much when I stepped on that glass I think there was still some in my foot but beth said there was not. it does not hurt anymore so that is alright. I just hope everything goes well for me I mean I really wanted a 4. 0 gpa but now I'm scared. maybe being scared will hinder my performance, so ill stop worrying about it and just trust that I'm smart enough. twenty minutes is almost up.

Tell me about yourself.,"Well I've finally sat down to start writing this and I'm wondering where its going to go. I don't feel like I have a whole lot to say though I'm sure I'll end up babbling for the next 20 minutes. Its rather cold in here. I turned on the air conditioning because it was hot and now its a little too cold. I'm borderline shivering. I suppose that is preferable to sweating constantly though as I expected Texas to be. Feeling pretty hungry as well. I haven't eaten since about 9am. I meant to go get some dinner at Kinsolving around 6pm but lost track of time and now they're closed. Its really annoying how they close so early. Even if I were to go eat at 7pm I'd end up hungry again before I go to bed and eating microwavable dinners doesn't prove particularly satisfying or healthy. This laptop keyboard is being a real pain as I try to type this. I'm not used to it at all because I just got this computer yesterday. My poor typing could also be due to the complete darkness in here, I suppose I should turn some lights on but its kinda nice keeping it cool and dark. My roommate is at his engineering lab right now so its pretty quiet. I'm a bit bored as it is. The whole dorm itself is pretty quiet except for the two guys next to us who feel the need to play guitar and sing (poorly I might add) crappy punk songs. Judging by his volume and consistency I'd venture a guess to say he actually thinks he is pretty good. Unfortunately for him, and all of us who have to endure his endless moaning he is quite the opposite. Oh well, I suppose that is part of dorm life. As I thought I would I've found myself making use of suppose, although, and though a little too often. I think that I think it makes my writing sound smarter or something when it in fact usually ends up diluting my points and making for some long sentences (like this one). I just realized I have yet to break this up into multiple paragraphs which makes it rather hard on the eyes. There's a paragraph break just for style points even though there aren't any of those. Speaking of hurting eyes I'm wondering whether this laptop screen might hurt my eyes after awhile. Its at a rather high resolution but its still fairly clear. I don't feel any eye strain so I'm hoping its a non factor. Unfortunately, the fancy (but cheap) office chair I bought is rather uncomfortable after long periods. And I find myself leaning over the desk in a rather uncomfortable manner, both for my back and neck. Hopefully its something I'll adjust too. In retrospect that paragraph break was a good idea. It makes this look much less like some random ramblings although it would be quite obvious that the contrary was true to anyone who was reading this (you). There I go with the 'although' again. Its really rather annoying. My constant use of rather is also somewhat annoying. For some reason I imagine someone with a British accent saying rather everytime I type it. After I wrote those last few sentences I started thinking of pre-testing and its questions that are meant to probe your inner soul. Which then of course prompted me to wonder how one (you) would analyze my constant annoyance with my own writing style. What does this say about me? I don't know, nor do I care. Although (dammit) I would once again venture a guess and say nothing. Boy time flies when you're babbling and rambling. I was hoping for some synonym there but it wouldn't come to me so I just let it go. Thank god I won't be taking much in the way of English courses the next couple years. Writing weekly papers for the last four years has been tiresome to say the least. I feel a headache coming on now. Probably from staring at the computer screen for the last 2 hours or so. Although (I can't stop myself) I've sat in front of one far longer than that before with no ill effects. I often wish I knew all the weird stuff that goes on in the body so I would know exactly what was happening when something started to ache or twitch or some such thing. I recently found out that the twitching muscles in your leg can be caused by potassium deficiencies (I think I butchered that but I can't be bothered to figure out how to spell it). It actually works out nicely that the only fruit consistently in Kinsolving is bananas although (its unbelievable really) they've been a bit over ripe the last few times I went there. Well down to my last ninety seconds. If you were or are hoping for something even remotely enlightening or insightful well you're just flat out of luck. So I've managed to type random sentences here for the last twenty minutes and its worked out alright. I didn't type out the last two numbers because I didn't want to look for them on the laptop keyboard. And I'm done. Yay. Now for more homework. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I can't stop sniffling. I don't even know if that's how you spell it. I'm so pissed off that I'm getting sick. I guess that's what happens when you live in a dorm. I better not get some crazy disease though. I probably won't. Should I finish my homework? Or should I just pass out. I would prefer to do that latter. My bio 211 class sucks a lot of balls. The professor I think is just TRYING to sound intimidating, and if that is the case, then she is doing a really good job at it. Man, I really really want to be a doctor. I'm not as smart as everyone else. Things don't just come to me. I have to work for it. This may, in the end, work in my favor, being that if I(and hopefully I will)succeed, I will feel all the more complacent. But that's just wishful thinking. I'm really going to stop with the caring about capitalization. when I type emails I never capitalize my I's--well I just did. but that's different. there was this guy I one knew that always made me feel stupid if I didn't spell things right. I know how to spell. and I believe he knew I knew how to spell, but I think he took some kind of pleasure in my feelings of inferiority. perhaps, I will always feel that way when I am around him. well it hasn't stopped for about 5 years now. who would have thought that we would end up at the same university. I mean I know it's not a big deal, being that UT is enormous and all, but he is not going to escape me--I wish I want him to escape me. but I don't. that's not good at all. what a jerk. I mean ok, well he is not really a jerk,"" but I always feel like he is messing with my mind. maybe I'm just the one that's screwed up. I think I am. I'm really glad I didn't seem him today. I needed a break from all that. good break from it right? here I am in my ""stream of consciousness"" talking about it. I don't know if I spelled that C word write either--but who the hell cares right?        wow--I'm really glad it didn't push Finish on me there. sometimes that happens. that would have really sucked because I have already spent 8 min and 47sec typing this. I kinda like typing. it makes me feel pretty cool. thank goodness I'm a fast typer. if I wasn't, things like this would really suck. (I'm trying not to say 'suck balls') --now I'm laughing. I don't know where I got that expression from. maybe it was my sister. yes, yes, I have a TWIN sister. ohhh ahhh. a twin? does she look like you? are ya'll identical?  blah blah. yes yes and no. the end. if I spoke anymore about this and this is in some way published before the class, there would a better hint as to who the writer of this stream of consciousness is. it's alright. not that I mind. I miss my nephew. he is the cutest thing in the world. I miss when he would try to say ""bob the builder. "" what a cutie! he learned to say my boyfriend's name before he learned to say my own name--yeah I was a little upset at first,  but it's really no big deal. I am glad he has a solid man-figure in his life. the boyfriend's a good role model and he obviously loves my nephew very much--oops just sneezed. wow and sorry the phone's ringing. I can't be mean and be like hey I'm typing this stream of consciousness thingy. ok that's over, and I just realized that the spelling of consciousness has been at the heading of this page the whole time. I am a genius. beautiful. well I was spelling it right--that's good. man, sometimes I start to think in spanish. that's cool isn't it. I kinda like that. I wish I could speak fluently though. it would make things a lot a lot easier. I really do want to go to spain. it's on my list of things to do in my life, along with help others, become a pediatrician, and give back. I love my major. I'm so glad I chose it. we had a great discussion today about poverty and things of that nature. I am definitely a democrat but that doesn't mean I'm some liberal. liberals get such a bad wrap--it's not true. you know what else gets a bad wrap? jester. jester really isn't that bad. to me, when people complain about jester, they just sound really really spoiled. I know that's judgmental but oh well. I love how it's really social. that's how I met one of my really good friends here. we were in our HORRIBLE community bath --no it's not really horrible-- and that's how we met. she is really cool, from out of state. time's almost up. adios amigo. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, here I am; doing a paper that was assigned weeks ago hours before it is due. I do not know what it is that causes me to procrastinate as much as I do. Lack of sleep, maybe. Laziness, probably. I consider myself a good student, but when it comes to doing papers or projects I always put it off until the last minute. I just got home tonight, its past midnight, and I am tired. I really want to go to sleep so I am not dead during classes tomorrow. I am worried about how things are going to work out grade-wise. This is my first experience with a grading system such as college, with so much emphasis placed on tests and very few other grades. Pretty much all my classes are going well, but I am not sure how I am going to study for exams. However, I think that if I keep up my study habits that got me here, I will do just fine. I am really hungry right now because lunch was my last meal and I do not want to eat now because apparently it is bad for you to eat before you sleep. My eating habits worry me too now. Three solid meals a day used to do it for me, but now breakfast is gone and one large meal a day is usually all I go for. My head itches a lot now that my hair has grown out. I really love music. No matter how my day is going, there is always a song out there that can raise my spirits. I enjoy all different kinds, and I have listen to a variety since I have started writing. It is quite weird now that I think about it, but music is one of the only things that can truly mellow me out. I have always been a calm, collected person but there is just something about it that I truly love. The whole college experience has been great so far. I love the campus, the professors, and the people. Most of my professors give great lectures, and class is actually enjoyable now. I almost look forward to each new school day now that I'm at the University. Being on my own and experiencing what life has out there is so awesome, but there are times that I wish I was still back home in high school, not worrying about anything. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am sitting at my small desk, looking at my computer I am not sure what I should be writing about, so I just type my shoulders hurt and I am ready to go to bed but I have so much more to do before I leave tomorrow to go home I am excited about seeing rich I wonder what we will do I know I have to work a lot and I w2ill probably be tired when I am done, but I will probably still want to go out because all I do here is work, study, work out, and try to keep my life in order cleaning my root day was a pain in the ass, finding places for everything sucked, and I still am not done. it will feel like a dark cloud over my head until everything is in place, which is likely to never occur. my roommate passed out tonight while studying. she works crazy hard and is so focused. right now she keeps mumbling in her sleep. it is pretty funny. I hope I don't disturb her. I don't know if she would want me to wake her up because she fell asleep in her clothes and stuff on her book. I'll probably just turn the lights off or something like that. I am craving some ice cream right now. I want vanilla frozen yogurt with granola. mmmmm. that will be my reward for getting this done early. I am glad that I finished my astronomy assignment tonight. it was just another thing that was hanging over my head. I have all this damn reading to do. and I can't seem to get past any of it because the second I finish one chapter, there is another chapter due in that book and in my other classes. Plus studying for that menu test. it should be fine though. I always get more stressed than I need to over everything. I like my laptop, but these keys piss me off. I don't understand why certain things happen. the cursor moves and it messes up what I am typing. grrrrr. I also want a diet coke. I am having trouble understanding why people gain 15 lbs when they go to school. I walk my ass off to and from classes. I am so afraid that I am going to gain weight. I didn't have time to make it to the swimming pace today. grrrrr. and I haven't done the firm today either. I really should. I need do. but I woke up too damn late to do it. I hope I get up at a good time tomorrow morning. I wonder when rich is going to call. I think when I finish this I am going to take a shower. that will feel good, and rich will probably call super late, whenever fox's closes. I miss him. I hope he is having fun,  I wish I was 21 already. it is such a pain in the ass. I feel so much older. this juv del class is totally opening up my eyes to understanding different cultures and ways of thinking. and it is making me seriously doubt the stigma of underage drinking. I know they have their reasons, young drinking affecting high school, and drinking and driving accidents and whatnot,  but still. How can I be treated as an adult in the court system, work place, and everything else, but still not be allowed to drink alcohol?  That doesn't make sense at all to me. how can my friends be allowed to fight in war yet not drink beer?  that is silly. and frustrating. and now that I know how the laws came to be how they are, I am even more stupefied by it. I love that class and teacher. he teaches basically directly out of the book, so I just have to skim read it, and that is pretty awesome. and his lecture is interesting, and he makes me laugh. that is so important. a sense of humor is everything. I like my nut teacher too, but learning that stuff makes me fee guilty for eating. if these damn pop-ups don't stop soon, I am going to have a serious problem. I am glad I am leaving again this weekend. even though everyone says leaving is bad, I still have a great time at home. and right now, I don't feel like I am missing out on anything here. I am going to try to balance it well, but I love spending time with rich. I love him, and I think he brings out the best in me. he has such a great sense of humor. and I laugh all the time when I am with him. I laughed so much at dinner tonight with them and bryttne. not at brytt so much, but em and I are so open "
Tell me about yourself.,"Ok well here I am sitting in my dorm room trying to finish this assignment. Earlier today I had called the student financial aid services because all of my financial aid hasn't come through yet. But now they said it should be getting here anytime soon. And one more thing I still need to do is go get a book for my government class because earlier in the week, they had said that it had been ordered although it wasn't there yet. So I'm probably going to have to go later on today. Then my roommate is going to the football game tomorrow morning. I still don't have a sports package and I didn't buy a ticket so this time I won't be seeing the game. I have a paper due for government on monday concerning my political views and where I come from and who or what has influenced me to think that way. I'm still unsure as to what exactly I will be saying. I just have a couple of ideas written down in a piece of paper. Oh man, yesterday some friends and I went to go work out and for some reason my legs are kind of sore right now. We're probably going again today, but who knows. I'm starting to get a little hungry now, I ate breakfast this morning but I'm getting hungry again. Oh I almost forgot, today is my friend's birthday, I need to call him after I finish this assignment. He is back at my hometown, El Paso, but I'm still calling him to wish him a happy birthday. For some strange reason our room always gets real cold. And then our neighbors have the little thing to control the air conditioner but supposedly they can't move it unless we fill in some sort of request. And then other people down the hall complain that it's too hot in their room. I don't know but whatever. My board here in the room looks kinda plain right now. I was initially going to put up some posters a while back, but I ended up doing other stuff and then I would get lazy, so till now the board still looks bare. All I have is one poster on one of the walls here to my right. And then the curtains we put up kept falling at the beginning but we finally got them to stay. All I need now is to actually get the other pictures I wanted to put up already. Oh and then there's my calendar on the wall too, but that's about it. I'm definitely going to finish that this weekend. Last night our neighbors were making a lot of noise and I just couldn't fall asleep. Soon enough I did though. And then I had to wake up early because I have an eight o' clock class, but I managed to do it. So now I'm just here waiting for my roommate to get back from work because we need to go to the store and I need to get a book. Then she said she wanted to buy some jersey for the game on saturday. While I'll be sleeping in, she will be at the game. she can later tell me how the game went, because last time it was raining, hopefully it won't rain again. Now I'm a bit thirsty, I think I'm going to go get myself something to drink from downstairs. Ok that was all for my 20 minutes. finished. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now, I am thinking about my chemistry homework and test. I am very nervous about it and I am worried that I may not succeed to my fullest potential. I am also very nervous and anxious about doing this writing assignment because I have never done this before. I'm also listening to music because it helps me to relax. I am cold and sometimes in makes it difficult to concentrate because my attention is focused on my coldness. I pretty much just look around the room every single day and it helps me to think things through. I also think about the things I have done wrong in my life and how it is that I can go back and correct them. There is this person I love so much with my entire heart, but I don't like him hanging around my best friend. Wait, its more like I don't like for her to hang around him. Yesterday, she just freaked me out because she just came up to us, my friends and I, and she just leaned on my boyfriend. What kind of a friend is she to do that? She knows that I hate for her to be around my boyfriend. And every time she is around him I end up getting mad at him, when, in reality, I should be getting mad at her. There are so many things I want to tell her, but I'm afraid I'll end up hurting her, but I feel she needs to know that it does hurt me a lot when I see her flirting with my boyfriend. She has always been boy crazy, its just that people don't know that. Every time she is around him I get this ugly feeling in my tummy like there is something very wrong. And then today just out of nowhere I told her that she needed to find herself a man, a companion that she could spend time with and stay away from me and my boyfriend. I know I shouldn't say that, but its true. I have always been very insecure about myself, but my boyfriend always tells me that I am beautiful and that he loves me very much. I truly believe him and in my heart that we love each other. Its just my best friend somehow interferes. I figure is she keeps on doing that I am going to let her know how I feel because I don't want to keep my feeling all bottled up inside of me. First of all, I have never been able to deal with my feelings so I pretty much just kept them bottled up inside. I don't know why I did that but I did, up until the time I started going out with my boyfriend. He changed me and the way I felt about myself and I cherish that because he has made a huge impact in my life. I love him so dearly. Anyways, enough about that. I talked to my dad about an hour ago. I call him every day, twice a day in fact. I am what you call Daddy's Little Girl!"" I am very proud to say that because I love my father very much. He has done so much for me and I wish there was a way that I could give something back. The thing is I used to be able to tell my dad everything, but then something changed. I stopped telling certain things. I guess he kind of saw me as something I wasn't and that made me very sad. In fact, I'm getting teary-eyed right now. It's like my father had this whole other image of the daughter he wanted. I tried to tell him that I was different, but he just wouldn't understand. And now that I am over here at college its like, I wish I could take back every bad thing I did to him. I want to tell him everything that has happened in my life, some good things and some bad. I want him to know all the obstacles and temptations that I have encountered throughout the past few years. I feel he needs to know what his daughter has gone through in her life. A few days ago when I talked to him, I felt homesick. When I hung up with him, I started crying. I poured my heart out right in front of my boyfriend. I told my boyfriend everything about how I wanted to have a better relationship with my father. I want to let him know that I love him so much and that I appreciate him for everything he has done for me. I also miss my mom because she has always done things for me and taught me different things. She is special to me because of who she is. I love her dearly. I miss my little brother and older brother too. I also miss my dog and my cat. They are like my children. They are growing up without their mommy and that makes me sad. I want to be there for them. I love my dad, mom, brothers and boyfriend. I hope they know that they mean a lot to me and that I am lucky to have them as a part of my life. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, first I'm thinking that I should've done this a few days ago instead of on the last day. There are still a few hours left, but it's never good to procrastinate. I guess it's ok because I've been very busy lately doing work for other classes. I'm usually in my dorm doing work instead of going to 6th street and getting drunk, which is what I thought I was supposed to be doing. Some of my friends call me a hermit"" now because I'm in my dorm doing work a lot of the times. I don't really care. I'd rather be responsible. I do go out though. Yesterday I went with some friends to go watch a volleyball game. Now I'm feeling full and satisfied because I just ate a pizza and I was extremely hungry. I haven't felt this satisfied in a while. I don't really like most of the food in the cafeteria, but the pizza is good. I miss the food at home. I miss home a lot. I miss my family even though I talk to them over the phone just about every day. It's just not the same when you are away. Life at home this summer was so simple. I was just in my house very comfortable and without worries. I would go out with my girlfriend every few days. I miss her desperately. I think I was supposed to also describe what I'm smelling. I don't really smell anything right now. I wish I could smell my girlfriend's perfume again. I think that's my favorite smell of all. It's weird because I sometimes ""remember"" what the scent was. I don't think that's supposed to happen. Now I'm thinking that I've been typing too damn much and my hands are getting tired. Oh well. It's in the name of science. Now I'm thinking that someone might probably be reading this. I feel sorry for whoever has that job. Sorry for writing this much. Sorry for not being very interesting. Now I'm remembering that I missed the rain again. I missed yesterday's rain because I was in my psychology class. When I got out, the ground was wet. It happened again today on the count of my pre cal class. Now I'm thinking that I probably should've done this thing on internet explorer instead of netscape because I think there should be a timer above this box thingy. Now I don't know when to stop. I'm probably going to stop too soon. I'll get an F in this assignment. I'll fail this class and be dropped. Then I won't be considered a full time student because I'm only taking 12 hours. I'll be forced to go home, and I will go home a failure. Hmm. that probably won't happen. After all, I've been having so much here, even though it is away from all that I hold dear. I think I have 10 more minutes to go. Now I'm feeling that I have to go take a leak. Dammit. It'll have to wait. I'm still not sure what this is for and what it studies. Maybe someone will read this and say that I'm crazy. That would be funny. All I need is confirmation. Now I'm thinking that my time would be better spent outside. Outside the air was cool and the sky was cloudy. A very pretty day. I hate being inside. I'd much rather be outside. I have a good view of the outside from my window. I'm on the seventh floor so it's pretty cool. I think I'm doing this wrong. I'm still not sure why. I think my time is coming running out. Yup, I'm done. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well I'm sitting here wondering why I have to do this assignment. Should I type     correctly, capitalizing words. I don't normally when I chat on I'M or email someone. I really wonder if I'm ever going to get that song I'm practicing on the guitar. It's so     hard to hear the parts because there are so many other instruments, namely the     piano which is really getting in the way. Maybe I should try something simpler. but I get so bored with the simple stuff. I wonder if I can eventually get a Jason     Mraz song or get to the point where I can just play something cool and everyone     recognizes it. Will I ever lead worship at a church? Who knows. I don't really think     that's my thing. there are so many cool people that do that already. In fact, I loved     Friday night worship at the Sanchez Building. I really want to go back. I don't know     if Hope in the City is the church that the Lord wants me at, but I really like it. I love     how everyone is so friendly and genuine -- the worship is passionate, and I love     that. I walk in and go, this is how Christians SHOULD be. "" not like the majority of     churches you walk into and see all the little cliques of friends, most of which are     too comfortable and exclusive to open up to a new type of person or just a person     in general. however, I know that there are some really cool places in Austin that I     want to try: The Austin Stone, Hyde Park Baptist. who knows. Oh, EV Free. Oh, I     saw court rode today. Man I love that girl. I hate that it's sometimes a struggle to     talk to her though. It's cool if we talk about the general stuff, but not normal enough     to just say whatever or something stupid because we haven't spent much time together. I mean, she is really cool, but she is a senior and has her own stuff, and I doubt that     she would ever just want to hang out with me. However, I should give myself some     credit -- I mean, she has called me and invited me to places (church, a cook-out. ),     so maybe she is interested in introducing me to some cool people. Cool people --     I'm finding some but still missing Steph and Allison back home. Man I love them,     too. They're great. I miss being so comfortable with someone that you can just do     or say whatever's on your mind. or if nothing, you don't have to say anything, and     it's totally fine. I wonder how they're doing. I wonder how Allison is doing in the     dorm, meeting new people, finding new good friends, like Amanda. I'm really     excited that Allison is branching out and exploring A&M, but I'm not ready for loss     of contact completely, and I don't think she is either. I think she wants to (as do I     and as does Stephanie) ""make new friends but keep the old; one is silver and the     other gold. "" I can deal with being silver, or bronze even, but I would like to keep a     place in her life. And man, I really want Stephanie and I to stay the good friends     that we've become this summer. after Leslie's death. I love how she always     understood and felt the same way I felt. We agreed that we never knew what Al     was thinking but that we wanted to. Leslie -- man I miss her so much. Silver Taps     at A&M is tonight, and I really want to drive back. I know I would miss Spanish in     the morning, but I just want to see my friends and talk about her and remember     her. I feel like things would be so different if she were still here: Stephanie and I     would never have become as good of friends as we have because they would still be     hanging out all the time. They would still support and love me completely, of     course, but I think I would be more like Allison -- really branching out and finding     new people. Plus, Stephanie would have someone to chill with in College Station. Sarah is cool and all, but she has her own issues, and I really would like someone     there to keep Stephanie accountable, to pay her the attention that she needs. because we all do! I would really like to find someone like me, but not too much,     and without a boyfriend (because the only cool girls I've found so far have boys. long-term boys, I think). I really want someone (a girl) that I can just play around     with -- be stupid and say stupid things, but also have fun and be silly. I want to be     able to plop down on her bed and either cry or laugh incredibly loud. Amazing, I     actually already have that. Do I need/want new friends other than camp friends     like Megan and Meredith. They love me so much and support me like crazy. They     like it when I'm around and like to spend time with me and hear about things with     me. especially Meredith. Megan has got lots of other stuff that's she is doing --     which is cool -- but she just doesn't really have all the time for me. which I guess     sounds kinda selfish now that I've typed it out. But Meredith -- truly loving and     sincere and like a big sister. Just seeing her around campus encourages me and     makes me feel at ease. Not that I'm so uncomfortable here. I am SO GLAD that I     left College Station and A&M to come to Austin and UT. What a blessing! this     place is amazing and fun and new and exciting but also is quickly becoming a     home. I find myself either almost getting lost or just finding new places or     directions or whatever to go around town, and I love it. I love being able to know     what street takes me somewhere else, or where my friends' houses are or where     to go shop or. whatever else. Friends' houses. the boys -- haven't talked to them,     want to see them. The girls -- looooved going over to their house the other night. I     got to chill with Meg and tell her about school and life and etc while she shared     the same. Liz and I also got to talk about Spirits and applications and all that jazz. Oh and I made it to the second round of the Texas Spirits app! Exciting. I can't     decide what I think about it though. I know who I am, and I just want to be myself,     but from what I hear and have seen, it might be like a sorority. Blah. I just don't     want to conform -- I want to be a part of something cool and unique but without     being stereotyped as something. I don't know. cookie-cutter, I guess. I hate that. I     want people to like me for who I am. stupid and crazy and silly and fun and smart     and perfectionist that likes crazy things and crazy music. crazy music -- ACL! And     Russ is coming into town, and I just don't know what I think about that. Do I like     him? Does he like me? I have no idea. I don't think I'd ever date him. he is     younger and in Colle Sta and whatnot. But he is pretty great. I just have no idea. Ok well honestly I can't stop looking at the timer and how I have thirty seconds left. So I hope that I wasn't graded on capitalization or anything because I'm sure that I     messed up all over, but hey it's all good -- all we had to do was write this thing. I'm     confident. I'm happy. Class is cool. Don't want to take the tests "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am downloading stuff on kazaa. I've saved so much money this way. I need to make sure my grammar, punctuation, and spelling are correct. I have a basketball (plush) on my table, although I never play with it. Yeah, my web cam sucks. It's old. But free. My roommate is cool. He is sitting there doing the survey. I had a good day today. I want to go to the church next to Dobie. Probably this sunday. Yeah. Sunday sounds good. 1608 is my room number. I have a song stuck in my head right now. I can't remember the name of it. actually, I didn't know the name to begin with. Its a rap song. I need to charge my Palm m505. And take a shower. That would feel good. My mouth is dry. I need something to drink. Now I need to piss. It's really dark in here. This apple juice is not good for my teeth. I think there's sugar in it. Not good. Wow, it's only been 5 minutes and 20 seconds. That sucks. I'm getting bored. I want to play some computer games. Too bad I'm stuck with this assignment. Oh, now I have a different rap song stuck in my head. I think I'm obsessed with them. I remember listening to this song a few hours ago before dinner. I was at my friends house if I can remember correctly. Humans are funny. I need to spend my taco bell coupon. Coupon or Coupon? I've heard it pronounced both ways. I wonder when my parents are going to call? Probably soon after 9? Or maybe 9:30? Haha, I just remembered something from dinner. My friend was taking pictures of girls with his phone camera. The asterisk looks like a snowflake. I noticed that I like to stand my chair up on it's front two legs. Well, that is if it had legs. It's more like a bar on both sides and connected in the middle. At least its comfortable, unlike the ones in San Jacinto. Yeah. San Jacinto. I went on a field trip there. No, wait. It was Washington on the Brazos. Maybe that is close. I don't know. I like the way you do it right thar. A line from the song I have stuck in my head. Geez, its been 9:50 only. Like I said earlier, this sucks. Damn, I'm typing too fast and my grammar is messing up. My speaker system and subwoofer rock. My hands hurt from typing so much. I should study more. I haven't even opened any of my books yet. Oh well, the weekend is coming up. I can do most of my stuff then. I hope I'm not going to be like this later on in the year. It's a bad sign. I hope I don't get lost in my homework assignments. I can't seem to find the Philosophy 301 website. Not good. Yeah. I got a nice view from here. I need to email my parents and send them more pictures. Awww, how sweet of me. I never realized how long 13 minutes can be. Wow. It's like. long. Yeah, anyways, I feel kind of weird talking to myself. Weird? Or is it spelled wIErd? I will have to look that up later. I'm sore from sitting like this. Well, I only have 3 more items on my download list in Kazaa Lite K++. If you read this, get the K++ edition, not Kazaa, not Diet Kazaa, and not Kazaa Lite. K++ &gt; *. Yuuuhhhhhhhhh. I'm bored. I need to shower. I already mentioned that didn't I? Awesome, only 4 1/2 minutes to go. This sucks. It's boring. I'm not thinking of anything. My neck hurts. I don't smell anything out of the ordinary. I guess I got used to the smell of my room. 3 more minutes! I don't think I can last that long. I don't want to go to prison. Heh, it's not a confession or hinting at anything I've ever done. I'm a good guy. Yeah. Good. Maybe too good. Nah. 1 1/2 minutes to go. Wow, I'm really slowing down. This would probably take up 1 to 2 pages in Microsoft Word, 12 point font, Times New Roman. It's kind of sad how I can know this. I will test it out whenever I finish the 20 minutes. I also need to test out w(ei/ie)rd. SAT format baby. Yeahhhhh! 15 seconds! I think I will just wait it out. I'm so happy now. YAY! "
Tell me about yourself.,"I don't understand how it is I'm supposed to write this thing when I can't even type as fast as I can think. it's crazy because right now at this moment I am under pressure to think. at the same time I am trying to spell every thing correctly because I am a horrible speller. I have trouble with double letters in words. for instance tomorrow. is that right?  it's funny that someone who is supposed to be smart. I hate when people call me smart because I don't feel it. it's even wrong to say that I just work hard because I really don't. I was one of those loser high school kids that never studied and was only interested in class if there was some hard core discussion happening. my teachers never knew and neither did my parents because they always assumed I was studying hard. well they piss me off because they or rather my dad kicked me out because of stupid crap. I think it was because I never talked to them I hated talking to them. they were so bluh. I mean I talked about sports and politics and crap with my dad. but never anything serious that involved me. and my step mom lied to me about most of her life. telling me that she was so sweet and innocent as a young person but she actually had like 3 abortions and now she can't have kids. then when I got kicked out she tried to be all nice and stuff to me. people never I'M me and now that I am trying to write this thing everyone wants to talk to me. that's like when you are on the phone talking to someone you haven't talked to in a while all your friends start to call you or when you run out of minutes. I think it's a rip off to society how these stupid phone companies and internet providers make us pay. last month I had to pay $117 on that stupid cell phone. I didn't even realize I had talked that much on the thing. now I have lost my train of thought and have no idea what to write. can I cuss on this thing. I don't want to sound dumb or uneducated (which actually to some degree I'm not and early I did say I wasn't smart) does that make me crazy. I wonder if I can type stuff in another language. say for instance people who's first language isn't english like my boyfriend. I think he thinks in portuguese and then translates everything to english or maybe not I do that for spanish when I am trying to understand people but I can't speak it for the life of me but I can somewhat write it. and I normally understand it too. but I really want to learn it big time for when I become a doctor. I want to be a teacher too but I'm afraid because I'm like super mean and right now my hands are tired from writing and I really hate the fact that I keep up with my chemistry and this homework, but my pre-cal I dread. maybe because that loser assigned 80 discouraging problems. they are supposed to be really easy but the way he teaches confuses me and it really ticks me off. I think I'm just not going to go to class and just do the work on my own and ask my really smart friends who are in calculus right now if I run into a problem. but how hard can it be I took that crap in high school but I forgot it all because I never went for understanding just for the right answer. I am developing absolutely horrid study, sleeping, and everything else habits here. I don't even clean as often as I used to. I just want to be lazy and go out. I mean I never got to do that stuff when I was home because I dad was super strict. I never even got in trouble at school. not that that is to be rewarded because you're supposed to behave in school and make good grades. which I did. but I had a job and participated in sports and did well in them too. but my dad wanted too much he wanted me to be perfect and to not make mistakes. I'm not just exaggerating either. my grandparents not even his own mother understand why he did what he did. and he has explained why he kicked me out. it sucks because I have to pay for everything when I thought I had everything. sometimes life sucks big time but I'm not about to complain anymore because I'm still here and my grandparents are helping me and I am trying to help myself but I just get so tired sometimes. I want to keep writing but I'm supposed to do my pre-cal so I can go to target with heather at like five to spend money I don't have. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am beginning to write this assignment and I'm thinking that is a pretty big waste of time. I'm already bored and I don't like it. I can smell the bread I got at la madelines and it smells pretty good. I don't normally eat there so it was a treat and I was there with a good friend so it was pretty fun. my friend/roommate just flushed the toilet and I think it sucks down pretty hard. alright only eighteen minutes to go. the more I smell the bread the more I want to eat it. it smells really good. the tv is on right now and it is on mtv, the voice of our generation. I was watching a show on christina aguilara and realized how gorgeous she really was when she dresses normally. man I'm hungry!  I got to say I want to pierce my lip. the more I think about it the more I want to do it. I think it would so cool. and I want a tattoo. too bad my dad is anal about stuff like that. oh well, one of these days. we better beat the hell out of arkansas next saturday or I'll be pissed. my friend made me laugh because he heard this commercial for the dumbest movie ever, malibu's most wanted. I could go for some cereal. my mom's in europe on a cruise right now. queer eye for the straight guy is the dumbest excuse for television ever. what a waste of time that was. they don't even dress like straight guys. they are really gay and there style sucks. jimmy fallon is a funny guy I met him in new york. it is weird how peoples minds drift. I wish I could be a professional assassin. not even a ninja assassin, just one with a cool silenced gun. I don't know why. it just seems cool. to take care"" of evil men. like in the boondock saints, the greatest movie ever. I hope I get to run track in the spring and I make the team. that would be like a dream come true. I would be a college athlete. that would be neat. and all the ladies love that. I think music is a great thing. I hope I find a bassist for my man while I'm here and we can play a show here at emo's. this is taking a lot longer than I thought it would. beyonce knowles is a good looking' woman. I don't know why she likes jay-z. to be famous would be nice, but to be a doctor would be nicer because I earned that. good charlotte sucks. they are terrible live and I don't get why people like them. the guitarist isn't even good. I'm half way done. that is nice to know. my mind is being strained. the texans one today and they beat the dolphins. that is awesome because some thought the dolphins would win the super bowl. we'll see about that. texas football rules. my old high school one its first game of the season yesterday and they did well. my little brother one his first high school of his career and he was pretty proud. He is on the a team and that is a big deal. blah blah, that is what my mind thinks. its neat to see what people can think of. I need to buy some milk for my room. I could go fro some cocoa-cocoa dyno bytes. they are so good, and chocolaty. mmmmmm. delicious. instant messaging is an interesting concept in these connected times of ours. that would suck to be a worm. have no legs and what not, I need to get xp for my computer so I have word, excell and power point. that would be nice. only six minutes to go. I don't know why people love asses so much. its kinda gross when people think about what they really are. chris rock is pretty find. he just has a really big mouth and I'm surprised he hasn't gotten beaten up. it was jack black's birthday not too long ago and he is really funny. I just started showing my friend how to play the guitar and she is doing pretty well. probably because she knows how to play the violin. david blaine is the most amazing street magician ever. the olsen twins are worth over a billion dollars. rock music is the best sort of music because I can get into it more I think. rap isn't real music. just like good charlotte. I like evanescence because that girl is hot and linkin park is good because they are different. the white stripes suck however because that girl can't drum to save her life. it is interesting to see how people interact. I don't know why. maybe that is why I want to be a psychiatrist. I'm trying to spell correctly on this and I don't know why. maybe so you can understand what is being typed on this crazy assignment. linkin park won the best rock video award. it was interesting. I don't know why. that band has a lot of asians in it. metallica is a well received band because they are good. I could never be a typical rock star because I can't think I could be that mean to people. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I just got out of psychology class like an hour ago so I thought I would do this paper while I am still in the thinking mode. I thought what pennebaker said about how students new to the college experience, like myself are under lots of stress. that is true. and how they are more prone to get sick when they go home because their stress is relieved. but I think I am sick right now because I've been coughing a lot and my nose is all clogged up. I think it's from the air conditioning in my dorm. but I'm not supposed to be sick now, right? anyways I've been here in austin for almost three weeks now and I have had lots of new experiences but I am beginning to get homesick. I miss my mom, dad, and sisters, and the city of houston. I am glad that I have friends from high school here that I can lean on. just ate dinner. it was really good and now I'm really full. my dance class starts tomorrow, can't wait for that. I don't like sleeping on the top bunk, don't sleep very well, been taking lots of naps. probably cause I stay up too late and have to get up early. lots of traffic noises outside. can hear buses. reminds me of when I got on the completely wrong bus the first week of school. I met a guy and have been hanging out with him. he seems really cool. I want to us to be friends but scared he might want to be more than friends. just adds to all the stress. I really need to be at the library studying right now. I think I will go when I finish this. just learned how to play racquet ball the other day. it's really fun, but very exhausting. I am so sore. also my legs hurt from walking around campus so much. I am really out of shape. everybody is concerned about the freshman fifteen but I really don't care if I gain fifteen pounds. it is highly unlikely since I eat like a bird, but I would be okay with the extra weight. I'm not going home until the end of september which means I will be going five weeks without seeing my family. I've never gone for more than a week without seeing them. can't wait to go home and see them and go to a pat green concert in houston. seems like not many people here listen to country music which is mostly what I listen to, although I do like other kinds of music. my twenty minutes is up. got to go! "
Tell me about yourself.,"wow I didn't know it was going to time it for me that is awesome. I'm just kind of tapping they keys waiting for something to enter my head for me to write down. I'm really getting tired of hitting the backspace key because I keep typing the wrong letters. I wonder if I will get anymore mail, hopefully. Its  kind of fun opening the mail box and actually having stuff in it. I didn't know where the laundry was until last night. It sucks there is nothing cool in the north tower everything is in the south tower and that is too far for me to want to walk. The light in my room is really big and the papers on my bulletin board are waving around from my air-conditioning. Its hella hot outside, I can't wait till october or november when it will cool down. The animation on my beer poster sure is shitty, I definitely got to cover it up with other pictures, I suck at spelling, its only been 6 minutes this really does feel like forever, I really just don't have a lot to say. HA the radio just said hello to me its so polite, I'm trying to decide whether or not to turn it on. For some weird reason my roommate but an empty water bottle inside a drink cup, it kind of reminds me of abstract art, like when homer tried to build a barbeque and ended up with a big pile of bricks with an umbrella sticking out. I wonder if the McLaren really is the fastest road car in the world. I'm pretty fast I think I could beat it. Al pacino looks a little up set its ok though he is about to snort a whole big pile of cocaine, what a crazy guy, all this typing is making me thirsty again. Bottled water is so stupid. Why would u pay for water that somebody else just filled up out of a tap in the backroom when u can get a cup for free. some people are just idiots. People really do look funny when they cross the finish line in races. It really is a lot harder then it seems to put the top on a bottle. I wonder if I will ever use this stapler that I brought. It does make my desk look very professional though. I ate way too much pizza, rolls, fettuccine alfredo and chicken, they all really don't mix. A blue viper is cool. My hair is getting long again if my dad sees me he will be like so son when do u want me to set up an appointment for you to get your hair cut. just because his dad was a barber doesn't mean that he knows when other people need hair cuts. But my grandad did have one of those cool barber poles and my grandma always tells me what each color stands for and says one day when I'm on a tv game show they will ask me that question and I will win lots of money I think the white is for the skin, red for the blood and blue for the veins. I think. I just spilled water all over my shirt I need to work on my mouth hand coordination. but I suppose water is better then throw up. Stupid reed throwing up on my only UT shirt down in cancun. my roommate sure has some girly colored push pins    they are all pastel colors. the freeway is pretty busy right now, I wonder where everyone is going. I really did eat to much, just sitting here typing is making my stomach hurt. I need some tums. They taste like chalk though, yuck even though I have never eaten chalk before I still know what I would taste like, All dry and chalky. it really would be funny if david still went by texas time instead of Maryland time. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I didn't know there was a timer on  this thing. This is kinda weird typing all my thoughts. My ring is broken. My ice cream is really good. That place down stairs has good ice cream. I'm tired. I need to go look for a new job today. I am going to 3 different Chili's to apply. I like my mousepad. My roommate just came in and it scared me. She just turned on the water. I'm thirsty. This ice cream is making me thirsty. I want to go home today. I miss my friends and family. But I'm not going to go home today. I am going to stay here. 20 minutes of writing your thoughts is a lot of time. which means a lot of thoughts. I have to read like 3 chapters for oceanography because I keep forgetting to read. So now I'm really really behind. I need to catch up so I don't fail. I need to go to the grocery and get some more food and drinks for in here. I'm almost out of Cokes because I go through them so fast. My roommate is talking to me about laundry. I haven't done laundry here yet. I went home last time to do it (to Round Rock). She said the washing machines are really small and the dryers are really big. We just swept in here. It gets dirty pretty fast. And you don't even notice. I want a College of Education t-shirt. I saw one today but it was for the education council. and I don't think I want to join that. I don't like ""counseling"" haha. But really I don't like speaking in front of people or anything. So I'm sure that would not be fun for me. But-I don't know what I am talking about right now. Klint just came online. Yay. He must have just woken up. It's kinda late. But he wakes up late. That's ok though. I wish I could sleep late. I have classes too early to sleep late. It's kinda weird because I don't like to go to bed early. So it would be really good if I had late classes. Education Council sounds like you just bond with the teachers and stuff. Like student council. So yeah-not for me. I like Klint. I have not seen him in a while. I also have not seen Chris Russell in a while. My phone is ringing. Stop ringing. It's Carl. I have not talked to him in forever. Sara likes her pants. I have some like those. I got them from Target. I want to go shopping. I don't have any money though. I saw Tiffany's sister in class the other day and I didn't know if it was her. So I didn't know whether or not I should say hi. But she had her eyebrow pierced so I didn't say hi. And I told Tiffany that and she said I was lucky that I didn't say hi to her because she would have been really mean to me. That sucks. I don't like mean people. I hate making friends. It's so hard to be able to tell who your real friends are or not. I don't really have any friends here yet. I met one guy. And I have a few other friends who I see off and on. But still. All my friends left. Which is not very cool. I want to burn a CD. I have a whole bunch left. I need to renew my internet service. It doesn't expire til Sept. 23rd though. I need to look for those blue books. My spanish teacher said we need some for monday. And I have some because Jenny gave them to me. The lawns outside must be getting mowed. I hear a lawn mower. Anywho Desiree needs a blue book so I need to find them so I can give her one. So yeah. I like the pictures in my room. They remind me of my friends. I miss them. Jenny is having a lot of fun I think. She has 5 roommates but they all share an entire floor. And there are 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms and a living room and everything. That would be cool. I wish I had money to buy that here. But next year I am getting an apartment with Katie I think. She wants to get fish but I don't like fish. They die too easily. Katie gave me a big Texas poster. She knows that I hate museums and stuff like that and she went to the Bob Bullock museum with her family and got me that poster. To be funny. So now I'm going to put pictures of my friends like riding the horses and stuff. I just realized that my psych class is not 2 hours long. It's only 1 and a half hours. I just thought we got let out early all the time. 20 minutes is a long time. Although it seems a lot shorter when you type everything you're thinking. But that's still a lot of thoughts. I would hate to grade these things. Almost over. Only 20 seconds left. I want more ice cream so hurry up and finish. I need to get a new pencil sharpener. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Wow, I really don't feel like typing for 20 minutes, especially because I can't type all that well. My foot really itches. It is so hot in here, my roommates keep the air up way to high. My hands are sweating, and it takes a lot fir me to sweat. I feel terrible. I really hope that I'm not getting sick. MY nose really itches. BAD! sniffle. I really miss Thomas. I wish he were here right now. Now my elbow itches. And my nose again. This commercial is so gross. I would run the other direction too. my legs are sweaty too. I wonder if the sweat will mess up my keyboard. I wonder where Ky is. gahh I really hope he doesn't like me. He is cool but I just don't want to go past friendship. My eyebrow itches too. man, stuff really itches when you are paying attention to yourself. My shoulder and nose both do. I have a lot of knots in my shoulders too. Maybe Thomas will I have me a massage when I go home this weekend. That hair is on my nerves. I have so much reading to do, I don't think I will ever get caught up. I am really worried about Kim. I hope she can get everything figured out money wise and also with her math. I don't know what I would do if she weren't here. Man my hands are sweaty, it is so hot in here. I wonder what Thomas is doing. He is having that dumb study group at his house tonight so I probably won't be able to talk to him that much. I love him. I wish he would be able to come here and visit. His parents would never let that happen. He is coming to the Nebraska game so maybe him and his dad can come see my place. My arm itches. Now the other one does, and my shoulder. I have a lot of knots. It felt great for them to be rubbed. My nose itches. I am so stopped up. There comes the air, maybe it will cool off. Kari must keep her air on like 80. I cannot type at all! my legs are stuck to this leather couch. I really need to go to Kim's to use her nair. My foot itches. I really need to go work out. I cannot gain weight this year. I need to shave too. I have so much that I need to do, but there's no way I can do it all. My hands are still sweating, but it feels better now that the air came on. Only 3 more minutes. This sweat better not mess up my computer. There goes Jayme's alarm. My eye itches but I can't scratch it because of my make-up. I have to change the TV. felicity just gets on my nerves. My ear itches. and my thigh. and my other ear. and my eye. wow! oooh Friends is on. but so is Trading Spaces. I love that show. Genevieve really gets on my nerves. Oh this is the kids version ugh I sneezed. I guess I will watch Friends now. Oh my 20 minutes is up! yay I can stop     "
Tell me about yourself.,"my room mate is listening to wierd music again. I have never heard of all these canadian bands. I really want to go to sleep. That would be so great right now. I can't wait to go home soon for the weekend. I would love to see my family soon since they are so fun. I really need a hair cut. I have split ends. There is a girl in our hall learning to play some sort of trumpet. She really sucks and I just wish she would give it up or practice somewhere else. I can't believe I have only been typing for 3 minute!  I really want to paint my dorm room. White is such a boring color. My suite mates got a beta fish this weekend. its a really pretty color. Better that the white of our room. I really want to sleep. looking at my bed makes me want to sleep. I can't even keep my eyes open any long. I have the longest, skinniest fingers in the world. I am also really not liking the fact that I have to read some much more in all my classes. I have 2 really cute cats at home. They are so fun to play with and cuddle. I really wish pets were allowed in dorms. I would so bring them up and then everyone in the hall would get to see them. I ran over my phone minutes again this month. I seem to talk on it a lot more that I realize. I am going to get a brain tumor by the age of 30. I really like the fact that I have gotten lots of mail since being here. All my friends have sent me mail. I got some today! Mail is fun. I feel bad though cause all my room mate gets is bank statements. sucks for her. Lots of people I know are in Psychology. They are all going to do this assignment too. I really can't spell well. Sorry if you are reading this. Well I think nothing really sticks to the walls in this dorm. I tried to hang curtains last weekend with this hook that was supposed to stick to anything and hold 20 lbs. But all it did was all and pull off a huge chunk of the wall paint. I can't get my pinata to hang from the ceiling either. I wander if anyone has been able to get stuff to stick?  I will have to ask around. I am the world smallest stapler on my desk. It was part of a dorm set I got for graduation. My friend who goes to A&M gave it to me. I wonder what she is doing. I am going to call her when I am done with this. But I am over my minute, that is ok. I think my suite mate is doing the pretesting experiment. She is enjoying it too. I asked. I am going to learn to play tennis. My room mate is done playing her canadian music, but is not from Canada. She is from plano os that is kinda odd. How did she ever hear about this music. I think I will get a beta fish too. They look fun and it would be something different to add to my room. But then I don't really like cleaning stuff so maybe not. I am so tired and my head really hurts. I need so aspirin. I need to exercise too. I ate too much for dinner. I like what I ate though. I got a catered dinner for free. What could be better- a nap. I wonder what my friends are doing. I got really good tickets to the football game- need to thank Steven. Its dark out. That is a huge tree "
Tell me about yourself.,"words are pouring out like endless rain into a paper cup they (?). but I like to use     periods. before, I was tempted to say, last night my ears met their lover. too bad they     didn't. haven't?  I just wanted to use that nice quote I stole from an editor of epitonic. I     have an hour till I have to go to LINK but I really don't know about this whole Christian     organization on campus thing I need to find one that fits me!  oh thoughts and feelings     sometimes I stare out at nothing in particular and it's in those times that I am thinking     about absolutely nothing oh I just got a call. but I'm still typing!  darn you booksellers call     back after nine thirty. I wonder if typos make a difference because I don't like leaving     them behind like that, so careless. So, I need to get a haircut. But how do I know which     kind?  You know, some people just look good no matter what. I think it's a level of     achievement that I will never reach. Oh well. What if people were the same inside and     outside?  Like, for example, if all the pretty people were extremely good souls. Now that'd     make things different. I can't really imagine what it'd be like, because I'm so busy thinking     about what I should write next. Man, what should I pursue?  My stomach is really full. I     used to think that if I ever smoked, I could quit anytime, just because it seems so gross. Well I can't even moderate my eating habits. And I bash myself about it, but when hunger     calls, I respond. In full!  So yeah. Sometimes I fear for my safety when I'm walking around     at night. Nothing ever bad has ever happened but I think I should still be careful. But I     don't think so enough since I'm going to do it tonight anyway. I'm going to watch the     Goonies at the Texas Union Theater. Theatre. Yeah. Hey. I wonder if I'm going to make     any good friends here at college. It's bad hanging out with old ones all the time, and     believe me, sometimes I just don't want to. Excuse me. I just sneezed. What if I do really     think in sentences?  I think I have a cold. My nose is rubbed pretty raw (well, not really)     from all the tissues. I'm not thinking about anything. Actually, what I would like is to     complete everything I need to get done soon. I don't know how possible that might be but     then that would leave me time to do leisurely activities, like reading and responding to     other people's e-mails. I'm so bad at that. And so I could have time to read the Bible and     pray. Ah, I cannot control what I do, or at least I'm not trying hard enough. It seems so     easy to be a good Christian when the pastor is talking about it but then laziness gets the     best of me. Oh I can wait. You know, I don't want to think I'm invincible. I want to make a     difference and experience life fully. The things I am most scared about now: public     speaking. I just want to die when all eyes are on me- the bigger the audience, the more     humiliating. You know, it's not like I can control how I feel, to an extent at least. I am also     afraid of getting into a car accident because my close friends just did and it seems     unbearable, the time in the hospital spent recovering. So many tubes. I'd cry out. And I'm     afraid of falling off my bike or getting into some other bike related accident. It's not so     much the pain that bothers me, but the public scene it would cause. How embarrassing. Oh well. Sometimes I don't care what other people think. Sometimes I wonder what they     think of me. When I'm shy, I tend to come across as being mean. I haven't really opened     up to anyone before. Why should I if I don't trust them or if I'm not sure that they care     about what I feel or think. I think I'm good at observing people in their behaviors. When     I'm talking to someone, I can tell if they lose interest in what I'm saying. At that very     moment when they look away for a second. I don't feel bad when that happens but it just     makes me lower the probability of me finding someone or some people who can connect     with me. I know. People need people. And I need a tissue right now. Is this going to be     read?  If it is, it's okay. I don't know if my thoughts are interesting, but it would be a fun     thing to grade. I feel like I'm spending less quality time when I'm reading out of my     textbooks. I want to go back, but then I just get this feeling of urgency. Even when I'm     surfing the net. Imagine that. What do I have to do anyway?  What's the difference     between an erection and an ejaculation?  I think I might know, but it doesn't matter so     much to me. I don't like it how professors can say whatever they want to say, like curse     words and sex related and other inappropriate topics. Just because they can talk about it     doesn't mean they should. Sheesh. I also don't like how repeated exposure to talk I don't     agree with and cuss words will desensitize me to it completely, probably by the end of the     semester. Here I am in college and I don't know everyone but a lot of them are making me     less pure. I don't think they realize what they're doing to the rest of us. What rest of us,     you ask?  I guess we are a minority then. I wonder what I'm going to do for the final     project in my freshman seminar. Either fencing, a Christian organization on campus, if I     ever find a good one!  or a concert. Although a concert might be kinda difficult since I'm     not going to one until October 7th. Yay for Beulah!  I'm so excited. When I go to shows, I     feel like I belong. I don't know anyone there, but I like to observe them. Most of them     have styles. I wish I had a style. I want to be like them. Or do I?  I want to be like me!  But,     I need to be more like me then. Maybe if I had a lot more money. I do have a lot of     money. What does being fashionable feel like?   Not as great as I think, of course. It just     hurts to see people wearing things out of fashion when they think they are in fashion. We     are the elite. At least my mind can distinguish between the two. But only street. What do     I make of myself then?  It's easy not to care, but it's not so easy to do that completely. Will     that make people like me more?  Is it easy to avoid everyone and keep to myself?  Is that     what we were meant to do?  The answer is no. What if it's different for me?  Everyone dies     alone, right Donnie?  I think I need clothes to reach the next level. Of making me satisfied. Oh, if I had a different body. No, no. That's alright then. People who know you don't care. It's the people you are trying to impress who care!  Hah. I wonder if I ever hurt anyone's     eyes. It pains me to think so. Before I left for college, at the goodbye dinner thrown for     me by my uncle, the message in my fortune cookie (or rather, one of them) was be     yourself and you will always be in fashion. ""  I suppose that's valid. Ooh I can continue     writing. Maybe for a bit longer. I wonder what it would be like to be very fashionable. I     mean, come on, I already struggle against feelings of superiority when it comes to music. What good does it do?  There are always better, there are always worse. But I won't say any     more about that. You know, I can't give all of myself away    and to a stranger!         (ok, I finished editing my paper)_ do you think that this (spilling out thoughts on paper) is     healthy for all of us?  not that it's not, but compared to making no difference    I think so. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm hungry, but I don't have any of the food I normally eat. If I had a car, I'd go to the grocery store and buy myself some more Myoplex (protein shakes) and some cereal and some milk, but my parents heard too many horror stories about first year college students flunking out of school because they drove their roommate to wrestling matches and out-of-town football games and such, so they wouldn't let me bring my car this semester. If I had gone to school out of state, like both my brother and sister did before me, I wouldn't be getting a car for the entire first year, but since my school tuition is roughly one third of what theirs was, and I have some scholarships on top of that, my parents are considering letting me bring my car to Austin at semester. I really don't know where there's room to park a Ford Expedition in this town, but I'll find some place. My car would have been nice to have last last Sunday morning, because there was a rowing team meeting at the boathouse, which is too far to walk to, and I ended up not being able to go because I couldn't find a ride. I was pretty upset, but My R. A. Danny, the one who talked me into trying out for the rowing team, told me to go to practice this morning anyway, and the coaches wouldn't mind. He was right. I just added my name to their list of names that they got at different meetings that I wasn't able to attend, went through the workout, and they told me to come back on Wednesday. It was a lot tougher than I would have thought, in some respects, but a lot less strenuous in others, when I look back at it. The one mile jog wasn't hard at all, and neither were the pull-ups, but eventually the sit-ups wore me out, and the jump-squats actually made me nauseous after a few sets. I think that's mainly because my legs were really sore from the gym the day before, which was a bad move on my part, but it's hard to say. I've never done jump-squats before, so I might have felt sick afterwards without being sore. We didn't get to go out on the water, which was somewhat disappointing, but the group of guys I was with are supposed to take a boat out on wednesday, while the other groups run body circuits, since that's all our group was able to do. We did actually take a boat down to the dock, and set it in the water, but I wasn't able to get in, and the boat never left the dock, so it wasn't as much fun as it could have been. I'm somewhat nervous about the next practice session. We get to use the rowing machines for the first time, and I've never used one before. I'm not sure if three sets of ten minutes is going to be a breeze, or if I'm really going to throw up this time. I work out 6 days a week, and I run, and most of my workouts are repetition, not heavy lifting, so I could definitely be in worse shape for rowing, but I'm still not sure how far away I am from the kind of endurance I need for the urgs"" (rowing machines. )  I would actually be stronger, but have less endurance if my shoulder hadn't been giving me problems all through high school. I pulled it while unloading some suitcases for some elderly friends at the New York airport after a two week cruise through Southern Europe. We went to the doctor, they told me to lay off it, and I did, but apparently it wasn't long enough. I was too anxious to get back in the gym, and I never let it heal completely, so about six months later I hurt it again. Six months after that, when it happened the third time, my parents took me to a doctor, and eventually to physical therapy. The therapist told me that my scapular region was too weak in comparison with my pectorals, triceps, biceps, and deltoids. Apparently I hadn't trained my back well enough to keep up with the rest of my upper body, which was causing my shoulders to carry all the strain of my movements, where the muscles in my back were supposed to be assisting the shoulder. The doctor was amazed that both shoulders hadn't been more severely damaged, but I was told that I wasn't beyond repair. A full month of therapy, very specific exercises, cross-friction massages, and ice massages helped a lot, but my shoulder is still pretty fragile. If I push myself too hard on the bench press, or if I don't put ice on my shoulder while stretching it for about ten minutes after every workout, it's sore for the next few days. I'm hoping that rowing will help develop the muscles in my back, especially the scapular region, so I can push myself harder at the gym when I'm training the rest of my upper body. The pull-ups we did the first day of training worked parts of my back that I can feel had been neglected, because the muscles were all tight and sore after only two sets of the pull-ups. Apparently some muscle somewhere in my back is getting some work, so I'm happy with the training so far. I was actually worried for a while that I wouldn't be able to train the rest of my body if I got serious rowing, but the coaches talked to us about how rowing really only works out your back and your biceps, so the rest of your body will need developing too, like your chest and triceps. This means I can still go to the gym, and I actually have more reason now than ever, because I have to keep my chest strong enough to balance with the back muscles that I will undoubtedly be developing. Running and jump-squats in training won't come anywhere close to giving me the leg workout I want, but I'm not sure when I'll be able to work legs without being sore at training the following day. I suppose that after a few weeks of real practice, assuming I make the team, I'll be able to decide when to work my legs, and how hard. Some of the guys there seemed to have been working out, or playing football in high school, because they were pretty used to running body-circuits, and jogging, and weren't too beat at the end of the day. Some of the other guys were obviously novices in the world of fitness. A few people vomited, one guy passed out, and I heard talk about a guy who was trying the rowing workout a few days ago who fell flat on his face and started convulsing. I'm not sure exactly what was going on there, but I'm glad nothing like that has happened to me yet. I can't wait for it to get cold outside, so I can actually stand in that boathouse without wanting to collapse. It was so hot and stuffy in there today that going outside in the 80 degree weather felt like walking into a refrigerator. Once it gets colder, I'm sure I'll have to buy a sweatshirt, and some warmer gym shorts, but the cold will be much more welcome than the hot sticky boathouse. It'll be a lot colder if I fall in the water too, but I'm hoping that won't happen too often. "
Tell me about yourself.,"My name is Ashley Mitchell and I am getting ready to write everything that crosses my mind within the next 20 minutes. Right now I'm thing about all the reading I have to do for my classes and what am I supposed to do with myself since I don't have a Psychology book. The book won't be coming in until Monday. I believe in God so I now that he will make a way for me to get my hands on a Psychology Book. What tv show comes on tonight and how long is this scholarship dinner going to be. Why does the Rugrats tv show come on in the middle of the day. What is my sister up to today? When is their next Battle of The Bands? My back hurts from typing so awkwardly. It's only been 4 minutes. It seems like I've typed everything I can think about. The lunch was pretty good I had I just wonder was it too fattening. I need to call the football trainer and see if I can get in touch with him. I need to start making connections now as a freshman if I want to accomplish my goals. HHMMMMmMMMm. I don't think the new Romeo show will be any good. I need to go and practice the piano since I haven't practiced since I left home. I need to find an organization that's perfect for me and I think the Texas Gospel is perfect. HMMMMMMM. I've never met the professor yet and I really have no idea what this class is going to be about. It seems like it could be interesting though. I'm glad I made the decision to come to UT. I feel like I've made a major change with myself. Spiritually, socially, and physically. I've grown up with black people my entire life. At first I thought that it was going to be a total culture shock, but I shocked myself when I found out it's pretty cool to meet people other than your own race. I enjoy being with my people and all, but sometimes in life you have to step out and do something for yourself. If I had a went to a school with most of the people I already knew I probably wouldn't make any new friends which isn't good. I need to get a job when I get back to Houston. What time is it. What time does my Psychology class begin. It begins at 3:30 so I still have plenty of time. Let me put my folder into my bag so that I won't leave it here. Boy I sure don't feel like walking to class in this heat. Burdine hall is too far away. I know that it's good exercise and all, but I just don't feel like walking. I don't see how people can stand to live in Austin. There is nothing here to do, but go to school. At least I haven't seen anything here that would make me want to live here. I need to turn the tv volume down a little so that I can really think. I'm going to work out today. It feels good to work out. My roommate is probably wondering what am I still doing typing on the computer because I have been on the computer for almost and hour and I've been typing for almost 20 minutes straight with slight hesitation. So what is Prof Pennebaker going to do with all these thoughts when he reads them. My head is itching and it is too cold up in this building. "
Tell me about yourself.,"My head hurts so bad right now, why. I need more tea, I'm thirsty. what do I have to do tomorrow. bio. lab, lots of reading. that sucks, I wonder how many pages I actually have to read, like 4 chapters. ew. I need to turn in this form to the health office, actually I'm not sure where I need to turn it into, I should call Alexis and find out. I wish I had frozen yogurt right now. I need a job. where are my roommates are. my head hurts so bad right now. I need to get one of those egg crate things for my bed, I think that'll help my back, I'm so tired, I need to take a nap. I need to do homework. I should call my mom later and tell her about the stress causes immune suppression thing, what's my brother is doing. I should call my dad too, I haven't talked to him like four weeks. I need to send him the letter I wrote. wow, my head really hurts. I should call Lora and see if she is going to be in College Station this weekend. I wonder why her and her boyfriend broke up, he is a jerk, oh well. I need to call Ashley and tell her to buy me a gift for Jena's birthday this weekend. I wish it was my birthday, I need a vacation already. how many tests I have next week. Adam's coming next week, what time does his flight come in, I should call him tonight and find out. what time does he get off work, I need to find a nice place for us to eat, what's on sixth street, I should call Ashely she had know. I need to clean my room before friday. yesterday was grandparents day I think, I need to call my grandma. I want to go to New York for the winter break. I'm so tired right now. Sept. 11 is this week, wow, that is like two years, goodness. wow. I need to go to the grocery store. oh yay, Amy's home. this should be fun, except not at all, I wonder if she is driving to class tomorrow, I should get a ride, I hate riding the bus. I hate standing up on the bus. I think it should be a rule that if you're a boy you have to stand up for girls on the bus. my first class is at 10 in the morning. I have so much to read. did I take my medicine this morning. I think. I can't believe how much I forget lately, I need to get that checked out. Sarah's team is playing us in a volleyball tournament this weekend, I should call her and see what time so I can go watch, Staci is coming in this weekend. oh, that's going to be so much fun. we should go downtown. I need money. I need a job, I wonder if I can get a job here at the apartment complex, I bet that'd lower my rent. all of a sudden I stopped capitalizing my I's . I think it makes me type faster. that's neat, I love my smell-good candle, my head hurts, how long does advil take to work, I need to go check my mail . when's our electric bill due? I'm hungry, what did I eat today. I need to buy more milk and sweet n low. I'm not going to the grocery store till sunday, oh, I have to get my film developed before monday, I should take it to one hour photo, at the grocery store. I wonder what Alexis is doing, I should go chill with her instead of reading for bio. discussion. I need to clean my room and do laundry before this weekend, oh my stomach hurts too. I wonder if I took my ulcer medicine this morning, I need to get my prescription filled. I have to go register to vote in Austin this week, or next week maybe. oh my gosh my head is killing me this sucks. oh my 20 minutes are up. "
Tell me about yourself.,"This is my first year here at the University of Texas and I am very overwhelmed with all of the expectations. It is so hard for me because I have had to learn how to get around in such a large town, on such a huge campus, and living on my own for the first time is crazy. I have to find a job because I need to be able to pay my bills and I still have so much school work that I have to keep up with. At the Junior College I attended everything was very personal and it was easy to talk to a teacher or advisor whenever you needed to. Here everything is done over the computer which I guess is good since we are in the electronic age, but I just like the old fashioned way of pen and paper and face to face. I miss my family, especially my sister. I moved here by myself and I really don't know anybody here in Austin. I've never had to do so much walking in my life!  I guess I should get all the exercise that I need walking back and forth to my classes. I'm worried that I won't be able to keep up in classes. I think I'm just nervous because everything has been a big change and I'm still very overwhelmed by all of it. I just wish sometimes that it would be a little bit easier and people would be a little bit more explanatory about things. Twenty minutes is a long time to write. I never thought I would feel pressured to think. I guess my thoughts don't come that often or just don't continue for twenty minutes straight. I still have ten more minutes to write. I wonder how these will be graded. I have so much to do today. I need to wash clothes, go to the grocery store, I have to clean since a friend is coming to visit me this weekend, and I have a test I have to start studying for. I hope the test won't be too difficult. I always worry about the first tests in a class. They pretty much set the tone for the rest of the semester. If you do really bad, then you have to bust your butt for the rest of the semester, if you do good then your pretty much set for a successful semester. I wish that all teachers would do a review. Reviews for tests really help me to learn the material because I end up going over it again and again. I guess its really repetition that makes me learn. Man, I still have five more minutes to write. I have never been in a class that was as big as this psychology class. I was totally blown away by the amount of students that are in that class. I bet its really hard to teach to an audience of that size. There must be so many distractions for the professor because I know I get distracted just sitting there. In an auditorium you can hear so many noises because of the echoes, sometimes your focus drifts away. I think that I'm going to like this class. It seems like it will be interesting and fun. I think that if every class was interesting and fun, then the college would be full of 4. 0 students walking down the street. My finance class is one of the classes that interests me the very least. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am thinking right now that this is kind of difficult. I don't want everyone to know my personal thoughts. I guess I have to do it anyway to make a good grade on this. I need to get everything done so that I can go home. I have to clean my room and do the psychology experiment, which takes a long long time. I don't know what to expect from it either. Oh well, it's required so I am going to do it. I can't wait to go home because when I do I get a snow cone. That might sound juvenile to be happy about something like that, but there are a lot of people who like them. I especially like pink lemonade with ice cream in the middle. I think I might get that. I always get it though. I guess I don't like to try new things. This is actually kind of fun. My friend Monica is in this class too. Are ya'll going to take off for backspaces?  I don't even know if ya'll can see when we erase stuff. I am a fast typer, but I make a lot of mistakes. That's why I am saying that I erase. My friend Monica also made me a cd. It's really good. It's funny because it has songs on it that apply to my life. Well not necessarily my life, but a boy in my life. I'm very confused about him. I'm not saying that he is gay. I just don't know what to do. It seems that I have been thinking and talking about him all the time. I e-mailed him and everything. I think that if you think about something too much it gets boring after awhile. You just confused yourself even more. What happened with him is that we liked each other, but I didn't know what I wanted from our relationship and so I guess I got scared. Now I don't know what to do. I always say that if it is meant to be it will be later. God is the only one that knows the future. That's what I don't like. I wish I just knew all the answers to everything. Man I just lost my train of thought. That's not cool. Anyway this writing assignment is pretty easy. I think it helps to get things out. We think a lot. Gahlee. My grammar is bad. Oh well, it doesn't really matter. Let me think of something else to talk about. Hmmmmm, I guess I can talk about my room mate. Maybe tell stories. Not bad ones of course. I'll write down how we met. I was really afraid that I would be shy at orientation since I was in high school. High school was crap. I wasn't made fun of and stuff. I was just ready to get out of there. I went to orientation and she was my roommate there because we are both in Preview which is a group that takes summer school and they pay for everything except for $350 of it. It actually helps you a lot. You get 6 hours of credit for $350 and you make a lot of friends. That's actually where I met that guy. Monica and I got a long really well. It seems that we are exactly alike. That's really cool. She lives in San Antonio. Well, she is from there she lives here. Ok so we met and I was pretty outgoing which is a good thing. I have changed a lot. I changed when I got here. I think that is weird because usually it takes me a long time to get used to a place. You get off track in these things easily. I was just thinking a second ago about how I went to my pal teacher's class and it threw me off. I thought of it because I talked about how different it has been coming here. My friend and I went to her class so that we could see her and she ended up making us talk about college. I miss Pals so much. It was a lot of fun just really difficult sometimes. It was kind of like Preview in a way. People could get in your business easily. I can't stand it when people don't mind their own business. That's funny because I am really nosey myself. Not in the sense that I like to learn everything about everyone's personal lives just that I am curious about everything. I really like this cd. She did a good job. Daniel, Monica's b/f is coming to visit her this withe. I hope that ya'll know what b/f and withe mean. Monica really likes him I think. He seems like a really sweet guy. The guy that I like is sweet too. I haven't even said his name yet. I guess I should but somethings need to remain private. Then again it's not like ya'll would know who he is. Awww friends are friends forever. I love this song. It's so sweet. Man my time is almost up that's not fun. I like doing this. I'm singing in my head. I would type that out but it would take too long. I wonder who else likes this song. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now, I am sitting here sick to my stomach and the world feels so small. I am waiting for a phone call that is so important, and if I don't get it, I am going to feel like a really big loser. Yes, I did just get all the blessings I could ever ask for, so I am selfish to be wanting more, but its something I really really want. All I want is to make my parents proud and to give my family something they can brag about. I have spent my whole life wanting to achieve the best, and I get so sick when I let myself down. Rejection sucks. its so hot in here, and as all my friends call because they just got the call,"" I feel like a loser. I am proud of myself- but rejection is not something I handle well? What if the call does not come-- will I cry, will I blame my inabilities on something else, how will I react? The anxiety I feel right now is extreme. On top of all that, I am homesick. I have a great life here in Austin, but since my family is a huge part of my life, I feel kind of left out being so far away. Everything back home seems to go on without me. my roommate here is annoying and the tv here is always on. she follows me around and sometimes I feel used because she really does not know people here. She is not in a sorority and so sometimes I feel as if she is angry at me for that. I am so anxious. my boyfriend is supportive too, but I wonder sometimes if he really has deep feelings for me. Yes, I know about his fear of commitment and all that crap, but we have been together for way too long for me not to feel totally secure with him. Oh, that stupid seventh heaven song. turn off the dang tv. All I want is peace and quiet without all the noise. Oh, and I have to worry about yesterday too. My sorority is awesome, but it makes me really uncomfortable to drink around some of them. Yes, I know. Its silly if we all drink together. But, sometimes I feel as if I have this image that I have to uphold. and that image reflects back onto all aspects of my life. my family, my faith, my school, my friends. How do I act? How do I dress? Who do I associate myself with? All of these things constantly flood my brain, and sometimes all I want to do is get far away from those thoughts. Do people love me for me? Do they love me for who I am here or the grades I make or the house I live in or the money my parents make? How do people view me? And that tv, always on. what I would give for that chatter to stop for 10 minutes. I can't even study with the noise. I am worried about this year. I need a job, I have bills to pay, I am in hard classes. how will I measure up? I love my life, I love my life. but I could seriously do without the stress. I am determined, and I already have accomplished so much this semester, but will it end? I want it to stay this way, but there is so much to lose. I am scared that I will lose it. How do I not lose it? I pray all the time, and I count my blessings. its hot in my apartment and it smells like paint. why did I choose to live in an apartment with a girl I don't like? What possessed me to do this? Did I feel independent and like a big girl? Now I feel young and naive, and way out of my league. oh, the insanity, but good things come to those who wait and I put all my trust into a higher being so things WILL work out. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Crap, I was half way through this assignment and my computer just cut out or something. I really hope it didn't already submit because I don't want to screw up my credit for this paper. Great, now I'm completely paranoid that I've managed to screw up something so simple. I'll keep my fingers crossed. I need all the help I can get to do well in this class. Actually, I haven't worried about my grades in a long time. When tests start, I'll panic. It's really hard to focus in my morning classes during lectures. I never get enough rest. My schedule's all out of order. I can't fall asleep until around two or three and then have to wake up at seven. I'm tired all day long. I hear my TV and want to go watch it. I always put stuff off and watch too much television. I have a problem with procrastinating. I never used to be this bad. I'm scared that since I can't get on a study plan, I'll fail. I hate it when I over use a word when I'm writing. I feel like I haven't written enough, but does length matter?  My birthday is next week, which somewhat depresses me. I'm not close to any of my friends, and I'm scared they're going to forget about me. I feel like the only loser out of my friends who's not having this great college experience. It's not that I'm homesick, just kind of restless and bored. I haven't met that many people and frankly, feel like an outcast. My head hurts, but I have no tylenol. I hate swallowing pills. I used to break them up and put them in yogurt. I'm such a wuss. My roommate went home for the afternoon. I'm glad she is gone. She can be a little much with the extreme cleanliness. I went out of town one weekend, and she made my bed. I don't really want her invading my space and touching my things. "
Tell me about yourself.,"So here goes. I am really starting to stress out about all this college stuff. It seems like my to-do list just keeps getting longer and the time I have to complete everything just keeps shrinking. I hope and pray that as time goes by I will learn to better deal with all the pressures associated with college life. It has been so hard to find a way to balance the fun with the work. But as my brother once told me, you must work hard in order to play hard. I'm trying to keep that thought in my head constantly, and keep thinking positive about my situation. I'm hoping that I can pull it off and walk away from this first semester satisfied with my accomplishments and confident about my college semesters to come. Well enough about that. I'm really starting to miss my family a lot. I think that is really lame but I can't help it really. Like I love Austin and school and everything but there is just something about my good ole hometown of Sunnyvale, Texas that I miss incredibly. I went home last weekend and had a blast reuniting with all my old friends. Gosh I love my friends here but its just not the same. There is just something about the familiar that keeps me constantly wanting to latch on to it and never leave. But I know that that is impossible for someone like me who constantly strives to better myself and achieve my goals. And UT is the place to do it. I love this place! The people sometimes freak me out but its nice to be exposed to strange people for a change. I am so excited about this weekend! One of my best friends from back home is coming to visit and I keep thinking about what we are going to do all weekend! Gosh you know what. I'm really starting to worry about the whole freshman 15"" theory! Because I sure do eat a lot these days. The food is just constantly in front of you so its difficult to resist! Its not like at home where you have to make yourself something because your mom refuses to wait on you. No here the food is just there and all you have to do is go to it! Its great! Its amazing to me how different college life is from high school. Like in high school everyone cared about everyone else's business and there were like cliques and stuff but not here. No one cares about anyone else's business at all. people are just concerned with themselves. And another thing that is so great is the total absence of rules! Like you can do whatever the heck you want and NO ONE will tell you that you are wrong or that you can't do something. Oh it really makes me laugh how in college classes if you suddenly get the desire to get up and walk out of class while the professor is talking, you can! I laugh every time I see people doing that in my classes. I would never be able to make myself do that because I'm too much of a chicken but I think its so funny! Gosh. I'm really starting to get hungry again. that is so bad! NO! I can't eat again! I am really not looking forward to going to class again at 7pm. that is really late and I'm extremely tired! I really hope that I can find a date to Anchors Away. that is really bugging me. I wish I knew exactly who I wanted to take and who wanted to go so that I wouldn't have to worry about it anymore! Alright well the time on this thing is officially almost over so I'm going to stop babbling about stuff that no one is interested in except for me. haha! This was good. its kind of a way to let your problems go all at once. I actually feel better to get all this out and see my thoughts on paper. Not to mention that I feel better knowing that this writing assignment is out of my hair so that is one less thing I have to worry and stress out about. Well that is all I have to say for myself at this point and time! Peace! "
Tell me about yourself.,"ben stiller and his movies crack me up I wish I was up stairs watching it right now and not writing for 20 minutes on what is on my mind but maybe this way I will tap into my subconscious or something my girlfriend is not answering her phone but she always does I wonder what she is doing. I'm happy that I'm going to dallas to see her but last night she was making me mad by hanging around other guys and at all these parties. I like ut but I think I would have a much better time at smu with her, not only would I be with her a lot more but I like the school better and its not so overwhelming and is a lot smaller. I feel bad for lying to her the other night about having our neighbors, some girls over, but whatever I mean she goes over to guys apts to hang out and I mean since I'm the dominant male figure I guess that inviting girls over means that you like them or something. whatever it just does not register right, I mean like its cool for her to go to a guys apt, but its not for me to have chicks over, like that is not fair and Its not like I like any of these girls its just that I want to be social and have girls as friends just as much as she does. you know its weird that I have these feelings but I almost feel like I could spend the rest of my life with her. she is fun witty sexy as hell blonde rich great person in her heart and I think everything that a guy would want, although she has great things about her there is also some downsides. like in party situations I always find her wondering off and talking to her friends and when I come up to her she acts almost as if she does not know me. is she ashamed? I don't think so but it could seem that way to others. but maybe its because I do it to, I mean when I'm at a party I like to be with my friends to so I guess were both guilty. damn that movie meet the parents is funny and I want to go watch it badly and I have only typed for 10 min, o well halfway done. so its like the glass is half full not half empty because I am a positive, optimist. I like the new book jarrett gave me. sometimes I'm just real un positve about things and a book on being positive can help me out in life and with school. this interview or presentation I went to last night for this sales company was pretty cool I think I could potentially make some money doing it but as I sat there and listened to this over-energetic guy talk about oh yea you can make all this money and blah blah blah I thought to myself this is just one of those get rich quick schemes because at the end of this thing you pay 50 for a application and some of there products, what company just lets you sit through a presentation and BAM you got the job. jarrest going to do it so I think since he has been successful in his endeavors with business and sales I think hey why not give it a try what is the worst that can happen. Bud sounds good right now although I have not smoked in a while I wonder why, I guess its cause I act different when I'm stoned and maybe I don't like it, I like to get high after I workout cause for some reason it feels good and makes me feel as if I'm not just a lazy pothead, is pennebaker going to care that I'm talking about this? o well that is what is on my mind so take it or leave it jk. yea I'm almost done with this , I thought this was going to be a formal paper with research and stuff but what a badass assignment, I think I'm going to like this teacher unlike my eco teacher Wolitz I can't stand her ugly face and bad teaching I just don't like her you know just one of those ppl. I bombed her test today to because she is boring and does not make the class want to learn anything. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am so hungry. I Can't wait until lunch in 40 minutes. I'm going with my twin sister and our new friend Kristin. she is my sorority sister. I love being in a sorority. I'm kinda nervous though, I hope I make a lot of friends. I hate this song that is playing, its so annoying. I really want to change the station. I can't wait, I want some pretzel and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. and some fruit, definitely a banana. I'm worried that the peanut butter is going to make me fat. I'm not used to the food here, even thought I don't really look fat, I feel a little fatter, but I'm not eating bad junk food, just normal food, but its not like the food from home. plus I'm not getting as much exercise here, its just so hard to fit everything in, and I'm not in a schedule yet, I hate that. but I really want to be more easy going. school I scaring me right now, I'm worried because we have not had any tests yet so I don't really know what any of them are going to be like, so I don't know how I will do, and I'm not at all used to doing bad, I always get high a's and I don't know if that will happen here. I hope a good song comes on now that one finally ended! so anyways I'm really really freaked out because my hair is falling out. like I sit here and . wait I love this song! I want to turn it up. anyways I think its because of all the stress I'm under. this happened to me earlier this summer and then I winced I finally relaxed it stopped, but its like a chain reaction because I get stressed and worried so my hair falls out and then once I see my hair falling out I get even more stressed and worried because it always looks so bad in a pony tail and when its down it just never looks good any more and it makes me feel ugly so that stress me out more and I continue to worry and it just does not stop. last week was really hard but this week I think I'm more used to everything so hopefully I will stop stressing so much because its not really doing me any good, I just want to have so much fun at college and I totally am. I really like all the friends I have made so far. I have a really fun group of girls in my dorm we call ourselves kin's klan lol. we all live at kinsolving, I m so happy that we are friends and that we have so much fun together. I can't wait to start making some good guy friends. it sucks because they are always so drunk whenever I meet them so they never remember my name even though we've met like 20 times but that happens to everyone. I'm not really hungry anymore but I just want to go to lunch and see my friends. o crap I have to go to stupid calculus after that and I really don't want to go and watch my t/a get chalk dust all over himself he is such a mess and I can't understand him at all I hope I am able to figure out the last five problems today so that I don't have to do it anymore and I can just submit the answers and get one thing done. o yah I have to ask eklly about chemistry I hope she remembers how to convert celcius to ferenhright and how to calculate water displacement because I definitely don't remember. ooo my fingers are tired. but I like typing lol. I'm really enjoying reading all this psychology stuff its fun but at the same time I'm totally self diagnosing myself. I'm like oo my neurotransmitters are so messed up and I need drugs for these and I need drugs for these I think its kinda funny at the same time. I can't wait until our mixer tomorrow night with sae it is going to be awesome. and then the match on friedya I really want to dress up whitetrash but that will be weird wehn we go to ato which we willdef do because I'm a totally ato groupie and I'm still dressed in my white trash outfit. the music is out how annoying it must not have good reception. I never listen to music here anymore and I barely watch tv I kinda like that there is just too much other stuff to do and if there is time to relax then there is time to do homework which I always haved or time to hang out wiht kins klan or time to sleep. I really need more sleep I just took a 20minute nap in between my two last classes it was great I love feeling so refreshed I felt like I slept for hours. why can't I feel that good in the morning? ewww that morning that makes me think of the disgusting yogurt they had in the cafeteria, first it was not mixed. like I could see gross water in it so I mixed it and then it was plain,. who serves plain yogurt. op I'm hungry again. and know I have to go to the bathroom. I hope I get used to community bath soon because its so weird like just uncomfortable I don't want to listen to other girls going to the restroom lol. o well I'm sure ill get over it its only the 3rd week but it feels like I have been here forever I love it so much freedom and I can do anything I want it will be so weird going home next summer. next summer we already have to be renting apartments for next year its way to early I have only lived here for 3 weeks I hope I get good roommates and live in a fun complex like either the new new villas or the new boardwalk that would be crazy fun,, maybe a little too much fun lol I hope I'd be able to get my work done o well I can't wait to have so much fun. I really think I would be nice to meet a cute /nice guy here. ugh I'm tired of typing but enjoying this stream of consciousness thing its a good way to think umm I need to call my mom and tell her she owes me some money! yah but not really I had to go pay for a text book myself so I need to get paid back for that I feel like all I do here is spend money I just want everything I see thank goodness for bevo bucks and dine in dollars speaking of bevo I also most got a tattoo of a longhorn on my butt last week but now that I have had time to think about it I'm not so sure but I think It would be totally awesome if I did it   "
Tell me about yourself.,"hmmm. at 18, my life thus far has been where I want it. The USMC has given me the newfound sense of self one craves after a monotonous high school career. Football, basketball, summer activities, UIL academic meets, clubs, and band, they say, will be the things you cherish for the rest of your life. Memories. They will be the best years of your life say those who never went to college. The next 4 will be your best years of your life. "" say those who have. But will they be? The Crucible was more difficult than anything I could ever imagine attempting, but I made it. Lying in a pit covered in barbed wire and mud and feeling the wildest sense of dread, failure, hatred, anger for being awake for 3 days with only 2 MRE's to last the entire ordeal. Feeling that the sun would never set. Being away from my family and everything that I loved for a quarter of a year with no means of contact besides staying up after lights out, sitting on a stone cold toilet in the head because it was the only source of light by which to write. Knowing that you're giving up the sleep, the rest, that will carry you through the next day. Hate towards the others in the platoon for their Goddamn stupidity, hard-headed, fight without listening to reason, their never-ending bitching and trying to hold an edge over everyone else. It's a real life world of shit. Brings to mind that show on MTV called ""Oz"", haven't seen but advertisements for it. Prisoners talking about ""the hard life"" of prison. What do they have that I didn't have at MCRD San Diego. Prison vs. Boot Camp. They have TV, books, newspapers, double ply toilet paper, free time, phone calls, a weight room, good food, the right to lay on the rack whenever they wish, the right to sit down, cigarettes, the ability to do whatever the hell they want. What did I have? Not a single one of those things. A month in the desert, worrying that one of North America's pit vipers or coral snakes would find its way into my sleeping bag as I slept on a rocky desert floor, or the guy next to you on the firing line would trip and put a 5. 56mm round into your back, or falling while hiking without light on a steep slope in the middle of a moonless night with 80 pounds of gear and splitting my grape on a rock. Days go by slow when you're having a bad day at the office or in the classroom. Time is suspended when you're so miserable that you would almost rather die than continue through the rest of training It was a different sort of feeling felt in life. Hadn't had if before. but I miss it. I'd never felt so alive. What we take for granted in life: friends, our favorite book, the faithful German Shepherd, a home cooked meal, a grassy lawn, a drive down a country road that reminds you of your childhood. those are given new meaning. The feeling of infinite pride, accomplishment, belonging, knowing that you live your life not for the boss, not for others, not for money, not for possession, and knowing that you cannot be defeated. I felt that during Marine Corps graduation. That is what I will remember and cherish in life. Throwing the ""greatest party"", making $100 grand a year vs $40, driving an Aston Martin. What does that crap mean if you don't truly own yourself? Like those who fawn over celebrities or drive expensive cars that their ego thrives on but their families at home cannot afford. They will never know the meaning of life. I know that I may never be the investment banker that all college kids know they will be, but I will have a rich life. I will not be the movie star that everyone knows they will be, but I know that I will be loved by those who matter to me. I look forward to the future. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am pretty tired today. I haven't had much sleep in the last couple of weeks. I have been working pretty hard and now with school starting it is going to be even busier. I work with the youth group at the church I go to. It is getting very busy there as well. We are really trying to get the numbers back up. After the summer the kids seemed to move away and the number of kids seemed to falter a little. Right now I am making a pot of coffee and getting ready to put in a hard day of studying. I was supposed to go to work today but there is nothing for us to do so we are staying home. We are working construction on our new church building. It is very exciting. We have to do a lot of demolition, and to help us out the fire department said they had some guys to train to breech walls. So for the last week they have been breaking through walls. It has been really cool to watch. My coffee smells really good. I am listening to some Audio Adrenaline. They are a Christian band I just downloaded. They sound pretty good, nothing that great about them though. I am switching majors this semester from Engineering to a dual major in History and Spanish, pretty drastic transfer huh?  I think it will be good. I got accepted into the UTeach program and so starting this semester I will be in an Austin public school teaching and observing. I will be in the classroom starting next week. I am very excited. My arms are getting really tired from writing so much and it has only been six minutes. I think they are going to fall off. I have a lot to do today. Since I am not working it will give me a good opportunity to catch up. I think I will be pretty far behind in this class PSY 301 because the Co-OP does not have the book(it is out of stock) They won't have it until Monday the 8th. I'll just have to read a lot next week. I need to do laundry today and maybe clean my truck. I am trying to sell my truck. It is a big beast and gets horrible gas mileage. About 10 miles per gallon. I think I will put it on Auto trader and see what I can get for it there. My coffee is done and it is calling my name. Come. Drink me. ""   I guess I will just have to wait another. oh my gosh. 10 minutes. I am losing my thoughts because my arms hurt so bad and I am really tired. I have to read six books for my History class. It's not so bad I have alreay read one of them and have started on another. The first was very boring. I think the rest will get better. This is a good song. I am also taking Chem 302 I think it will be a challenge because I don't really remember Chem 301 that well. I kind of breezed through it and didn't really learn any of the material. What other classes do I have?. I am trying to teach myself Spanish right now. It is fun. I think I can use Spanish a lot later in life. I hope to do some missionary work and maybe go into youth/college ministry. But who knows what the big guy has in store for me. College age has a lot of possibilities. I am hoping to maybe get something started this semester. I don't know how that is going to turn out but I think it will be fun. THis last summer me and a couple of friends went to Colorado did some fly fishing, landscape photography, and climbed Mt. Elbert (which is the highest peak in the Rockies @ 14,433)  It was a lot of fun. I and looking at a picture of me and my friend Chris. It is of when we went skydiving last year. That was a whole lot of fun. ""People may doubt what you say, but they will always believe what you do"". Reads a poster on my wall. I read it every day to help my fully realize how much more my actions speak than my words. I would like to be a great orator but if somebody could only know my through my life practices and not my life speeches I would want them to say that I had a heart like David "". a man after God's own heart. ""  That would be the testimony of my life. I pray that I can life according to the beliefs in which I so strongly hold. K2, Everest, Anapurna  some of the greatest peaks in the world. I someday wish to climb all of them. But we will see how things play themselves out. I think it is so funny how people grunt and groan and try to figure it all out. The things that are above. are always going to be greater than those below. And tru faith means you don't have to have all the answers. The End "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am in my room right now typing with my tv turned on to MTV channel. It's playing justin timberlake song. I just got back from my biochemistry I class and the professor in that class seems very boring. I noticed that he never stop talking in his lecture which makes it hard for me because I feel like I missed a lot of what he said while I was taking notes. I can't seem to take notes and listen well at the same time. I feel I'm more of a single tasked person. Besides the music going on in my room, the water cooker is almost, and I can hear it's boiling right now and I think I need to check on it before the water boils over. I'll be back. Well, I'm back. This week will be a tiring week for me since I have so much to catch up with anthropology reading. I pretty much understand my biochemistry professor after a few lectures of how he is not good in lecturing, so that means I have to spend more time reading and studying, which definitely sucks. My other teachers are okay and I seem to absorb a lot in their lectures. I don't think I can work out much this week and I maybe be able to work out next thursday and saturday. Plans for weekends are unsure since I haven't made any. Hopefully, there will be something fun that my friends will invite me to. I had already met some people in my dorm, but I haven't really met people in my classes. I also met the people from Longhorn Pre-Pharmacy Association. Man, there is going to be a football game this coming saturday and I don't think I can usher again in the football for the Longhorn PRe-Pharmacy since I haven't finished much in my school work and haven't played really since a long time ago. I hope this week and this weekend won't turn out to be terrible. It's unexpected that somehow right now I feel more energetic than when I was about an hour ago when I was in biochemistry class. Maybe professors have a lot of effect on student's energy level or maybe the breakfast that I ate about 3 hours ago now is starting kick in. Something about the song in MTV just made me looked at the screen. It's R. Kelly in a Japanese culture setting, which made me look longer because I am from an asian culture. In America, asian culture is not that widely dispersed, so it's good to see it every so often. As I'm watching a fighting scene in that R. Kelly MTV, I think America has a misleading view toward asian culture because whenever there is something with asian culture, there has to be martial art, which is misleading because asian culture is not just about martial art. Instead, we have other things. I don't feel like listing  them right now. It's good to see rap songs are being more popular because it shows America is diverse and multi culture. Speaking of culture, in my anthropology class, we are discussing about culture. I have a lot to read on The Forest People, who are people have very different culture from Western and Eastern culture. The book is  "
Tell me about yourself.,"I've been thinking a lot lately on the topic of studying other people, using them as test subjects, objectifying human beings, I really feel that it degrades their very being. I don't understand another human's need to study and examine what makes another human tick. I wish that I could say that I am exempt from this curiosity, but sadly I am not. I find myself hypocritically fascinated by the way that people lose themselves in their jobs, in causes, in religion. They somehow manage to pound it into their heads that whatever it is that they're involved in is important, means something, when in reality 100% of professions and causes are just as pointless as the lives of the people lost in them. None of it will rally matter once these people are gone, and the strange thing is that I think they all know this deep down, they've all had that thought in their life before. Yet they still go on, slaving their lives away, building the modern day pharaoh's modern day pyramids. Just pawns to those that were lucky enough to be born into wealth. God only knows what they would do if they were forced to face the reality of their banal situations. Which raises another good topic, religion, now everyone knows that religion is make-believe for grown ups, just another thing to keep perpetuating the myth that our lives matter in some deep and profound way. Religion as we know it was made to control the masses, sort of a justification for law, and also something that keeps people inline above law, like a conscience. But the religions that we have come up with are so ridiculous we have to implement them to our young at ages when they are too young to tell the difference between real and fake. We teach them religion as fact when they are too young to differentiate for themselves the difference between fact and fiction. It's funny that we act as if what religion we pick matters, as if one is even different that the others, they all have the same common goal to keep people living in the hierarchy, keep believing that by divine right the rich were born to a life of comfort and luxury and the poor must suffer in order for rich to have such pleasant lives. In tribal societies religion doesn't have to be forced on the new generation, rather they welcome it with open arms, just as they aren't forced to work in their lives, rather they do it out of necessity and a primal urge to conform to your own society. People allowing themselves to be controlled really bothers me, it's clear that people can live, sustain life, off very little, and will slave their lives away rather than die. However I can't comprehend how our society got to this point, where the slave drivers now wear a smile while fucking people in the ass. We somehow fib ourselves into believing we need cell phones, computers, tv's, cars, when it's a fact that none of these things even existed 50 years ago. People actually lived without any of this bullshit for 3 million years, people just like you and me, people just as smart, and just as naive. It's clear that society breeds evil not the other way around, the pilgrims committed mass genocide on the indians, but it is forgiven as they were just spreading the one right way to live, that we have so enlighten found. People lived without all this none-sense that we tell ourselves we couldn't live without for nearly 3 million years. But those are all things that no one wants you to know, except maybe Daniel Quinn, Derrick Jensen, John Zerzan, and Chuck Palahniuk. Those are the men that will save our planet and our existence if it isn't already too late. The doomsday clock is set to 40 years from now, that is the point of no return, if things stay the way that they are now, there will be no hope for the future. If we had all just stayed with animism, and believed that the earth is not something for us to own, or control, if we would acknowledge that we are the weakest animal alive in that we are totally and utterly dependent on other animals giving their lives so that we may survive, how could we take away their right to the same land we live on. But there are no classes teaching what people really want to know, what they need to know, only classes perpetuating our way of life. Only classes brainwashing the brainwashed so suddenly that we don't even notice. So why study me when there are billions of other mindless zombies in this world. Now I realize that my writing may sound bleak, as if I'm in a state of utter depression, that I'm innately sad, but it's my very strong belief that with the world the way it is everyone should, and deserves to feel the depression that haunts us all. We keep on trying to come up with ways to hide from ourselves the atrocities being carried out everyday by white collared crooks, making executioner executive decisions. But humans shouldn't need pills to control their feelings, they shouldn't need pills to make them happy, they shouldn't need pills to force their inner feelings into submission. It pains me very deeply to see the day to day transfer we are making into a controlled society, and the people that don't see it, if it isn't already here. Our phones are tapped, our emails are spied on, the government we live under even monitors what books we are checking our in order to make sure were not reading anything that could be dangerous. People wake up everyday and take zoloft, prosac, ritalin, adderol, valium, zanex, anything that will keep them from deviating from what is considered acceptable behavior, to keep them inline. Anything to keep them from focusing on how ridiculous it all is, anything to keep them so fucked up they just don't care anymore. Anything to hide the fact that the light at the end of the tunnel has gone out, there is no hope for the future we are writing now, at least none that includes us. For a species that holds it self in such hich regard, the top of the food chain, the center of the universe, in our own special classification, we sure act stupidly. If we were to open our eyes we'd see that the real criminals are the rich old men living in their mansions, with drugged up kids, both pharasudically, and illegally, allowing oppression, deforestation, slavery, pollution, and the lot to continue everyday, infact they make sure it grows, because you can't stop progress. They are very rapidly destroying any traces of another way of life with every indigenous tribe they try to save"" by spreading the word of a god that allows his people to be in a constant state of submission, so that they may enter an endless world of happiness once their life here is over. I'm here to tell you that no such place exists, god is just santa clause for adults. Where was god when the twin towers were hit, where was god when the indians were wiped out by the white man, where was god when the germans were killing the jews, where is god now when people are so cleverly brainwashed since the time they are born that they don't even notice when they're doing it to their own children. I for one would hate to be responsible for bringing another life into this god forsaken waste land. Everyday we scorch the earth with new roads, we rip the earth apart for new buildings, we destroy the earth for a made up monetary system. No one seems to see the bull shit that is going on here, before civilization no one had to work, in fact tribal people have no concept of work, they do what they have to in order to survive and they spend the rest of their time living, doing whatever it is that they want to. We have some how been duped into believing that this way of life is unacceptable, lazy, pointless, a waste, yet we fail to see that our way of life is just as pointless, just as wasteful. Only we have to lie to ourselves and children right from the day they are born, because the way we live is so heinous, so vile, so wrong that our children can't handle it, and for the most part neither can we. We could change everything in one generation, if we all started living a different way one day the whole system would collapse on itself, but we lie to ourselves and force our own minds to believe that this is right, that this is the way things must be and that there's nothing we can do about it.

Tell me about yourself.,"Seriously in my mind right now I have so many levels of thought that I can easily access by simply starting to think about something, Everything runs in these little spurts of thought but once I analyze them long enough they are all working together to form what I think is the cycle of my mind and it all works together simultaneously and perfect as the world is, because everything has its specific purpose. A lot of things that I thought before were just meaningless pieces of metal and serve no purpose in the world are really there for means of our (human) use and that is what they are specifically there for. Everything is for us. Humans. Everything. We utilize this world as it is our lemon and we must make as much lemonade for ourselves as we possibly can. This alternates from being a very good and positive thing to being a terrible and selfish thing that makes us thing that we all must worry about ourselves and no one else matters unless they are aiding us on our rise to the top of the pitcher of our own lemonade, making sure that on one takes any along the way. If someone takes our lemonade, we must simply acknowledge its loss and move on but how much is too much? When and where is the point where the lemonade that is taken is too much and we need it back? But if someone drinks it then we can't get it back, so how much lemonade do we personally owe to others if we are making much more lemonade than they are? Notice please that this lemonade is still very much so a metaphor for what we provide for this world that works specifically for us. Even the controversy in the world is there specifically to get others to be mentally in touch with ourselves and make sure that they know our way of thinking. Controversy evolves from people trying to get other people to think the way that they do. Basically, this is important in deciding which factors of society are more acceptable among a large number of people instead of just one person. The more people widely accept a thought, the more it is thought to be what we think as ""normal"" but just because a thought isn't in everyone's mind, then why do we think it is abnormal or crazy? In our minds, social situations and experiences have led most to believe that minor variations in behavior are ""weird"" but this is the main problem with our world. If everyone could just accept everyone for the way they are then no one will be right or wrong and the only controversy will be because. well there will be no controversy if everyone stops being so damn judgmental all the time, please pardon my language but I felt I must stress the importance of the statement. May I please stress it again? Damn, There I did it. There is a flaw in our perfect world and if people are wondering why they may be unhappy that is probably why. They must accept everything for the way that it is and do their best to utilize what they can without being selfish and they must utilize the time that they have in order to make their life the best that it can be. People that are typically unhappy and depressed tend to think that the world needs to be changed but if they stopped thinking like that then they would be happy with the world the way it is and they would no longer be depressed. I see the irony in my statements above because I said simply that we must accept the world for what it is, but here's the thing. I have personally not yet learned to do this because I still see the flaws of judge mentality in our world that I wish to change or eradicate: the fact that people don't just accept the world and people in their ""out of the ordinary"" state of minds for just the way that it is. Simply put. the way that it is. THE WAY THAT IT IS. If I could understand that then I believe that I will have reached a level of happiness that no one could reach. I am actually much closer to this state of bliss and happiness than I ever thought I could be. I don't think there are any major flaws in our world that I cannot look at with an open mind and. accept, if you will. I say ""if you will"" because I feel that ""accept"" may not properly convey what it is that I am trying to express. By accept, I mean. look at something with an inner peace and happiness that yes it exists and it must but why? well who knows and it is okay not to know. I need not know the meaning of everything but I have a deep appreciation for it. There it is. I HAVE A DEEP APPRECIATION FOR IT. I was trying to find the phrase that conveyed my sight of the world. I appreciate the beauty of the world and the diversity among people's personalities and I choose to embrace everyone not hoping that they will change but hoping that they will continue to open the door that is my mind. No one can say they appreciate this until they really feel it. I feel it with everything that I do and I only hope that everyone can at one point or another feel this appreciation for people and not to mention mere intimate objects produced by either nature or a human being himself. Everything is there for our pleasure and we must utilize it to our best capabilities (without bearing harm to others of course, because that is the definite point where a specific line is crossed), and this is simply our duty to the world.

Tell me about yourself.,"Wow, hell week at the chi phi really put me back. I have homework out the ass. Damn I type really slow. I wish I could type faster. This song I'm listening to wasn't so bad. The next song I don't recognize, oh yea I do , hell yaw this song is great. time sure does go by. Wow this song really fits me maybe I should just roll with it. no more stalling just go and roll with it. May I should just do it. Fine the next time I see Dina I just let her know how I feel. This writing assignment is really making me hate all of those people who type fast. Maybe I should have taken a typing class in high school. Damn this song brings back way to many memories. It always make me stop and think about the girl that I like at that time. Now I'm thinking about Dina, she is just so nice. It just kind of grew and since we started out as friends it's hard to just transition into a relationship. Hopefully the feelings are not all one sided. Well I have plenty of time I see her almost every day. But if I wait too long she will become a permanent friend and I would have lost my chance. She is also my Spanish tutor so then my Spanish will be tied to my relationship. She has so much patience for me though. She can be my sugar momma. Damn I really can't stop thinking about here. I wonder why here phone wasn't working today, I kind of glad though. I need more time to think things out and its not always to do things in the spur of the moment. The tickets I got for the game suck. I can actually spit on the rice fans from my spot. Oh well, I got an extra ticket for Dina, I'm actually glad I could only get one extra ticket. Now here friend can't come with us. I'm felling really anti-social lately. I'm not really hyper or energetic either. And have been sick with a soar throat and stuffy nose. I just want a few days to catch up. This assignment is almost over . I bet almost everyone else has more written then me. Oh well. Hey now. I have too many posters It looks like a kids room in here. I just wish I could concerto "
Tell me about yourself.,"So I'm not sure on what I'm supposed to be typing about. What I smell, taste, feel like??? Well I'm chewing gum. I've been chewing it for over like 3 hours now. I hate it when gum starts to get really hard in your mouth. My gum got hard a long time ago. But somehow the flavor is still intact. It's weird though- like with some gum, the flavor is gone after you chew it for like literally 2 minutes. However, I've noticed that Wrigley's chewing gum tends to have flavor for a very long time. There are many pictures on my wall. I stuck all these pics up like 2 days ago. There are pictures of my friends, one of my dog, and one of me and my sis. I don't have one of my family up there. I kind of feel bad in a way. But I don't think it's necessary to have them up on the board. I have a picture of them in my drawer if I ever need to see them. But I think it's better with them in my drawer. Every time I look up at these pictures of all my friends, I miss them like no other. Man, I had so much fun last year, in high school in general. But last year was definitely the best year. Man, me, Caroline, and Shaheen in government and Spanish. Those were some good times. I kind of even miss my teachers. And our elephants and doing SCN all the time. We have so many inside jokes. And although I'm sure I'll see Caroline again, I'm afraid that when I meet her things won't be the same. And for some reason I'm scared of that. I hope I can go to LSU in the spring. Or actually, I hope Caroline can come to Houston for Thanksgiving. Or both would be the best. And we can't forget about going to Europe next summer. I'm so used to traveling with friends because we always went on vacation with Xerx and Zahra. But now with this whole separation thing, I know that our traveling days with the Tegra family are over. Those were some fun trips too. I feel so blessed to have a friend like Xerx. And even Zubin and stuff. People that I've known my whole life. That even know I don't see them too often, when I do, you can tell that there's something there. Like I feel so close to them cause I practically grew up with them and their parents are like my parents. It's a really nice feeling. I'm also blessed for Shenz and the whole family. God, Shenz and Fred really do care about me and Tash like we were their own kids. And just knowing that really means a lot to me. And I hope that mom feels the same way about Zareen cause that would only be fair. So we're talking about fairness in my freshman seminar class and I'm thinking that maybe this class isn't going to be that easy after all. But I love the Professor; we call him Dr. EO. Hahaha, he's really cool. Like I walk into his class and he's like ""do you want a drink?"" Wow, I was like thinking ""what is this?"" Oh, and his classroom is in his office which have weird scary looking statues of people's heads. The office kind of reminds me of the The Vinci Code. I don't know why, maybe the whole ""Louvre"" idea. I always say I hate France and stuff but I really don't. I just think it's kind of funny to say that. But I really don't know why it's funny. But I mean I've said it so many times now that I really think I've instilled the idea into my head. Like I really don't want to travel to France in the summer. But I mean if Caroline wants to, then I really don't care. I think I'm pretty easy going when it comes to life. Like about my grades- I mean if I don't so well in college, what's going to happen to me? I mean, I'm still going to get a job and all, hopefully get into a good grad school. But I mean if for whatever reason I don't, then I think I'll be ok. I mean, it's not like I'm going to die or anything. Plus, if I have my own family then I don't think I'll be able to work and have the kids and stuff. Man, it's a complicated issue. We got a phone in our room, the same one I had in my room at home. But I haven't used it once here. If anything, Jennifer has used it way more than me. Man, I haven't even given anyone the number to this phone cause I don't want them calling in case they call when I'm not here and then have to talk to Jennifer. I'm not sure what I'm more afraid of, them talking to Jennifer or Jennifer talking to them. No, but Jennifer's really cool. But so is Joanna's roommate. Man, I wish I had a roommate like her. Dude, me and Jennifer need to start hanging out more often. But I never want us to have the same friends. John is one of Jennifer's friends. Majoring in Japanese and stuff. Wow, that's cool, especially since he's white and all. I've always wanted to take some random language like Japanese. I don't know, it's like you gain more respect if you fluently learn a language that is so not from where you are. Like me learning a African language and spe "
Tell me about yourself.,"This must be the easiest and hardest writing assignment ever. There is nothing easier in a writing assignment when context and grammar doesn't matter, but there's nothing harder when one has nothing to write about. OK, how am I feeling? Hmm. I have a light headache and my contacts are bothering me. Right when I wrote ""light"" headache, it started to hurt even more.        Anyways, in class Pennebaker did this statistical project or what not between people who are afraid of death are more likely to support Bush. Then, people who are more terrified of terrorists are more likely to support Bush. Hmm. I on the other hand, am not terrified of terrorist because I support Bush and feel safe with his leadership. That's how I would see it. If you are not afraid of terrorism, then you must think that Bush is doing a fantastic job with keeping America safe.        Oh man, it's only been five minutes and my wrists are already starting to hurt. hmm, maybe I'll just type slower.         My eyes are bothering me. Man this really sucks that I can't use the tab button to indent. I don't really want to keep pressing the space button because I am lazy and my wrist hurts. Ok forget any form of organization. I'll just babble about nothing. My eyes are watery. I bet it's due to my stupid contacts. My nose is runny too. Hehehe snot is gross. I wonder when anyone will ever read this. Never. Completion grade. Yay! Ok what am I thinking. I am thinking that I need to think of something so I can type whatever that thing is that I think ok. This is hurting my brain. I bet this is great for my headache. Wow, nine minutes already. This looks pretty lengthy. Ok I am positive that no one will ever read this. I mean who is going to read 300 plus random thoughts. Wow I just felt pressure to make mine interesting and jestful. What if mine is the most boring writing essay. No way, I bet that there's way more boring-er people than I am. I am just so cool like that. hehe no not really. Ok ::sigh:: 11 minutes. Wow. Time just slowed down. Ok I'm out of things to think once again. I rather be sleeping. It's in the afternoon and I just had lunch. I want to take a nap. Like pigs, they take a nap after they eat. I'm a pig. Only one minute has passed. What is this assignment suppose to prove. That class is composed of 300 hamsters in an experiment. Don't get me wrong. I don't mind. I'm in a fishbowl. Who's not a fishbowl? I am getting very sleepy. hehe I just thought of those guys who use a watch to hypnotize someone till they fall asleep and they say ""you are getting very sleepy"" in this creepy tone. well I feel like one of those guys being hypnotized. yayayaya! only 5 minutes to go! wow this is the best writing assignment ever. this should count for %50 of our grade. it's only fair. ok ok ok what am I thinking? I am thinking that I should be thinking of something to think of. ha that was gay. I'm hungry already and I just ate rice and steak. man I am a pig. I just have a big stomach capacity, I can't help it. headache. snot. itchy eyes. 3 minutes to go. I would be so mad if this whole thing got erased. hmm I wonder what everyone else is writing about. oh no, what if theirs is more articuling and witty. oh well I don't care. I hate competition. ha-ha ut's the best place for that. oh my gosh the count down begins. we have seconds left ladies and gentlemen. After much ado this fun is coming to an end. I must say it has been lots of fun. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Today has not been a very good day for me. I found out that my roommate is secretly dating my ex-boyfriend behind my back. My friend and I caught them together last night in the courtyard outside of my dorm. This is one of the worst feeling I have ever felt. I am dating a boy right now, but  the feelings for my ex have started to resurface. She fully knows that I like him, but she is deceiving me. I was very irritable today and I was rude to a lot of people. I really am not a rude person, I just do not understand why people find it necessary to take advantage of my niceness. I went to Pappasito's last night to pick up some to go food. It is sitting in my refrigerator and I am very anxious to eat it. I already had some chips, salsa, queso, and guacamole today. I love Mexican food. I have a French test tomorrow. This is our second test. I thought I made an A on the last test, but when I got it back I found a much lower grade. It upset me, so I am going to study very hard for this test. Right now I have a 4. 0 at the university, and I want to keep it as close to that as possible. I have noticed while typing this that I never capitalize 'I'. I have gone back and fixed my work at least ten times. I am used to typing informally online, where grammar and capitalization does not matter. My roommate just left for an environmentalist meeting, and I wanted to go read some of her AIM logs. So, I walked over to her computer and was starting to read some when the door started to shake and I thought I heard  her key in the door. I was so scared that she was going to come in and catch me. From that experience I have realized that I don't want to be snooping in her stuff anymore. It would not be worth it if she came in and caught me. We already are going to be on semi-bad terms after I talk to her tonight about Chris. One of our good friends thinks that once I talk to her about it she will drop the whole thing. He said that she felt really bad about going behind my back and she knew it was ""too good to be true"". Oh come on. She met him like three days ago, there is no way she likes him that much. It just hurts me so bad to know that she ignores our friendship  and goes after something that she knows will hurt me. Last night our friend talked to her about it and told her that she needed to drop it or else neither of us would talk to her. She told him that she was not sure what she wanted to do because Chris is ""special"". That is what got to me the most. She is willing to throw away two friendships for a boy she just met like 3 days ago. I am already stressed out enough with school, I do not need roommate problems. This is the reason I do not hang out with girls, they do this sort of thing to each other. My guy friends have never hurt me intentionally like this. When they try to get to me, they use force. Like one time my guy friends all attacked me with pillows. It got frustrating, but I did not get emotionally hurt by it. Girls get you in the worst possible way. Tonight Mean Girls is showing at the Union. I want to go see it so bad because I love that movie. It is so good. I would go see it if I did not have to do all of this homework. I already had a test last week in French, I am upset that there is another one this week. Our teacher also assigns us homework on the night before our test. It is safe to say that we are going to be studying for the test, so there is no need to assign homework. Oh well. I have not done laundry since I arrived here in Austin. I am down to my last pants and shorts. I will probably do some tonight, if I don't get too lazy. I have treated this writing assignment as like a journal. I have a lot of stuff on my mind from this whole roommate thing, so it is good that I could write it all out. It has been kind of hard to keep writing constantly. My hand are getting kind of numb. I think it is because I never use the shift key to capitalize things, and now I have to. Well, my time has come to an end. Time to get back to more homework. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I just read in Alfred Adler's Understanding Human Nature that a person's psyche and action is driven by an ultimate goal, and that that goal is irreversibly influenced by experiences, emotions, failures, and other memories from childhood. And I consider how closely indeed my present ambitions are tied to my trauma and exhilaration as a young child. Now, I feel the only way I can attain happiness is to create something. To form a tangible pillar of my individuality and soul. I need to see my doubt, anger, passion, fear, fascination, and every substance of my mind materialize. Now, in this search to form and mold the outer world, I turn to literature, to books and stories of others, tales with which I can empathize and understand. My hunger for reading is insatiable. Everything from novels, to scientific articles, to textbooks, to philosophical papers, I want it all. I want to absorb it so that I don't miss an ounce of life. I want to share every shape and substance of time, to reflect on all thoughts before me so that I can mold those after. And in all of this, with all the knowledge, as I absorb the mind of others through their literary creations, I feel great anxiety in that I have not made a contribution of my own. Many projects that I saw as the key to overcoming this inaction and dullness have fallen short. My passions flow like a liquid, undulating and turning over, never constant, never culminating into a final insight or enlightenment. Several novels begun on my own, yet my mind drifts to other settings, other plots and themes, other characters and personalities. I can never immerse myself in the fictitious, because my own thoughts are unstable. The worlds I put on paper dissolve, evaporate and disintegrate into the torrent of my consciousness. I am always looking forward to what I will be, what I could possibly become, my intellect, my insight, my ambition, the materialization of all my passions. And it fills me with great anxiety, dread that the person inside of my my never emerge. And I think back to my early life. My parents. Childhood. When everything rested on today, on that ice cream cone after enduring an afternoon of chores, on that TV show that I've waited for all night. These were simple pleasures, now caught up in the mad flood of responsibility and maturation. It makes me so tired to look forward. To never be now. My parents were demanding. Good grades, a clean room, church attendance, moral infallibility. Always left behind in someone's expectations. Enslaved to your own dedication and attachment. I loved them then. Cherished them. Everything I did was to attain their approval. Then I would dismiss any pleasure if only for a few words of gratitude or a compliment. An ovation of some sort. I need approval. I still do. My father was a loner, and now I am a hermit as well. He never shared his thoughts. Compassion, empathy, conversation, all foreign in the house. I made up games to express myself. My imagination was as abundant as the grown-up books I read. The stuff everyone else hated. The big thick books on science, philosophy and religion. When people were still learning their multiplication tables. Science fiction. Fantasy. Anything that made life a little more exciting and unpredictable. And I wanted to escape. Straight A's, top of all my classes, and only a pat on the back. Still not good enough, because no one would share it. They wanted to play outside, go to the bayou, ride bikes, play in puddles, watch a movie, go to a party, raise hell. I just wanted to be alone. With my books. My imagination. And I've never had a close friend, because I was always so afraid of betrayal. So afraid that I would be cast out, and many times I was, when I just wanted to think. Now I don't know if there is much else than my own thoughts, and there is nothing for them to do but bounce around in my head. I hope for someone who can share my mind. Someone who can relate to life, looking back on it, reflecting, not just living it.          "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now I am thinking about the convocation I have in about 45 minutes. But I'll definitely need to leave in around thirty. that boy Michael was really cute. really cute. he is the first nice looking Mexican that I have seen yet. Ok maybe there were a few others but he lives on my floor and he introduced himself. that's one of the things I don't like about this school. no one introduces themselves to each other. it's like everyone only cares about their own lives and won't be bothered by anyone else's. but you know what. I think everyone else wants to meet people too, at least the majority but they just don't know how to go about doing it so they act like they don't care and disinterested or they act like they are much too busy and much too good for anyone else. it's very sad I think. at the beginning everyone is all excited, expecting other people to be really nice and friendly and then they meet the first bitchy person. Now they realize how things work around here and in an effort not to get thwarted and rejected by another person, they too take on the same attitude and on goes the downward spiral. just because we all fear a little bit of rejection. Sad really. that was my friend matt from economics class. He's not really my friend but I sit next to him in class. he seems nice enough and he is going to let me borrow his econ book since mine has not come in the mail yet. I'm going to be so behind in economics. I tell you. I really like that class though. so anyways. I know how this goes because I thought everyone would be nice and friendly but I was met with blank stares when I smiled at anyone anywhere on campus with the exception of a few. A very few. whatever. I am still going to smile and I am still going to introduce myself and be nice because otherwise I will be miserable and unapproachable like those people. ugh. I just put ""so anyways"" instead of ""so anyway"" I think that sounds as dumb as ""laters"" when one really means ""later"". that is really very jr. high. I miss those days. I wonder how Cindy is doing. ugh. I really don't want to go to the convocation because everyone is just going to be with their own little group and I will be an outcast once again. I'm pretty and nice and outgoing and popular and smart. Damn that sounds really conceited. Maybe I'm a little of that too. I considered erasing a couple of those adjectives but I think that's pretty dumb considering I really do think those things about myself. it's not socially acceptable to think good things about yourself. It's much more appealing to not know any of the good things about oneself. I confess that I too am attracted to ignorance of ones own worth and humility and modesty. But if you know it about yourself I think it is worse to act like you are modest and humble than to just admit it. Within reason that is. so anyway. I am these things but I feel like people don't want to reach out and meet new people and therefore I get shafted. I know they will like me if they get to know me but it's that introducing part that is really limiting. kind of stops the whole getting to know you thing prematurely. I am so proud of myself lately. I am being such a good girl. Although my habit of exercising everyday at 5 has been rudely interrupted with today's events of the five o'clock dinner at Trudy's which was pointless to attempt because I missed it anyway. I should have just gone to work out anyway and not let meetings and such get in the way of my schedule esp. when they are unimportant. I'm really irritated by that. but back to the story. I have been developing such good habits. I make my bed everyday, I wash my face twice a day, I get all my assignments down early or at least I begin them really early. O shit. I just got a little flash of procrastination. That sneaky devil. NO GO AWAY!!!. I'm not going to be a procrastinator this year. I just don't have the time for that. I run every day . Mon-thurs. 2 miles a day. plus I see a few cute boys in the gym that's always nice. kind of a motivating factor. when I get back from the convocation I'm going to go run otherwise my whole system will be screwed up. Damn that dinner. UGH. What else do I do. O yea. I didn't even go out last weekend and I had no desire too. I haven't been drinking. I haven't been too flakey. With the exception of ross but that's quite not my fault most of the time. Anyway we are good terms at the present. I'm being a pretty good daughter. I finished my scholarship applications stuff. what to write about now. I want to write about something cool. No luck. I really want to join the p2 chamber music group but I hope that they allow flutes. Bad flutes in lol. I'm probably really bad by now. I wonder if there is practice rooms around. I need to find one anyway to practice the piano anyway. I thought it would be a lot easier to get guys here. I thought they'd be all confident and just come up to you. And then I would act all shy and innocent. It's just how I act. Natural reflex to wanted attention. Sometimes I think I'm so stupid. And then they would flatter me and ask me out. And I would act like I wasn't really sure. I little bit suspicious of their motives. (and rightly so I imagine) and then I would say ok and give them my number and things would be lovely. well I have to go to the convocation that will steal hours of my life away. see yaw. This has been a pleasant venting experience I tell you. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I really need to study for chemistry, but I just remembered that this assignment was due. I  would have done it earlier, but my computer has been giving me so many problems. First  all these warnings about ""you have spyware and adware"" started coming up and then it started  working really slow--it took 15 minutes to open up the internet!!  Then after a while it wouldn't  even do that--it just sat there!  So I tried to shut it down and it still didn't do anything--but if I  tried to start a program, it said ""This program cannot open because the system is shutting  down. ""  So I unplugged it and let the battery run out. Computers are so stupid. But I guess we  couldn't live without them. I really hope I don't fail this chemistry test tomorrow. I'm really  nervous because it's my first real college test and it's also over some stuff that I don't  completely understand. My roommate is in the same class as me, but she's at the PCL--she  calls it her home because she's there every minute of every day--I don't know how she does it!!  Studying for 10 minutes makes me feel like I need a break--she stays there for hours!!  She's  really sweet though. I so happy I got good roommates (yes--that's plural--I have 3  roommates--I'm in supplemental housing--it's not as bad as I thought it would be)  2 of my  roommates are really nice. The other one is kind of weird, but she's hardly ever here--she's  always at her boyfriend's house. That's kind of rude to her parents though--I mean--they're  paying for her food and housing and she's not even sleeping here. The only thing I know about  her is her name really. That's okay though--at least she's not using my computer all the time  anymore. When we first moved in she didn't have a Ethernet cord so I said she could do her  add/drops on my pc. But then she printed off all her lecture notes for her classes (on MY  printer--with MY ink) so at least that's not happening any more. Andy Roddick lost in the quarterfinals of the US Open tonight. That made me so sad--I LOVE  Andy Roddick--he has to be the sexiest guy ever!  I met him last year and the Tennis Masters  Series in Houston and he signed my shirt--me and 3 of my friends had made shirts that spelled  out ANDY--he and his coach really liked them!!  But I really wanted him to win--he won the  Open last year and that was his first so I really wanted him to defend it. Oh well. The guy he  lost to was playing really good. He played the same type of game as Andy though. They were  calling him a Swedish Andy Roddick, but he'll never be Andy Roddick--he wasn't cute enough. Chemistry and biology are going to kick my butt this semester. I'm not really sure if I want to  major in biology any more. I think it might just be too much science for me. I thought I could  handle it, but I just don't know anymore. I know majoring in biology will probably help me  make a good score on the MCAT, though. I really want to get into med school. I want to be a  pediatrician. It's just so much school though. OY!  But I think it'll pay off. I really want to do  something with kids and I could do that and make money at the same time. I mean--it's that or  teaching right?  and teaching is definitely NOT on my list of things I want to do. My mom is a  teacher and they don't get paid half of what they deserve!  She works all the time--sometimes  she doesn't come home until after midnight--and she only works with 5th and 6th graders. I  mean--it's probably worse with older kids right?  I don't know--I just couldn't handle it--I'd  feel like I deserved more. Chemistry time. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm glad I'm doing this assignment right now, I can't wait until Friday so I can get hammered That's the guy that was eying me like I was going to steal something it's kind of hot outside I wonder if I should change before we go to Bennigins tonight. Did I spell Bennigan's right?  I hope I did the second time. Young Buck is a good lyricist. It's too bad he doesn't get that much shine.

Tell me about yourself.,"Hi, I'm sitting here in the computer lab at the FAC, and it is dark outside and I'm a young attractive female. . I'll definitely need an escort when it's time to go home. Home, that's what I call my dorm these days. it's just easier for me. I want to have some established place to live and stuff that way I'll be more plugged in to the university lifestyle. I used to laugh at LT when she called her dorm home. I guess I am following in her footsteps. although her strides are quite different from mine. and talking of strides, I miss cross country and all the guys. it was so much fun. I enjoyed every moment of it without even knowing it. I wish I could rewind back to those days when everything was so nice, so quarantined and all the laws of nature followed as they should. what went up came down and so on. I wish I could just see the fruit of my hard work as I did in cross country. the family atmosphere that I ridiculed and even took for granted at times. how could I have been so? I who loves others, I who cherishes all my friends. they were all my friends, all 23 of them. some more than others, but we all had that common goal that I find characterizes friendships. we were a sister hood. gosh, what a mourner I am, lamenting over the past. but they were good times. I'm sure, and I hope to God that I'll have some more good times or even better than ever times still to come. but this I can only hope that God gives me. For who knows tomorrow may never be. perhaps this is all I have. I'm not afraid though, just not prepared to meet my maker yet. I don't think I've done what I was purposed to do. therefore I'm not ready to go yet. in fact,,, I don't even know what it is that I was purposed to do. perhaps it is not a single great thing, perhaps it is just all those little things that I should be doing that I was purposed to do. who knows?  who cares but me and my maker?  Anyway, I guess that's life, not figuring out what one was purposed to do but just doing it. I guess it just comes naturally as all things in life do. I don't think planning is such a great idea. I don't think MLK planned to lead the civil rights movement when he was a freshman in college. I guess the civil rights found him and appointed him leader. or so I guess. and whatever it is that I'll need to do will find me and use me for what I am worth. when put that way, it sounds almost prostitution. but it cannot be. mankind is not a prostitute race. or is it. I don't know. sometimes I think it is . other times I think it is a dignified race. but then again to think mankind a dignified race is to give it too much adoration. too much more than it deserves. Mankind is a fallen race. lower than the angles -which we should have been higher than. but then again mankind is a dignified race made in the image of God with the ability to tap into the supernatural/the unknown unlike any other creature. There is no intelligent life in other planets, we are it. Now, I don't mean to say there is no other life forms out there, but that it is not more intelligent or even as intelligent as mankind. but then again what do I know? I who was born only 18 years ago?  I don't know much, but then again, I have know a lot more than I credit myself. I have the ability to tap into the fountain of knowledge that never runs dry. there are things, great mysteries, that I knew even before I was born. but how is this?. oops my 20 minutes are up and that popup really disrupted my stream of consciousness!!!!  what an ass! "
Tell me about yourself.,"There's a picture of the two of us up on my bulletin board. It's right behind my computer where I can see it when I'm working. I look at that picture and remember my past. I remember a time when I thought that things were different than they really are. I don't think anymore that it was anyone's fault, either hers or mine, that is. I respected her so much though, and it hurts to be let down by someone you think so highly of. In the picture, I look so innocent and young, in my white cheerleading skirt, and the royal blue shell with Eagles written across it. Her arm is around my shoulder, and she's holding her sunglasses in her hand. I recall that she had just taken them off before we took the picture. There are people in the background behind us, and the gym is visible. I remember how beautiful the day was; it was so crisp and blue and wonderful. It's hard to tell, and I've wondered many times, what exactly she was thinking when we took that picture together. When I look at the face, the eyes especially, sometimes I see something warm and trustworthy. Other times I'm sure I see something sinister and strange. I don't know why I still struggle with this issue so much. I've never really gotten over it. I went into this assignment knowing that I wanted to write about Carla because in class, I heard something said about how writing about something can change your opinion or the way you look at something. Well, it is true that I'm noticing things about the picture, minute details, that I didn't pay too much attention to before. But her face and her eyes are still an enigma to me. I can't explain in words how much I want her to care about me, to love me, and to think I'm something special. I want to tell her everything that I've done today and yesterday and since I arrived here. But she's back home, and I'm here, and there's something ominous to me about writing her an email. I don't know why. I miss her so much. She was there when I really needed someone. I see now more and more, that this was mostly situational. It's not like she planned to be in that room when my whole world fell apart. But she was. And she told me how to get through it, and she cared. More than any person has ever cared about me on this earth, at least that I'm aware of. The picture is truly beautiful, even though it's more than 5 years old. The light is in our hair, coming from behind, and our faces are bright and illuminated. The beauty of the day is apparent. I just feel like something needs to happen between us. There was never any closure for me, or continuation. Our relationship just sort of drifted off and never returned, and now I don't know where we are. I saw her by chance before I left for college at church because we are making a new church pictorial, and her family happened to be getting their pictures done on the same night as our family. I was very surprised to see her, and I know my heart skipped a beat. I hadn't seen her in such a long time. probably since before school let out for the summer. The truth is, I was a little bit upset with her for not being around. But she was nothing but warm and kind to me. I don't know why she always does that. I see her, and it's like I'm the whole world. But then when we're apart, I don't hear a peep. I don't understand our relationship sometimes, and it's very hurtful to me to analyze her possible motives. Anyway, she hugged me, and touched me, and stood close to me, and made me promise to keep in touch when I'm gone. She even promised to make me some chili or something when I come back and come over to her house. I fear that that's an empty promise, like so many of the others. But at the time, it was easy to believe her. I really think it's something to do with her eyes. You have never seen anyone with such power behind their gaze. She is so earnest with her eyes, but so untruthful with her actions. It confuses me to no end. I don't even know why I brought the picture with me, or why I decided to place it in such an obvious place where I can always see it. But I did. I guess my hopes die hard. I still hope that maybe she really does care about me. Maybe she really does think I'm special. Maybe, she does even really love me. I don't know what to believe. I think maybe this evening when I have some time to myself, I'll write her that email that I've been meaning to. I think maybe I could even get up the courage to be totally honest with her, and get everything out in the open. Well, maybe that's a little too unrealistic, but maybe I can begin to open it up for discussion. I think it would be very good for me to do so. I want to know what's really behind those eyes. I've got to know about the truth. I really desire to understand the enigma. My dear Carla.       "
Tell me about yourself.,"Here I sit wondering just what to write that involves my stream of consciousness, which shouldn't be too hard. Writing for me is usually pretty easy, however this assignment seems to be particularly hard. Maybe because I feel partially tired and torn down from my long day. I am looking forward to tomorrow because Thursdays are probably my easiest days because I will not have to wake up at the usual 9am and oh yeah it is also one day closer to the weekend!  Although I have to say that 9am is also a lot better than 8am, which was time I had to arrive at school during my high school days. Since high school just popped into my mind, I have to say that college is a major leap from high school. Despite the fact that it is more enjoyable it also is a lot more stressful. For instance, leaving your family, friends, and so forth behind. Not to mention your adolescence. I am happy to say that the transition for me has ran pretty smoothly although the major bumps are yet to come. One of my ""bumps"" that I am experiencing is the massive amount of reading involved, at one point I enjoyed reading but maybe that is because the reading is not usually my preferred choice. Another obstacle is that it it is your choice whether to read or not, in fact it is just another realization that I am out in the real world and everything is based upon my choices. I find that very scary, yet also very exciting in a positive way because I can make my future what I want it to be.  "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am sitting in my room watching the sandlot. Alessandra, my roommate is here too. She's getting ready to go home for the weekend. Shelley and Liz are both going home to. They offered me a ride, but I'm not going to go because I went home last weekend, and I don't want to go home two weekends in a row. Although I would really like to see Jordan, my boyfriend. He's at work right now and I'm waiting for him to call. The sandlot is on the part where Benny decides to jump the fence and get the baseball back from the neighbors yard. I've seen this movie a thousand times, the next thing to happen will be the dog chasing all the boys all around the town. This is probably one of my favorite baseball movies. My favorite of all time is definitely Field of Dreams. I always cry in the end where Kevin Costner's character plays catch with his dad. They didn't get along when he was younger and he never got to say that he was sorry for everything before he died. My dad and I have been getting along a lot more lately than we have been, I know that I would regret it if I just gave up on us getting along and said fuck it, so I'm glad we are at least trying to work things out. He apologized to Jordan this weekend for all the things he said to him this summer. Jordan came over and they had a talk on the back porch. I stayed inside and folded laundry because I felt awkward and tense about the whole thing. But apparently it went alright. I need to talk to my dad and tell him that I appreciate him doing that. I forgot to before. Actually, I just realized now that that's something I need to do. Probably should have said it earlier. I hope I didn't hurt his feelings. Oh well, like I said, I felt awkward about the whole thing in general. Which reminds me of a funny awkward moment I had today. I was at the Union with Shelley, and I went to the bathroom. Another girl was going in just as I was, and this made my shy bladder act up. She went into one stall, I went into the other, and I just couldn't go. Well, she wasn't going either, apparently, so we both just sat there for about a minute. I was trying hard to relax and finally I peed a little, but then it stopped. So the girl pees a little, and I pee a little more, but I still can't go all the way. I guess she gave up, because I heard the toilet flush and she left, so I was finally able to go. I went back to Shelley and told her the story. We were cracking up in the quietness of the Union 3rd floor. We started talking about Alex's engagement (again), which I feel guilty about because I am usually not the type to gossip, but it's hard to avoid talking about it. Before I saw Alex's ring (which is her grandmothers, Joe did not buy it), Shelley told me that it was 1. 7 carats, which is pretty impressive, but then I saw it, and looked at it closely, and it's not that great. Its color isn't that good, and it has a gigantic flaw in the side which I suppose Alex either hasn't seen or is just pretending that she can't see it. Jordan just called and I told him I need to call him back in eight minutes. Anyway, Alex is being really unrealistic about the whole engagement, wedding thing. She wants to get all these diamonds and a new setting for her ring, and she's looking at dresses that are 30,000 dollar, designer dresses, and the whole thing is just like a little girl planning some fantasy wedding. She doesn't seem to realize that the average middle class family can't afford something like that. But who knows, maybe her parents have more money than I think. Also, I don't know how seriously her parents have been taken her engagement. She's only been with Joe for about two months. I can hardly think about my future with Jordan now, and I definitely couldn't have thought about it after two months. The only thing I can say is that if we're still together when I graduate, I'll probably marry him. But I find myself thinking a lot that I want to be single, and I want to do all these things like travel and study aboard and maybe live in New York, and if someone is going to hold me back from those things, then I have to wonder if that's the person from me. I love him so much, but I also feel like I might be holding on to him because he's my first love and all that. He's such a great person though, I hope no matter what happens, that he will always be in my life. I just don't want to break his heart, or have my heart broken. I hope when it stops working, it just stops working for both of us and we can still be friends. Well, I have ten seconds left, so I think I'm going to call him now.   "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am sitting in my room and I look around to see my roommate and my boyfriend. Trying to make my train of thought come to me so I can type it. All I can think about is all my boyfriend's theories about life and his many different issues. He believes in ""Boxism"", he was a little out of it when he thought of this, were everyone was born in a box which was placed in a bigger box, hospital room, which is part of a bigger box, the hospital hall, which is placed into a bigger box, the whole hospital building itself. Then he goes on to state that we are then taken home and put in a box, the crib, which is in a box the room, part of the bigger box the whole house. After this we go to school and the classroom becomes our box after we graduate we our placed in our dorm room box and walk from class to class or box to box. After we finally manage to get a job our cubicle or office which then becomes our box. Then he goes on that when we die they dig a box and put you into a box. My boyfriend's theory always brings a smile to my face as I remember when he first told me this. Wow, that only took me ten minutes. I look around my room and see all my pictures and think about going back to high school, I believe that those are some of the best times in my life. My class was very small and we all got to know each other very well. I have always been told that college is the best time of you life but it will take a lot to compete with high school. I hope it becomes the best time of my life. I have already come to enjoy it and have become adapted to college life. I love being able to do whatever I want when I want to. I hope these next few years will become the best years of my life.  "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm tired, I just cleaned our apartment and now I'm tired. But I feel satisfied that I cleaned the whole place. My roommate is extremely messy and is hard to live with at times but I've known her for 15 years and I love her to death. Now my mind is being tracked to when we met at the baseball field when pur older brothers were at practice. Evan, my brother is now is Africa and I miss him a lot I think it hits me in waves. I wonder what it's like there, hot and rainy I suppose but I wonder if he misses us as much as we miss him. I think he probably does he just doesn't hank about it as much as we do. My boyfriend lives in College Station and I miss him too. It feels silly at times though to have this person you love and car about so much to have them so far form you let you still can keep close. Technology is incredible. I'm able to talk to Evan once a month. He's in Africa for goodness sake that's an ocean away. I talk to Michael every day usually more then once. Now I'm getting hot, and I'm so thank ful the ac just flipped on. I find it hard to believe people were ever comfortable without the air conditioning. This summer at the camp I worked at we didn't have an ac in the cabin and I got used to it. I fact I would get cold when I was in the ac. But still the comfort of it is much better than without. I miss camp I miss my campers. It's the one place that I really feel at home way from home, I am so confident there. not that I'm not here I just have been there for ten years and have grown up there. All my best friends are there. Of course I have other good friends but there just f=something about living with someone for three months that gives you a new look at them . They learn your morning routine and you there's it  comfort thing because someone else knows you so well that they know how you wake very morning. I miss those guys. And it's not like I can't call them or even hang out with some but I don't. Isn't that strange that I love these people so much yet I don't call and hang out either them. Yes they call me and sometimes I don' t call them back because I'm nervous. Why?  I don't understand my strange want to be with people but my stronger want to be alone and watch TV and just do nothing. I need to start working out again, I t has been so long since I have I think I would have more of a desire to get up and go if I had more of a pep ""I just worked out"" kind of look on life. I really love Lance Armstrong. He had inspired so man people to get in shape and be healthy and support the fight against cancer that you just have to respect that. I also respect him because he had the same cancer my daddy beat. That was an awful time in my life. Freshman year found out that my dad has cancer. He's fine now but wow that scared me he wouldn't be here for so many things that he has seen it's incredible. Medicine is absolutely incredible. It makes me appreciate everything he does a lot more. Funny how even when he was going through all that awful stuff I was pretty unaware. My parents kinds kept us in the dark. Not like I asked but we just didn't talk about it. I feel like I really don't know what happen to him during those months except that he got better and now he's doing great. I wonder if he still thinks about it everyday or if he's let that terrible memory flee from his mind. Wow he is one funny man, he can say anything and I'll laugh but I guess that's how it should be. He should be my hero. I wish every girl had a daddy like mine I think the world would be a make more relaxed kin of place. He always makes every tense situation funny and more laid back. My mom is the opposite and I wonder how hey have been together for 29 years when they are so opposite . But I know she loves him and I think he loves her. He does he just doesn't always shoe it in front of us but I'm sure he does to her. He'll do really sweet stuff like on Valentines Day. I think she just needs to relaxes a bit and realize that not every situation needs to blown out of proportion. Wow that was really neat. "
Tell me about yourself.,"go back back back to the disaster . I can't get that song out of my head. It was so weird on Courtney's board I couldn't understands what it meant till I read it out loud I wonder if spelling counts on this and if you can go back and correct mis spelled words  like they care. I am so bored but so excite about the job I have essentially been doing the same thing for the past three years and I think that I can handle the work load but this is college and its suppose TO BE HARDER BUT SO FAR IT HASN'T BEEN I STILL NEED TO read some of the info in the art history book that girl pre adviser said it would be fun but so far it has been a snooze feast. what else to write about I though that I would have bad dreams after watching train spotting with the dead baby in the cradle but I really having been dreaming much probably because I stay up half the night hanging out with the hall everybody seems pretty nice and all the guy are hot especially matt oh baby but I think that he likes Courtney everybody likes Courtney she has that Chicago accent and she pretty and nice I couldn't even get drunk guys to dance with me on Saturday the only guy I danced with was p and then when Steve said sorry to interrupt while we were dancing he said there was nothing to interrupt what a jerky think to say I mean I was standing right there it wasn't like he was drunk and didn't know what he was saying pritvi is funny but quite the little gossiper I really like my floor when they offer me a spot out side of supplemental housing I probably won't take I because I know so many people here and hopeful we can become good friends I haven't had any real friends for the past few years I been so involved in school but the weekends were so boring with out a school activity to do I seen a movie with a group of kids  twice one was after a school event and the other was after a church h think. I saw movies that I didn't want to see and it was pretty much like any other movie I've seen by myself but I remember them better I only have ten more minutes left I like to count I'm always counting things like yesterday I counted lance Armstrong bracelets 9 on the way to the theater building and seven on the was back Courtney's doesn't count could I didn't see it on the walk I am so bored right now but I am going to be so busy with soccer, broccoli project, circle k, and hopefully crew or rowing which sound the same to me but apparently with rowing you only have one ore and with crew you have two I don't know what else to right where is Chris I so think that he forgot to knock on my door and just went off to lunch with Courtney. I can't believe he slept with jo I mean they had just met and a hour ago she had been kissing Steven I mean if I was Steven I would have been pissed what if all my thought were filled with profanity since I don't cuss I just thought about it constantly but I think cussing is stupid and you have to be a certain type of person to say certain words I sound so stupid when I cuss  "
Tell me about yourself.,"man I should have waited and gone to the restroom before I walked into the library's computer lab. . Geez!!!!!!!!!. . I really need to go but I can't because I have already began to write. . Well now I know that I must hold it and wait for these 20 minutes to past. Which could feel like forever. Wow! looking around I see a lot of students working on something that must be important since they sit quietly stuck to the seat in front of their computer. . Finally. Today was the first day in which I ate with some friends from high school. . Whom right now seem to be my only friends  here at UT if I am lucky to see them around in between classes. I know I should try and make new friends because you know what they say, ""you meet your best and closest friends in college. "" I have made attempts to talk to new people on campus, whether I'm sitting on the bus with someone I have never met or waiting in the hallway with another student for my next class to begin. I mean I want to meet many new faces but then again I am worried that the people I approach don't want to be approached by a complete stranger. I don't know but I need to figure something out so I can enjoy every little bit of my college experience. hey? wasn't there suppose to be a timer at the top of the screen? oh no I didn't bother checking what time I started to type!well it doesn't seem like 20 minutes just yet so ill keep typing about something. Well, lately I have been having doubts about whether to change my major or not. I am currently    a mechanical engineer major but have been thinking about switching to computer science. I feel like I will have an easier time in computer science because I find it more interesting. GEEZ!!!!! my arm is staring to hurt from all this typing and my fingers are all worn out. I knew I should have taken that keyboarding class in middle school so I would learn to type properly and not with the same index fingers. lately my mind has been full of worries and things that I need to do before deadlines. this morning I went to the Austin Municipal Court to turn in my Defensive driving certificate and they didn't accept it because I need to pay off the balance of my citation first. Now where am I going to get $137 right now? My books left me with an empty wallet and I have at least 2 weeks to come up with that money. I think I'm just going to have to sell some of my valued belongings and maybe even donate plasma again. Yup! I have donated blood before and have received money for it and I told myself it would be my first and last time to do it. but it doesn't seem like its going to be that way! so I think its been 20 minutes now because I only had 45 minutes of log on time and I was just informed that I have 25 minutes left so yeah. . "
Tell me about yourself.,"I got home from Burnet today from hunting and it wasn't that great. The dove weren't flying when I was there maybe its because I'm bad luck. Sometimes I think stupid things like that, like maybe for instance people were catching fish before I got there then when I got there I didn't catch anything and neither did anybody else. Super smells really good right now I think mom is cooking mashed potatoes and ribs. Sounds really good because I'm so hungry I haven't eaten all day. Speaking of not eating all day I just realized how fun my weekend was. That's why I haven't really eaten that much. Food sounds so good. Friday night I went out to a few parties and tried to get into frat parties but they're all gay and wont let any dudes in. Even though it was me with a bunch of girls they still wouldn't let me in. I'm pissed. From now on when I have a party I'm not letting any frat people in just hot sorority girls. Some of my friends are in sororities they seem cool. Anyway, then I went to the UT game on Saturday and we stomped all over North Texas. I kind of felt bad but not really. Its weird to be at a UT game and say ""this is my school. ""  I'm so used to being in high school and going to high school games I'm not used to seeing 80000 people at a game for my school. I wish school didn't involve class. I love the college atmosphere but not the class part. Maybe my psychology professor will give me an A. That would be great of him. He's a cool guy though I like his class. All my other professors are boring but he knows how to have fun while he lectures. I'm glad I got out of my calculus class and in a different one because professor radin is not cool at all. he needs to learn how to be not so uptight. My new calculus professor is cool though he's more laid back and knows how to teach things and give examples. Gosh I'm hungry I wish dinner were ready already. Taco Cabana is really good late at night I just realized that. I'm glad it's open 24 hrs because where would I go eat at 3 a. M?  Speaking of Taco Cabana San Antonio was fun I just wish we went to Cowboys and danced a little. San Antonio was cool but not as cool as burnet I want to hurry up and go hunting again. maybe this weekend I'll go back and shoot some more birds. Girls make me so mad. Why does a certain somebody have to be stupid all the time?  She bitches too much at me for little things. I should just not talk to her anymore. I don't know why I can't just not talk to her. All girls are the same to me, they all bitch about stupid things and get mad at you for saying hi to other girls that are your friends but they go off and say hi to their guy friends and expect us not to get mad at them. It's dumb. Jenna is dumb too. She should have ditched her boyfriend to hang out with her quote best friend Kelly on her birthday. She is stupid for choosing someone she just barely met over her best friend. Kelly doesn't deserve to cry I should yell at Jenna for that. Jessica is a cool girl she cares about me and doesn't want anything to happen to me I should hang out with her more. Stony Point football will always suck. They lose too much. New coaches are cool though I wish he was there when I was there. I need to do chemistry homework. He needs to stop mumbling and getting off topic to. My TA pisses me off so much I think I'm smarter than her. All the answers I had were right and the ones she gave me were wrong I can't believe that. 66 on the first hw is crap. there goes my confidence. She's a good looking girl though I'll give her that much but she can't help for crap. hopefully by this weekend I'll have my work done so I can hunt. I really can't stop thinking about hunting. I want to shoot me a deer I've never shot one before. Season opens soon I think so dove will have to do for now.        "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am sitting here thinking about what I am going to eat . I am very hungry. for lunch i had a sala, some pasta and some soup, oh that guy was really hot . when I work out today those guys are going to be really hot too. oh god something stinks. i wonder what it is . I hope its not the person sitting next tome. what is that girl wearing she looks very tacky. when I go to my dorm later I am going to fall out. First I have to call my parents or they will get mad . this is a library why are people walking around and talking so much. I wonder why my roommate does the stuff she does, and why is this person talking so what is wrong with his hear okay it is really starting to stink. oh crap I'm supposed to meet my roommate for lunch but oh well it doesn't matter, this is much more important. Last night the MTV music wards were so crazy, there were a lot of crazy things happening everywhere, I thought I was going to flip. I absolutely loved what Beyonce and Alicia Keys were wearing. I wonder when will Destiny's child get back together hopefully soon. Man I hope I did good on my Spanish quiz it was fairly easy I think. What classes do I have tomorrow hopefully easy ones because I can't stand some of my classes. i wonder what my roommate is doing right now. I wonder if my exboyfriend has a girlfriend right now. man when will this be over 20 minutes is a long time to just write about anything. ooh another hot boy oh and there is his girlfriend. That's okay I look better than her anyways. I wonder what my friends are doing in El Paso maybe I'll give them  a call when I have time. I'm so excited the first football game is this week what am i going to wear who am I going to go with Hopefully we will beat north Texas. oh my god games mean after parties and after parties mean really hot football players too bad I'm only 17 I can probably still get into some clubs. the ones that allow babies. Man it seems like I have been on here for years when is this crap going to end. wow my stomach just growled really loud, hopefully no one heard me but if they did ohg well I know they are probably having the same problem. I wonder what my brother is doing I wonder if he quit the football team yet I told him he should just do track but he didn't believe me so that is his fault, but he'll learn they always do. I wonder did my mom send my money for my ATM because I know I could still use it Oh crap the time is almost up I thought my brain would explode "

Tell me about yourself.,"I can't believe that I missed my first class this morning. I don't know what happened. Maybe my roommate turned off my alarm early and didn't tell me. But I don't think so, because he's a good guy and he wouldn't do that. I hope there wasn't a quiz in kinesiology today. That would just be my luck. The one time I miss it, there was a quiz. Man this sucks not having books, I'm getting so far behind in all my classes reading. It's going to be hard to catch up. There are some many people in all my classes it's ridiculous. You know what else is ridiculous, not having books. Why can't I get into shape faster?  I know it takes time, but I've been running for 3 weeks and I don't see  much of an improvement. If I am going to walk on the cross country team here I need to be faster than I was in high school. My old high school team mates are not doing so hot right now. The top runners are running about one minute and a half behind what we were running last year. I was running 16:26 for a 5K, but these guys are running like 17:40 for a 5K. They are going to have a lot of time to make up if they are going to be competitive in one of the toughest districts in the state, second to only the woodlands district. God, I hate the woodlands, and cedar park, and Georgetown. I wish I hadn't injured myself during track season, cause I had to take 3 months off the heal. And three months with no running killed me. I gained like 20 pounds during the summer session here at UT. But summer school was so much fun. I met lots of cool guys like Kevin, rahim, and Justin. And a lot of girls. Actually too many girls to count, but out of all those girls, I don't think any of them found me attractive at all. And when ever some girl approaches me at a party, some one will swoop in take her. Some one like Kevin or rahim. I'm still mad for what Kevin did. I can't believe that he ""made out"" with my best friend and the girl that I love so much. That just sucked. I felt like some one had ripped out my heart and then run it over with several big rigs, then dropped it off a high building, then feed it to piranhas in the Amazon rain forest. But I know Kevin didn't do that one purpose, or did he?  But I had a long talk with both Heather and Kevin, and we're cool. Oh and Heather is coming to visit this weekend!  I am so excited! I haven't seen her since before school started like 4 weeks ago. I'm disappointed because she was supposed to come to UT but she didn't get into articture school so she had to go to atm, but she is going to transfer her in a year. I hope. I have to plan a fun weekend with stuff for us to do, so she and I can have a good time again. But what do I do?  I have to work part of sat and sun, but we still can have fun Friday and then after I get off work. I just want her to be happy, if its not with me then so be it. But I will marry her, I will marry her, because I love her so much and she is my best friend. I hope she feels the same way. I don't know what to do, cause I don't want to mess up our perfect friendship, oh well. We will have to see what unfolds. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Today was a pretty calm day. Nothing outrageous happened. Right now I feel hungry, probably because the last time I ate was at 6:50 or so and I didn't have much. I tired this new stir fry stuff and some mashed potatoes. It was ok but I guess it was only filling for the time being. I almost forgot I had this assignment due tomorrow. I sprang out of bed as soon as I remembered. earlier my suite mates and I watched a movie at the union called Mean Girls. It was good and they showed it for free too so there were a lot of people there. They show a lot of movies at the union. The next dorm family event planned for us is to go and watch the movie Troy. My roommate's friend is going to make her and I watch the movie schindler's list sometime soon. He is a big movie fan and is going into the college of communication and he wants to be a director later on. He has already made a movie. He made it in high school and he went around and just videotaped the different events and people at school. My roommate said it was good. She just told me that her chemistry professor wrote the book they use in class. Its not just him but he has contributed to writing the book. He has his name on the cover of the book and everything. I'm going home to Houston next weekend to see my family and to attend this bayou bhangra competition that all my friends are going to. Its going to be really fun. I can't wait to see my baby sister she's just too cute for me. I love her and she's a miracle baby too especially because she serviced through my mom's accident and all the medication my mom had to take during her pregnancy. But I guess that's God's love and blessing and I am very thankful for everything he as done for me and my family but I don't know what to think of him after my aunt and uncle's freak accident and death. I don't understand why he sends us these extraordinary people and then just takes them away from us before its time for them to go. I don't know I suppose its just one of those things that happen and can't be explained. And I believe that things happen for a reason but I don't know how God can justify their death and all these things that have been happening to our entire family. Things haven't seem to be right ever since my grandmother passed away. Well that's all I can think of to write about and its time now too, how convenient. Bye "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am sitting here in my dorm room trying to organize my time for the rest of the day and night. I have a lot of reading to catch up on. I have trouble sitting down reading for a long period of time. I would rather sit in a lecture and listen to a professor. That is, if he/she is interesting. I want to read and understand my psychology book, but for some reason I haven't been able to concentrate on it. I feel like I am behind in this class for some reason. My mom graduated with a degree in psychology. She loved it. My biology class is my favorite. My professor is interesting and the book is interesting to me too. I wish I knew what I wanted to be. I have so many different ideas and I can't decide right now. I talked to my mom today and she suggested marine biology because she knew I used to be interested in that. She also suggested being a doctor. I don't know if I can go to school for 8 more years though. Four more years seems like a lot to me. But I know I will do it. I just feel weird right now I guess because I am just starting. I am 3 and a half hours away from home. I like it here but I miss it there. I always have a lot on my mind and I think that is why it has been hard to concentrate on reading lately. Eight months ago, 2 days before Christmas, my boyfriend of 3 years, Phillip, was killed in a car accident. I almost didn't come to UT because he was supposed to follow me here and live in Austin too so we could be together. I thought about that a lot the first week I was here. It is just really hard. This is one of the reasons I am being in my reading for philosophy and psychology. I've been doing homework all week making up for last week. When it comes to school work I love being ahead. Which is why I am doing this writing assignment a week in advance. I'm hoping that I will feel better when I finish this and I will be able to read 2 chapters and comprehend it. When I stay ahead in school I always feel so much better. I like to read the sections before lectures rather than after. I am the type of person that takes on big load and I tend to get stressed out easy that way. I decided that when I came here I was strictly going to concentrate on school. In high school I had a full schedule of ap classes, a job, and participated in athletics. I loved all of it but I decided I need a break from every thing else which is why I'm not working this semester. I worked 6 days a week this past summer to save up for spending money this year so that I would not have to worry about working. My parents are paying for my school and all my bills, even my gas so I don't ever want to ask them for spending money. I received some scholarship money from Dobie, UT from my home town. We have community scholarship that they give out every year. There was a scholarship made in Phillips name this year. I got that one. That made me feel good I guess. I like being here but it is just really weird. I hope I adjust to Austin soon. I already like it a lot better than when I first move here 2 weeks ago. My best friend Stephanie helped me move down here and it was hard when she had to go back home, but I am going to see here this weekend so that makes me happy "
Tell me about yourself.,"I feel that I have so much to do in the next few days. College is so overrated. The few actual moments that you do have to go out and party and have a good time, or do whatever it is that you like doing, equal all the other times you are reading, reading, studying, or doing other school stuff. I had a French vanilla cappuccino at like 9:30 tonight and it gave me so much energy that I can't sit and focus on one thing. It seems that I have been procrastinating all night. Oooh all that I need is you (so the song I am listening to right now) but anyways. now I don't remember what I was thinking about a moment ago. It must be that caffeine I'm not really used to but have consumed so much of it in the last 48 hours. O no. I'm not really sure what I just did. I hit tab because that's what you do to indent but it hit the finish button instead. So instead of having a stream of conscious thought for 20 minutes I think it was more like 2 so now I'm thinking about how I need to get in contact with the TA or the professor and explain how I will probably have two submissions but I'm not really sure because I don't know how computers work. They are so complex. I don't really understand them. Like earlier I couldn't log into the prescreening experimental stuff. I have put off the computer oriented stuff to later because in a way it scares me because I don't really trust them. I'm very skeptical of them. I feel like if I start something the computer has a mind of its own and is going to do whatever with it. Like just now, I'm panicking because the stupid machine is making an awful whirling twirling noise. The song I'm listening to is sung by a different group, but the same song I did a trio to two years ago and it is bringing back memories of practicing and performing. During a heavy practice time I had mono I remember. Kind of a cool time because I got to miss almost two weeks of school but the makeup work wasn't fun but I did get to know my teachers well that year. I wonder how the other two girls that I did the trio with are doing. They are both a year older than me so they've been doing this whole college thing longer. Speaking of long I just looked at the time and I've only been doing this for like five minutes. Looking at the clock and counting down the time reminds me of times during drill team practice after school when they seemed to drag on forever I made it a goal to not look at the clock so hopefully the time would pass by faster but of course it didn't. I actually saw a girl from my drill team this weekend. She is a choreographer for a dance team I was interested in trying out for, but I decided not too because it brought back to many memories. I am thinking about trying out for Steel Dance this weekend but I don't know yet. O yaw that reminds me that I need to email one of the girls on the team and ask her what the dress code for the clinic is because I really don't want to wear pink tights and a black leotard. It makes me feel fat. Which reminds me I never ate dinner tonight and its like 110. I guess all the Julius chips and salsa I ate will have to do. Thank goodness for Julio. He makes some awesome chips. I wonder who Julio is. Or even if Julio is still alive. My roommate brought his chips back from Del Rio. My Hippo something we learned about in class today must be working hard because it is bringing back many memories. I think ill remember the name of it well or not the name more the function of it because my boyfriend has a horrible memory and we always joke about being big like hippos and stuff so I definitely will remember that one. O look more remember things. I guess the hippo thing is working right now. The song I'm listening to reminds me of two girls on my drill team. Rachel and Shea. They were awesome dancers. I wonder where they are now. There is a girl in my architecture design class that reminds me of shea the way she looks and talks. Actually Shea has a pair of my comfy pants that I loved that my friend Brittney had on tonight. Shea is in Utah so I don't think I will ever see them again. Speaking of comfy clothes I wonder why all I wear to class now are soffe shorts and a t-shirt. It must be that whole college thing. O no. Here goes again. That whirling noise and now my instant messenger signed on when I didn't even click on the program. This computer is so random. Maybe I just need to update the AIM program. but then again I don't know that much about computers so I'm not really sure how I'd go about doing that. With my luck I'd probably download some computer virus with it too. And viruses. That thing about getting sick when you are most stressed. I will probably be getting sick soon because I am feeling very stressed right now although a huge weight was lifted off my shoulder today when we turned in a major project. Which didn't go exactly how I hoped but its over so I don't want to think about it. If I say I am going to get sick will my body start thinking that and make itself sick? That is something else we learned about. If you start thinking one thing you can convince yourself of it. O man I don't remember the name of it. I am really going to have to study for this test. I should probably start this weekend. Well there is one more thing to add to my to do list. I started one earlier and it just keeps getting longer. I need to add that I need to talk to a TA for this class and then email that girl from steel dance before I forget. My 20 minutes is up now its a good thing I ended with that to do list so maybe since it is the most recent thing I will remember. Now I really like this song. Its from 13 going on 30 that movie. I have started watching more movies since I got to college I think that is what I will ask for for my birthday-movies. O yaw my time is up. I need to get ready for bed so maybe I will get a decent amount of sleep tonight. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I just got back from the University Democrats meeting. It was really fun and informative. Lloyd Doggett was the guest speaker. He was very eloquent and well-versed, and he did an excellent job stating what he stood for and how the current gerrymandering is unfair, but we're not going to let it stop the party from victory. I hope to get really involved with it. It seems like a great way to get to know people and learn a lot about the political system at the same time. Other than University Democrat, I'm going to try to join UBC, Undergraduate Business Council. You have to fill out an application to become an At-Large member. The questions appeal to the creative side in applicant, so I hope that my creativity steps up to the plate. I think that UBC would also be a great way to meet people, especially since it's for students in the Business school. I also want to join Student Government. I think that some of the causes that they fight for are so worthwhile, like trying to extend the hours of the library. Student Council in High School didn't really accomplish that much, but I think that Student Government actually gets things done here. I'm listening to the Shins right now, they're a really good band. I love the melodies and guitar. Other bands that I like include Bright Eyes, Death Cab for Cutie, The Sounds, Belle and Sebastian, The Strokes, and so much more. Basically anyone on Saddle Creek records tends to be really good because they all sound so different. I haven't really been able to find out about new music lately though because I've been sort of busy. I'm taking 14 hours, and my classes are Statistics, Latin 506, Psych, and Microeconomics. They're all pretty good so far, all my professors are pretty nice. I've had a lot of reading to do, and I've been pretty much doing my best to do it all. I'm waiting for a couple of books to come in. I'm waiting for my Microeconomics book and a Latin book to come in. I really wanted to take Intro to Political Philosophy instead of Latin, but oh well. I'm thinking about doing International Business, and Latin is the basis of all the Romance languages, so I hope it will help me with other languages. International Business seems to be like an interesting major, but I still don't know what I want to do. I'm probably doing Pre-Med as well, and I also want to take some RTF classes. I don't think that you can take RTF classes without majoring in it though, so I'm going to have to apply to that college, I guess. I hope I figure out what I want to do because International Business, Pre-med, and RTF are pretty hard to do all together, and I don't want to take longer than four years to finish all that. I honestly don't know what I want to do, I want to do something worthwhile, something different, something exciting, something that's definitely not your average 8 to 5 job, something that truly helps people. I only hope that someday I will realize what I want to do. Although in life, everyone wants something more, no matter what people have, they usually want something more. I hope that whatever happens, I am content with what I have. Man, this Shins song, ""Saint Simon"" is so good. They're coming to Austin soon, I can't wait to see them. Bright Eyes is also coming soon, in October. That is going to be such a good show, it's been like two years since I've seen them live. I think that I can do those three things in four years though, if I take summer school, I think. I came in with 36 hours of credit, so I really hope that it's possible. I need to talk to my advisor about that. He's really nice, his name is Lovelys. He's also my FIG mentor, I am in the Business of Non-Profits FIG. I've always been really interested in Non-Profit Businesses and how they run. Maybe I'll work for a Non-Profit Business. We're supposed to get guest speakers, and we're doing a Community Service project, so that will be cool. Well, my time's almost up, so I'll end here. Ciao. "
Tell me about yourself.,"This is what I need to do. Type with my friends in the messenger its really ADDICTING. LMaoOO. Well I love to listen to music. Its really soothing for me and I fell weird with out it. I LOVE TUTY of BRazeros Musical( ; ; my favorite group) I wonder when they are going to come back. (this there one of there songs. Lloviendo esta y atra vez de la lluvia te llevas con tigo a la cuidad entera mis lagrimas no miras la lluvia las confuendedn y aunque yo este llorando por mi no te preocupes. Te esperare te esperare aunque no vuelas mas. Llenaste mi rtecuerdos a la cuidad entera. Y aunque yo se que nunca mas tu volveras. "" Lagrimas y Llubia by Brazeros Musical. Who did I get backstage. It was all a rush. But am glas I did. I meet one of my favorite groups. They were nice. There performance was great. Although at the end they stinked musty and were all sweaty they were forth it. Armando and Junior were the cutest of them all. I was surprised that Luis recognized me. there is nothing special about me and well. He was remembered how my face looked like. I Hate this song put I cannot tell my roommate its from the 80s or something like that its OLD. ""In the car wash. "" maybe because I heard it for too long. Its a remix. Its lonely in my room. I have nothing to do but be here in the computer. Reflecting back on high school it was exciting but I wish we could've done better things to make it wonderful and more unforgettable. I Made it to PROM Court. I was Beaten by a girl That never attended school. How can all these people that don't go to school ever always pass and get better things then me and my friends. We were all great students. And never broke the rules!!! Its beb 11 mins and well I have a million things tuning through my head. I miss my family (as whole) because they went to MEXICO with out me. This the first year they do it and I feel left out. But am having a blast here in the University of Texas and I cannot ask for anything better. I Love Austin. This were I been living for 18 years. I think I love music because of this ""The Live Music Capital of the World"" music was everywhere I turned in the neighbors house, down in the drive through of McDonalds. In the Laundry thing and well my mom Loves to dance. Which leaves me think. What am I going to do with my obsession of taking pics of different artist that come and do concert. I love to meet them and makes my groups of friends grow more. ""the artist"" for most part are really down to earth and I look forward to every dance there is. Its Been two weeks since school started, yet our room still STINKS!!!!!! We cannot take the smell out. Being in the ninth floor. We cannot do much of it. plus were in the middle of Nowhere land stuck in a Corner were no body comes an visit us. That's good in some part because we can study and listen to music as high as we want to and none says anything. Its sunny outside its not HOT like it usually is. I love it when it rains but there is also going to rain. That little breeze of air that vlows thriugh my hair is unbelivable. I love that smell of wet grass as well. UMmmmmmmmmmmm. So one did PoPcoRn and I smell it all the way over here. 10,9,7,6,5,4,3,2,1 sorry I got distracted by the timer less then am done. It been distracting since it started "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm finally getting around to typing this stream of consciousness thing. I don't know why I was procrastinating before, maybe hesitant because I'm subconsciously afraid of what I'd write. But my dorm doesn't start its, um, food service thing for 20 minutes and I'm getting tired of uploading all my course assignments from syllabi up to Mozilla Calendar. I'm already typing more coherently than I thought I was going to (caffeine, maybe? Doesn't it clear and speed up your thought process?) 1:56 already. If I get to the cafeteria too early I'll have to have cereal or something just kicking around until they start preparing real food; that happened earlier today, for the first time in fact, because I ignored the Castilian Food Service schedule. I guess I'm bound to forget some stuff over the long weekend, first time going back home from Austin. Roommate's explaining The Facebook to suitemate right now. His music used to be catchy, but he needs to get more variety. I've heard Beenie Man and uhhhhh Young Buck maybe two dozen times a day, it's dumbening me. I was expecting my writing to be more Ulysses-like; that's a great book: I even brought it to my dorm but haven't had time to read any of it all (not that I did at home, either) There's a guy in my intro linguistics class that looks a lot like James Joyce, down to the facial hair and everything. God he's annoying, sucking up to Herr Doktor and asking questions that --- A nerf basketball just hit me. Damn --questions to which the answers are overly obvious. Not that I have anything against him for looking like James Joyce. I picked my glasses because they looked Joycean (My dad has the same glasses as Noam Chomsky). The tiny old Vietnamese woman (7:23) at my optometrists (all the employees have been Vietnamese. Ong, Doan, Tran, Quach, Nguyen, &c. ) said something bizarre about them making me 'look powerful'. It sounded cool at the time, but in retrospect it was really creepy. (8:39)  Suitemate probably thinks I'm vaguely antisocial because I'm typing furiously instead of playing Nerf basketball with him and my roommate. The ball just went under my bed; there, he got it. Missed it from as far back as my bed, dropped it again, shot again. I was tempted to bring ummmmm not Ulysses. Finnegan's Wake (no apostrophe, I remembered) up to my room, as my roommate seems not to care that I already have too lofty of literature here (I was afraid of seeming to effete if I was stuck with some anti-intellectual jock from College Station, but it's fine) but I already have enough unread books on my shelf. Not that I don't intend to read it all sometime. Last time I checked I was on page 168 which I think is quite far for something with almost no coherence at all. Somewhere I read that Joyce revised the text continuously, making it more and more obscure and pun-filled and incoherent with each revision. which would make Strauss happy. It's funny what you learn from Harpers Magazine. Apparently the record at shots at the Nerf basketball hoop from printer-desk range is 4. Or maybe 8. Maybe Adam made 8 and David 4? I wasn't really paying attention, but  Ooh, my sister just signed onto AIM. We need to try that Mediterranean restaurant on 24th sometime. I occasionally laugh or say something noncommittal or vaguely supportive to show that I'm paying attention to their little basketball game David made 3 now. Adam's trying from distance, missed. Standing right next to me, apparently I'm 3 point range. When I grow up I bet I'll have to patronize my kids similarly. 16:14 I can eat before too terribly long, then I'll have to read for history and such and add this class to mozilla calendar  David just backed into me. Ewww This 50 cent song is so violent. At first I thought it was catchy, but really it's just creepy. 17:41  He's putting the Onion volume 14 back on my shelf, upside down. They're leaving for dinner, asked me if I wanted to come, explained psych writing assignment. He doesn't think he like's quesadillas. They're ok, but I prefer them without too much stuff in them. Which they always have, except that it's the do-it-yourself line which should remedy that. So I'll be down in a few seconds. unless the elevators take too long which they do. What else. AIM. Got my course packets today. IT was easier to find but Abel's I had to search for.  DONE! "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well. Actually, I don not know what should I write down here. I think that this can be a very easy assignment, or this can be a very hard assignment. How stupid! Honestly, today, I asked about it to a TA because I could not totally understand what should I do? I knew that there is no topic, but no topic can mean the huge categories. Anyway, this assignment made me confused. But, interestingly, a American student asked about what she should do for the assignment in the today's class. At that time, I thought two. One is that there is also a person who do not understand the purpose of this assignment like me. And. the other is that ""Oh, my god! Don't ask me. Don't ask me. Because I am an international student who came here in America a month ago. So. I am not good at listening to what people say yet, especially in the casual conversation. You know, young American university students talk so fast. Hum~~~ it is a big problem. So, I made her ask the same question three times, and finally, I could tell her what she should do for this assignment. How stupid!! Now. I am in a big dilemma. I have a difficulty keeping up with classes now, but I feel happy and can relax when I meet friends and drink with them. But, I have to study. So, I thought that now, I have to meet lots of friends to learn English instead of only studying in the library to keep up with classes. I thinks it is a great excuse to play. But, what is the priority for me?? Meeting friends to learn English and American culture? Or studying hard to keep up with all classes with no meeting others?? So difficult!! However, I suddenly wonder. Can I deal with both of them perfectly. . . . ?? So confused. Wow, time is almost over. but, I do not much. 36. 37. 38. . . 44. Ok! I have to finish this~~!!  "
Tell me about yourself.,"So I have no idea what I am supposed to be doing with this. just typing I guess. Damn aim. No one ever wants to instant message me until I start doing something. There are so many times when I am just sitting here playing on the computer and doing nothing really, and no one wants to talk. The minute I start doing something productive, there is like five people trying to talk to me at once. All that typing and its only been two minutes. I have no idea what to type. Can your mind really go blank?  I mean, I want to use the expression right now, my mind is blank, because I'm not really thinking about anything, but obviously I'm thinking about something because I am typing this stuff. So my mind really isn't blank then. So I guess your mind doesn't really ever go blank. My roommate is funny. I keep picturing her when I walked in the door from class earlier. She was asleep on the couch but she had the pillow on her face. How someone can sleep with a pillow on their face is beyond me. Its looked so funny though. I should have took a picture. I'm really sleepy already and its only going to be seven o'clock in the evening. I am still not used to this getting up early for class stuff. Ah. The new real world is on tonight. I absolutely love watching that show. All the drama. Its interesting to watch. Its kind of sad though I think, the way people love to watch reality shows. I mean, they are not really a true picture of reality. They film for hours and hours and hours, but the show itself is usually only a half hour episode, and they usually only run for a few months, once a week. Can u imagine how much film ends up on the ""cutting room floor"" as they call it. All the drama and stuff is pretty much made up by producers if you think about it. If not made up completely at least embellished. And its all because of editing. Birthday. Someone on TV just said the word birthday. I'm so excited. My birthday is a week from tomorrow. Yeah!  but I also have my dad's birthday next week and my boyfriend's too. And I have no idea what to get them. Actually what to get my boyfriend. My dad is easy. A gift certificate for tools or golf stuff and he is happy. My boyfriend. I don't know. He already has plenty of cologne (did I spell that right?) so I don't want to get him that. And I always buy him clothes. I want to get him something different this time but I have no idea what. And he is going to be 21. Lucky. Everyone is leaving me behind. I am the youngest of a lot  of my friends. So now they can all go out to the bars. Without me. So sad. I still have a whole year to go. Bleh I hate waiting. Bleh. Is that a word? I type it a lot on aim. Its my way to say yucky or boring or I don't know. I heard it from somewhere though. I can't remember where. Ha-ha. My roommate is up. I wonder if she knows she was sleeping with a pillow on her face. Because it fell off when I came in. Bleh. I am not looking forward to waking up early tomorrow again. I think we should have a fall break. kind of like spring break. I need my rest. Its only the third week of school and I'm already so exhausted. I need a break.     "
Tell me about yourself.,"my boyfriend is in the room and he stinks like a dirty/sweaty boy. I came over to his apt to do this homework. and then we were going to go to tops as well to get some super cute pictures of ourselves. I am also eating cheetos so it it causing me to type slower than normal. I'm usually a really fast typer, because I've had a computer for a long time. my dad is a programmer so we have always had a computer in our house. he wanted me to do computer science and I did as well, but when I came to UT I found out it is totally wrong for me. I just switched to retail merchandising and I'm not sure if that is right for me either but better than CS was. I think its funny how older people(no offense) are not really connected to the computer. the computer, can do so many wonderful things, I can't even see my life without one. don't think I'm a dork just because I said I was in CS, but take for example doing this homework online. its just so much easier to sit here and type and then turn it in electronically and then its saved to some machine and no one really had to put too much effort into it. it was a very easy/simple task. that's amazing. they said that my generation will spend like 12 years of there life online and I believe it. there is just so much to do online. I feel like I might be typing bad, but I'd like you to excuse that. I'm not really checking spelling and what not just typing. I wonder what you actually look for in these type of things, how you judge people off what they typed and then how you sort them into groups. I mean I'd hate to see what you think of me now, but it would be interesting to see if any of it really matched up to be true. so I totally love Paris Hilton, she is such a riot. I think its funny people don't like her because she has everything and because of the way she acted on her show. but I wont get into that, however she came out with a new book. I want to read it, I think it will be amusing. on a side note, I'm not really sure why I'm eating cheetos, I don't really like them, just every now and then I crave them. I absolutely hate how they make your mouth orange and gross feeling. I just   dropped one on my lap and it left that residue and its gross to think that is all in  your teeth. I really hope this thing is self timed and not expecting me to be timing myself. I never realized 20 minutes would feel like so long. maybe because I'm starving and I just want to go eat and go to tops, it feels like that. I hate that. how are you suppose to do something  that feels like eternity. I feel bad because its like my boyfriend is waiting on me to finish this so we can go. I was going to do it earlier but I was having a hard time getting the pre-screening thing to work. then once I did it takes so freaking long to load each page its like pointless. you almost just want to not look and just click each thing as fast as you can to get it over with, because its so freaking slow. I still have to go back and finish that and I dread it. however, I think my boyfriend is entertained now because I can here he is playing playstation two in the next room. gosh I'm so hungry and this is taking way to long. I have now moved on to goldfish to eat. speaking of eating in that pre screening thing all those questions about food and over eating. wow. I feel bad that so many people have eating disorders, I know quite a few. so many things for girls to be stressed about. I hate how people just think you can diet and loose it all. they think its all just food related. I hate how little kids are so fat today. I wish people would help teach kids how to eat. they let them eat ANYTHING. they are so worried about other things it seems like they forget to teach them about diet and exercise. or they don't set the example themselves. my hair stylist has this really great trick where she only lets her kids have 1 coke aka soda per day and they only get it in the evening if they have done ALL their homework and their daily chore. then they also get a snack  sized candy (the little bitty bite size) as a treat as well for doing their homework and stuff and the kids thing that is such a treat. then there are kids who drink like 8 cokes a day. crazy crazy. I wonder what it is like for your generation to look down on us and you probably think we are all lazy. we use the computer for everything and our clothes and music. its just rather funny how everyone is amazed by the last generation. I'm really starting to wonder is this is self timed or computer timed. I can't imagine it not being computer timed. I can't imagine being the person who reads all this crap. it has to get old and what happens if you miss something important?  that could suck all that work and you miss a small detail. but that could happen anywhere I guess. I'm so hungry its not funny. I'm glad I don't have to pee or anything that would just suck. I feel like my mind is going blank because I'm so bored. I wonder if people ever fall asleep doing this. it would be easy. gosh its really bothering me the time thing at the top doesn't have any numbers. like its keeping time per say. I'm quitting this at 4 o'clock even if this thing doesn't stop itself because I know I'll be over the time if I wait till 4 so you can't cut my grade cause your thing didn't work. oh crap this clock is fast so I'll quit like 8 min before 4 and that should be even. I feel like I started this at 3:30 hmmmmmm I can't really remember. damn it. this sucks ass. I don't see how this is helping you. just making me get annoyed because I don't know when I started so i dont know when I can end and just go on with my life. I wonder if you really do read all of these or just skim it or run it through a word finder. I feel like this is pointless and I'm past my typing time. I have no concept of time, but I don't know if anyone really does. just depends on what they are doing or what's going on around them and etc. time is a funny thing. more goldfish to cure my growling stomach/boredom. ouch I just kicked the computer or something underneath me. and it hurt. to bad I'm not on my computer cause then I could be laying in bed doing this. wireless and laptops. genius. the count down to me hitting the finish button and quitting all of this is t-minus 3 minutes and counting. 3:55 will be the new time for completion. 3 more minutes. and I'm stumped. I don't know what to type/talk about. ooooooo 2 minutes and counting. ok randomness:  I am not sure what I'm going to do tonight, I might go to a party or something, however I'm not going to dress up really cause I'm just feeling a chill vibe. 0ne minute. . and probably have a few drinks, or either rent movies and stay the night in with my boyfriend. sweet guy. not sure we are completely on the same page, but we have years for that to develop. . Times up. "
Tell me about yourself.,"So this is the third time that I have tried to do this for some reason my computer is having some problems this morning. Explorer crashed and so I had to reboot my machine which can take a while. It's amazing how slow PC's get after you install Anti-Virus software. In the process of it rebooting I went and made a cup of coffee. Bavarian Hazlenut form HEB, delicious. So I was thinking about this assignment and how it was similar to an assignment I took in a Humanities class a while back. They asked us to spend 20 minutes alone somewhere, anywhere just thinking about anything and making notes. I spent it in the campus parking lot, a wide open space, fairly peaceful, trees swaying in the summer breeze and began making notes, not really sure of the purpose. After the 20 minutes was up I realized that I was much more in tune with all of my senses than at the start. Normally I would walk around just using the sense that were needed, sight, hearing and focused on coordination, driving, etc. During the 20 minute period in the parking lot I became aware much more of my sense of touch, the feel of the paper I was writing on, the smell of my surroundings, the movement of the trees as they swayed in the breeze, I've mentioned that twice now, what does that mean?  I just finished my first cup of coffee. My apologies about my spelling. I have a tendency to just type first and ask questions about my spelling later. I don't know how this app handles me jumping back to correct spelling. I hope I'm not confusing it. Probably not. A thought of sunny beaches just jumped into my head for no reason. South Padre on a breezy summer evening. Again this breeze thing, what's with that?  In fact I'm thinking about the breeze that may be outside right now. I just went out to feed the cats and it was cool and a little breeze was in the air. Perhaps I need to go outside when I'm done here and soak it up. It's like a vitamin that the body is lacking, eventually you crave something that subconsciously you know gives you that vitamin. For some reason , perhaps I didn't get out enough at the weekend, I need to feel the breeze.  Central Market,  I have a coupon to Central Market sitting in front of me. I like that place and apparently if I go there this week and spend $30 or more then I can get $10 off rib-eye steaks. The fan spins slowly overhead, a gentle clicking, a low hum,  the sound of my typing and then, silence. Why are keyboards so awkward. Isn't there a better way to do this. Surely a Psychologist somewhere has studied this and come up with something, more ergonomic. I'm thinking about my brother. I just spent 2. 5 months in the U. K. during the Summer working for him, selling. They are a web services company. He is the owner and a good guy. He is the glue that keeps many things together. He has 3 kids who are all precious. One has a spine problem and can't walk. That unfortunately is the extent of my knowledge. English people are strange in that they make it hard to communicate simple things to each other. They do things that they think are right but in fact are completely wrong. I got attacked while I was in the U. K. In the street at 8:30 in the morning on Friday the 13th. I was on my way to work and got attacked. The Police there are awful. They just don't care. They are nowhere to be found. In the most obvious situations where you would think they would be they hide and when you least need them they are there to hassle you. I have not been hassled but they are that kind of personality. Just my impression. Power hungry wimps. No idea for the big picture, just CYA and demonstrate what little power you have. Why can't they quantities the biggest problems and formulate a response and go about resolving it. Did you know that England has now clearly taken over the spot of the capitol for drunks in Europe. The British government will be introducing laws next year to combat the problem. Why do they not have a public intoxication law now????  You can be drunk in the street hassling old ladies and get away with it while the police stand by and chat to one another!!!!  Well my time is almost up in fact a notice just came up. Time to go. Hope this has not been boring. Have a great day. Go USA!!! "
Tell me about yourself.,I am currently thinking about how ready I am to go home this weekend. I didn't go home for labor day weekend because my girlfriend came here to visit me. I can't wait to see her and see if she is feeling better. She has been sick for the last four days. I also can't wait to drive my new car. I just got it this summer but I haven't been able to drive it because I don't want to bring it to Austin. I wonder what we are going to do in Psychology today? I wonder if he is going to do another demonstration like he did last class? I just drew a blank and can't think of what to say next. I really want to go watch a movie this weekend because I haven't went to the movies in a really long time. I wonder what I will buy Kim for her birthday in December? Probably some flowers and some chocolate and maybe buy her a gift certificate to get a massage. I wonder what she will buy me for Christmas? She said it was something I have been wanting but I didn't know I have been wanting anything. I hope the camera I bought on Saturday is going to be here this week. I bought the new Sony DSC-T1 which is the credit card size digital camera sony makes. I can't wait to get it I have been wanting the camera now for six months. I miss my 1967 Camaro. I restored it this year and during the summer I went to Florida and traded it in for a 2002 SS Camaro. Wow what a change that car hauls butt and is nice because it has air conditioning which the 67 didn't. I still have my 68 Camaro and I will probably be wanting to restore that one pretty soon. My dream is to be a Orthodontist and I can't stop thinking about if and when I will realize if this dream could be a reality. I know I have to wait 3 more years to apply to dental school but I can't tell if I will have high enough grades to get accepted. I really hope my Chemistry class isn't as hard as I am making it out to be. I took Chemistry AP last year in high school so I would be prepared but I feel a little discouraged. I wonder what experiments I will sign up for in Psychology. I have been looking but I haven't found one with my interest? I wonder if my dad is really going to help me get a racecar because I have always wanted to race and two weeks ago we went to the track to see if we were interested and my dad said we probably will race next year. My father raced when he was my age and I have always wanted to follow in his footsteps. He was very good and I have seen proof from the programs that he was in. I am starting to smell the food I just recently cooked. It smells like pizza. Maybe because that's what I fixed. DUH. My eyes are starting to hurt from looking at the screen without looking away. I am getting really annoyed by the people living on the top floor. They keep making noise. It sounds like an elephant is walking on top of me. It is disrupting my train of thought. I am really hoping that tonight I can take a break and not have to do any homework. 
Tell me about yourself.,"wow I just turned on my music a little too loud. that really scared me for a second. let's get this straightened out a bit I'm so glad I'm listening to this cd it reminds me of Chris, who I miss terribly at the moment. I wonder why he didn't call me back last night well I guess it was really late and he probably had stuff to do, his chemistry homework and stuff like that. I think it's really funny that his roommate's name is hank and he's Chinese, that's just funny. my feet are really cold even though I have on socks and my slippers I guess it's just that I always get really cold in hardin house I don't know why they keep it like a refrigerator in here. everything's going to be alright, rockabye. I like this song a lot. all her friends tell her she's so pretty, she'd be a whole lot prettier if she smiled once in a while. so Fiji has a foam party planned for tomorrow night and I think that's going to be a lot of fun, except I don't know, the thought of being in a room of foam really freaks me out. I get really claustrophobic, especially when I feel like I can't breathe, kind of like when I go to sleep and I like to pull the covers up over me but I always have to make sure there's a way for a lot of air to get in and out because otherwise it just freaks me out. anyways, I think it'll be fun but I'm not sure if I'm going to get in the whole way. I've been in a whiteout once, that one in beaver creek or wait no it was park city and that was so scary, I kind of think this would be like that except a lot closer and like in your face, and hopefully not as cold. though part of what makes me claustrophobic is when you get all hot and everything as well as not being able to breathe, like you feel like you can't get any fresh air like a breeze or anything. but I still really want to go in just for a minute to say I've done it. but Leila was telling me about how people like do stuff in the foam, and I don't know I'm worried because mark is a Fiji which makes me kind of not want to go over there I wonder why he's been telling his friends about me I really don't like that because I really don't like him and I know he likes me but he's kind of crazy and obsessive almost, though he's really nice, it just seems like he tries way too hard. like too hard to be so interested in your conversation and be listening and just making that ""hmmmmmm. interesting. "" like too pleasant psychologist kind of face that makes me think he's like analyzing everything I say, like I sound stupid but he's just not saying anything kind thing. I don't know I just really don't like that at all. and I think he's a little gay. well maybe not gay, but definitely metro. I think it's really funny that I've spelled definitely my whole life, and it's always been wrong but I just can't retrain myself to get it right. kind of like weird or weird. I still get them mixed up because I know I used to always write it one way and it was wrong, but now I don't know which way is right because I can never remember if I ever actually fixed it or not. I think it's weird. weird. whatever. weird. that looks a lot more right than the other way so hey we're going to go with that. I don't know what I think about will. he's also a Fiji, so if I go to foam I get to see him but I also have to deal with mark, so that's kind of like a double-edged-sword-damned if you do damned if you don't situation. I got sick of the hyphens. anyways, I think he's a really sweet guy and all, but he's just so quiet! but at the same time it's like I'm drawn to him almost because he's a dry pledge and he's cute but not all at the same time, I'm sick of this song and I'm changing it this one is happier but back to will I just don't know what I think of him. or that. whatever. I am leaving cause I love you, I am leaving cause I don't and I'm hoping you will follow and I'm praying that you won't let me go. I want to know who sings this song, Chris never told me. I still can't believe he made me all those cds on the night he left it was really fun to talk to bo yesterday, I really liked talking to him he seemed so lonely and desperate to talk to someone his own age. I miss bo. I could never tell if he really liked me or not, kind of like Travis, because it always seemed like we had the same kind of conversation every time, like hey bo how you doing I'm good ok talk to you later awkwardness kind of thing. I don't know. scratch my neck. anyways I never really knew about that but I've always liked him, 3ven after he insulted the cake at my 16th birthday party, I can't believe he didn't remember that at all and I thought it was so funny that he was just completely horrified at himself. I love that story, it's almost as classic as the cookie analogy from homecoming my sophomore year when he and Chris both wanted to ask me, and then after that when bo liked me and I liked Chris and they were fighting over me. I wonder if it was right that I brought it up that last night we were all together that was so much fun I can't believe I actually stayed there until 4 in the morning and I'm glad Chris never lit his cigar up around me that really would have made me mad even though I know bo really wanted him to, I'm glad bo didn't force the issue too much though because I would have felt bad but I didn't want him to do that around me I hate smoking so much I hope Andrew quits it'll kill him I think it's so funny that Leila figured out that he was the guy that was making out with marry at the Fiji island party, I'm glad I wasn't there because I think I would have been really embarrassed. I guess that's part of the thing about always being the sober one at different places. it's a lot of fun because you can laugh at the people that are just getting really drunk and doing stupid things but at the same time you have to take care of people and it's like you get embarrassed for them because they just have no idea what they're doing. but I like not drinking, and I like feeling like I don't have to and people accept that. it's really kind of nice wow I only have like 3 and a half minutes left that's pretty cool. but I sure am getting there. two dimes in the telephone alright, no it's not easy tonight. good song I really do love this cd I wonder if Michelle is ever going to get me that nello cd, I really would love that. or maybe if Chris could give me the cd that has that new nello song on it I loved that. he first played that for me outside of casey's house. what were we doing over there? were we going to a concert or something. maybe? I don't remember. ha-ha Hailey used to always say we went over there to see casey's brothers. they're so hot. but Kevin's married now. I don't like how I just sounded like a bimbo there I really am smart I promise. I feel really stupid in my world lit class though because I've never taken Latin and I haven't studied Greek, and I don't know I just feel like I'm behind the ball here on Dante's inferno. I like the book a lot but I'm worried about the first paper that we have due in a few weeks. starting a paper and getting the initial idea is always the worst part by far. so don't make the wrong impression I don't want raffa to think I'm like stupid it's like in hagood's class though I guess I just have to learn when to speak up, it's like I'm wow that just interrupted me and I had no idea where I was going. . I guess I just get writing and I have to get really into the stream of consciousness without letting myself put myself into editor mode. I guess that's what I have to do when I start writing a paper because instinctively I start editing myself before I even begin and then I just end up never really getting anywhere. well I'm done here. goodbye. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Damn, I'm really hungry. My girlfriend was really hungry too, so she came over to make some Spaghetti. I guess it's already almost 6pm, so dinner wouldn't be a bad thing. In fact, it would be a good thing. It's pretty hot outside today. I have a horrible crick in my neck. Almost like I've been looking in the same direction for ages and never had my hinges oiled. When I look to the left, it all seems to go away. Perhaps I should start sitting on the other side of the classrooms. I should start studying more often. I passed my Computer Proficiency Test today. not like I was terribly worried about it though. I had my first quiz at UT today as well. I ended up reading for my Financial Accounting class for an hour and a half at the AIM reading room at the school of business. I did a few homework problems at the end, but didn't finish them. If I would have been reading for my MIS class, I probably would have been prepared for the quiz. It's pretty straightforward stuff though--especially with me being a certified Microsoft and Citrix network administrator. My roommate Chad has been really sketchy lately. I think it has to do with the fact that we moved in together as 'eligible bachelors' after both breaking up from serious relationships. DAMN, those Italian herbs smell really good. It's making my mouth start to water really bad. I took a painting class last semester and did a few works -- one of them is sitting on my desk and keeps catching my attention. I also have a double Dave's cup on my desk -- which is one of my favorite places to eat. I think I'm going to turn some music on now [empty thoughts] I'm now listening to the sound of 311 (their self titled album to be more specific) I wonder if you all will actually read these. My thought pattern seems to have become more spaced out since I've started listening to the music. Oop--now it's picking up again. I have a stack of CD's on top of my monitor. Do you?  Do you have a stack of anything?  I once saw a stack of hay at my friends ranch. The code to their ranch was 1991, because that's the year they purchased it. The funny thing is, he now incorporated that number plus the first initial of him, his mom, his dad, and his two dogs into being his screen name. This sucks that the time is going by so slowly. At first it seemed to pass by really quickly--with the lines of text slowly appearing, but the time going by in increments of 30 seconds. The spaghetti is ready. Damnit, I'm hungry but I have to sit here for a little while more and type to no one. I wonder why brass was chosen as a doorknob color. Maybe because it looks similar to gold -- and gold is a precious commodity. My stomach feels like it's burning right now. Those aromas are filling my nose. WOOOOO HOOOOO! My girlfriend, Laura, just brought me a plate full of Spaghetti and Meatballs.  to have a bite  As much as I really want to sit here and keep typing, I think I'm going to grab a drink to pair with my spaghetti. Dr Pepper is pretty awesome. I can type and watch TV at the same time. I never thought being able to type without looking would be that good of a thing Now I get to use it while trying to complete my psychology assignment. Yeeeaaaah! The assignment is over. "
Tell me about yourself.,"this writing assignment is very interesting. it is strange how it is somewhat difficult to simply write whatever I am thinking. sometimes it is hard to tell. I really need to catch up on some of my homework. I also need to find a job. high school was so much different than college is. that isn't necessarily a bad thing. just different. I like living in Austin. there is much more to do than there is in a town of under 300 people. I am hungry. where should I eat lunch today. my parents are coming down this weekend. I think I'll leave. to many people in a little apartment. I don't really think I could handle it. I got a cat. well a kitten actually. to keep my company. it whines a lot. and likes to crawl up my leg. I haven't really talked to that many people from back home since I have been here. but that doesn't really bother me. I need new people. meeting people here is harder than I thought it would be. I figured since this is a huge campus that it would be easy and just kind of happen. but it turns out I think I might actually have to make an effort to meet new people. I really need to find a job. hopefully on-campus. that would be great. I am looking forward to psychology class today. it is interesting. I want to learn how people think. because I wish I knew a lot of the time. but I don't really think that is something you can learn. because everyone's mind works differently, so how can you learn how people think if it not the same with any one person?  how can you know the emotions and thoughts of the people around you?  I have a hard time knowing the thoughts and emotions of my closest friends. and even myself at times. the mind is so complex. I have thought about majoring in psychology. I just wish I had some clue as to what I want to do with my life. it's like I am here, in college, finally, and I have no idea what to do with it. I guess I will figure it out. I just get tired of waiting for that sudden thought to just pop into my head and me know that is what I want to do for the rest of my life. that's a long time. I want to do something I enjoy. somewhere where I will be happy. but I guess that is what everybody wants. but why do some people find that, and not others. what makes the lucky ones different. I guess if everyone did what the wanted then there would be nobody to do the dirty work. but it just seems unfair that some have it so could. and some can never find that place where they feel content. does that place really exist? I think so. I don't think I have quite found it though. I think I will though. maybe I'll be one of those lucky ones. I miss Jason. is this going to work?  do I want it to?  I do but there are so many things to experience here. will it change me? he thinks so. but I don't know. maybe it will. maybe it should. but where does that leave us? is there an us?  I have no idea how to handle that situation. my parents are going crazy. they miss me so much. I miss them, but am relieved to not be in there household anymore. I needed some freedom. I need to learn to live on my own. I really don't want a job though. it will be hard to balance work and school and homework. but I need to money. I guess I have to eat and pay rent. I am really getting hungry. I am not really that tired considering I got up at 7 this morning. surprising. I haven't even taken a nap. I don't think I will. I rode the shuttle from my apartment this morning. I usually drive. but I can't afford to pay $7 everyday. it wasn't that bad. but I didn't really know where it was going to take me. but I made it to class on time. and didn't have to walk that far. I just hope I am able to catch it this afternoon. I think I know where it will pick me up. but I don't know what time it runs really. and how late it runs. but I should be done here around 5. cause I have a class from 3:30 till 5. I really need to go to the gym. I think I am going to talk some dance classes. that sounds like fun. and I bet it will help me meet more people. I need to talk to Jason. let him know I care and that I think about him a lot. I know he worries. I worry to. I need to quit stressing about everything so much. I worry myself to much. I guess that is human nature though. who knows what human nature really is. maybe that is just an excuse for the way we act. I know I use it as an excuse at times. that's kind of sad. but I guess everyone probably does. wow my times almost up. that didn't seem like 20 minutes. when you just start letting your thoughts go I guess time goes by pretty quickly. I think I might take a nap. but I have more homework that needs to be done. dang there is so much reading. I get tired  "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now I'm feeling overwhelmed at all the work that has been given to me. There is so much reading that I have to get done and so little time with all the classes I am taking. Right now I am thinking of a way to manage my time and get everything done. Right now I am hearing dead silence as my roommates and I are all studying in the same room. I am also hearing the fan and the doors slam from others people who are down the hall from me. Right now I am feeling very tired and my eyes are about to shut but I'm trying my best to stay awake. As I type, I'm thinking about other work that needs to be done by tomorrow and wondering if I'm ever going to get that done tonight. At this instant I'm noticing how  there are so many pictures of friends in front of me and how much I miss them. I'm wondering about how tomorrow's classes are going to be and what other will be assigned for that day. I am also thinking about how hard my classes are and how I am going to pass them. I'm trying to figure out a way to manage my time, a way to prevent me from procrastinate, and a way to stay in control with my study habits. Right now I also feel sad because I really miss my family. It's so hard for me to be away from them because I'm so close to them. I especially miss my little bother and little sister. They always make me laugh. Today my day was tough. I hardly understood what was going on in there so I had to stay after class and ask questions. As for my critical thinking seminar, I had a hard time participating mainly because of what the topic was about. Right now I'm hearing no noise at all and it's just making me tired. I feel very cold right now because the fan is right in front of me and it's making my eyes dry.         "
Tell me about yourself.,"It smells really good in my apartment. My roommate's girlfriend is making chicken and I'm cooking out. I love Monday night football. Its on tonight. it is Thursday night but this is the opening game but abc is covering the game. watching football is putting me in a good mood. I am in the process of cooking out on the grill. I'm really tired right now but I have a test tomorrow. last night I had like three hockey games. on real game and then the school team, we had practice. we got a new dog and it sometimes keeps me up at night. he is a jack russel terrier and his name is miller. the washing machine is going and it is really loud. just like the dishwasher. the patriots are winning now they just kicked a field goal. my girlfriend is doing her homework over in the dining room. I wonder what she is working on. the dishwasher stopped and now it is quiet in here. john madden annoys me. I'm not really watching the game because I'm doing this but I hear him commenting on the game. all he does is state the obvious. I don't need to hear him tell me what I just saw. I can believe he gets paid. I hope I get a good job like that were I get paid very well and the job can be fun. it just got really hot in my apartment really fast. I need to turn down the thermostat. I don't want to study tonight. I just want to chill. I am worrying occasionally because I changed my major and I am now trying to get into upper division. my new major is sport management. it used to be economics. a beer would great right now. I just saw a Coors light commercial. that's good advertising. well I'm halfway done with this thing. there is not much to say I just keep thinking of the same things. I hope Texas football wins this weekend. Arkansas beat us last year but I think we will beat them this year. I need to go put the meat on the grill because I am hungry. I have to do this for 7 more minutes then I can do that. I'm cooking this really good sausage that my girlfriend bought in Elgin, Texas. I'm so hungry. its making it worse because of my roommates food that they are making is smelling really good. hopefully the patriots will win this game. they are winning this game. they won last year in the conference championship. I'm ready for the hockey season to start. I wish I could go play hockey tonight. I wonder what my dog is doing. my roommate is yelling at him so I'm sure he is doing something mischievous because he is always doing stuff like that. be quiet john madden. this is a long twenty minutes. I'm still hungry. I'm ready for the weekend. it will be fun. dang the patriots are punting. I need a new car. mine is a 2 door Tahoe that is a 93 so it is eleven year old. I can't wait till next Wednesday for the incubus concert. they are my favorite band and they are coming to Austin to play. it will be sweet. I'm going with all my friends. I should call my mom and let her know what is going on with me I wonder what she is doing "
Tell me about yourself.,"there is so much going on my room right now, some it probably isn't the best time to be writing right now well I guess it'll give them more to think about. There is this song on rt now I think its called legionaries its cool it makes me think of like knights and stuff, its kinds up-beat and fun my roommate is talking to her dad about her palm pilot. I love the way he said boulevard its like the greatest British accent. I've been to Britain well I mean England. Either way I want to have a friend who is British like a guy friend I guess because I don't think id want to date a British guy, they all have gross teeth, I don't really understand that like do they not go to the dentist or know what a toothbrush is or something. Oh I don't think I've ever seen a British person with braces either I guess it has to be something to do with the dentist. I just changed the song on my cd player, the song was called Clementine which reminds me of my favorite movie, well one of my favorite movies, I have like a ton of favorite things, they are never ending. I'm always like yeah this is my fav song or this is my fav band, and the person I am talking to will be like wait I  thought you said that blah blah was your fav band, and then I'm like well yeah them too. Well anyway one of my fav movies eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, its so weird but you know those are fav type of movies, I don't think I have a fav that everyone else like and I don't so it on purpose to be diff or anything oh and by the way I absolutely can't stand those type of people who feel that they have to be diff so they do stuff so blatantly different just so that they will be the center of attention, drives me nuts, like people who dye their hair like crazy colors or people who wear weird like way out there kind of clothes, and I bet is you were to ask them why their hair looks like that or why they're wearing that they'll just tell you. I've lost my train of thought, what I was going to say wasn't really going to make any sense. My roommate uses her palm pilot for everything, I don't know if I could deal using one of those for everything, I couldn't live without my comp, but my cell phone has a lot of the options that palm pilots do like a calendar and alarms a phone book so whatever. I think I should get my blood sugar measured, because I think since I have been at college all I do now is eat, and not healthy foods, I have to have something sweet all the time, it is kind of showing on my figure. I was just thinking about how I looked in a leotard today in my ballet class, I'm not as comfortable being in one as I used to be. Oh this girl in ballet class had just done some center combo with me and we were waiting for everyone else to go and she was like are you gong to try out for the dance team? and I was like no but I think I want to try out for the steel dance company and she was like oh aren't tryouts this weekend? and I was like yeah and she was like oh you will do great you're really really good, I was happy to hear her say that, just to have someone compliment me on my dance skills is such a boost of self esteem especially before tryouts this weekend, I got back to my dorm room and I was so happy, that can also be because I talked to David rt after my class, we are really doing well I think after this weekend, things have steadily been getting back on track with us, I really think I am in love with him, I think the whole break up only made us stronger, that happened the first time we sort of broke up, I wish we could just spend all of our time with each other, I really do miss him a lot, and the thing is if we hadn't broken up this summer I wanted to break up with him before we started college because I wanted to date other people, but the truth is I've only been comparing other guys to him, I guess that's what happens, I mean I have seen cute guys but I haven't really met any yet, so I don't know if that's a good ting or not, anyway David wanted to make it official that we were back together last weekend but its hard because I can't really trust him and neither can my parents, so that really sucks because I really do still want to be with him but my mom is like Seville your a fool and blah blah and sometimes I feel like I kind of am because I start to doubt myself so much about the decision I'm making about us, its like would I follow my heart or mind? it sounds like a stupid line out of a movie but that's really how I feel, I think things are looking up and I think my hearts motives are starting to blend with my mind's  "
Tell me about yourself.,"I just finished taking the prescreening survey and I could not help but feel that some of those questions were ridiculous and repetitive. I'm not even sure that I will agree to participate in any extra surveys even if I'm qualified. I don't feel comfortable being subject to any questionable tests - the guinea pig feeling makes me feel lesser, I guess. I have a lot on my mind concerning a specific event that happened yesterday, and I surprisingly feel comfortable talking about it. I feel alright talking to people, but somehow it's different typing my feelings onto a screen. this screen represents nothing to me right now, I don't know if anyone will ever read or really care about reading this. somehow I'm still making sure that I am spelling words correctly and using acceptable grammar. anyway, the event that I found out about yesterday. involves losing a person that I knew in high school. I can't stop thinking about the fact that just two years ago we were sitting in the same classrooms and wandering the same halls, and now one of us isn't here. it's very clear in my mind that we weren't the best of friends, but we shared the same circle of friends and some of my best friends knew her very well. I personally haven't spoken or seen her since graduation, but I knew she would accomplish everything she wanted and do it better than anyone else. now that I think about it (and I can't stop thinking about it) she is one of the most brilliant people I have met in my life. she graduated 5th in our class, and spent this past summer at Princeton for a research project; definitely someone who was going somewhere. I never thought that something like this could happen to one of ""us,"" the people that basically built the foundation for the person that I am today. I know we weren't the closest that friends could be, but my best friends are wrecks right now, and that affects me. it's a direct and indirect effect, not so much one thing with a yield arrow leading to another thing, but more like a huge web of thoughts that are clinging to me. I'm tangled and I'm not sure where this leaves me. I hate that I can't remember the last thing that we said to each other. nevertheless I was perfectly fine knowing that she was off in her world, and I was off in mine, both separately pursuing the things that we love most in the world. it's not fair that her life wasn't complete enough for her to fulfill everything she wanted to do. it's not fair that they found her the way that they did; it's not fair that we don't know and we won't know for a long time. the truth of what happened. everything is so complex. I can't call anyone; I mean, I can call, but I don't know what I could say that would offer any comfort. it'd be different if I were there with our friends, must to hold a hand or sit next to someone who understands. nobody here at UT went to my high school, and I doubt that anyone on campus can come close to saying that something like this happened to somebody he or she knew. I feel alone, I feel helpless, but at the same time I feel like I'm connected to everyone else who knew her because, well, we're all probably feeling alone right now. college is supposed to help us branch out and find ourselves, become good individuals in this world. at the same time, in the time between our high school graduation and now, we've all become isolated from each other. it sucks that it takes something like this for me to finally feel like we belong together and that the time that we spent together was precious. all time in the world is precious now. things that I was worried about before I heard the news, any stress that I felt weighing on me in the past week has disappeared. homework and little things seem trivial to me. in a way things seem simplified now: we either are. or we aren't. just being here doesn't seem right- but is it selfish to be so so glad that I am here?  I wonder if I deserve it, or if I can earn my place here. then again, who knows if it's so bad on the other side. I see that I have less than three minutes left to stream my consciousness. what a perfect day for me to tell my feelings to nobody in particular, and for them to disappear into a screen as soon as I press ""finish,"" yet for them to linger in my mind still. any other day I would have felt that this assignment was worthless, but I'll admit it. feeling like a part of myself is being put out there-a huge or small risk, I'm not sure-makes me feel the slightest bit better. maybe "
Tell me about yourself.,Ok so I am writing about my thinking. Well tonight was interesting. I had a great time at the Phi Lamb meeting. Laura was really sweet I hope that I will get to know her better. I wonder who my big sister will be in Phi Lamb. Hmm interesting. I love big sisters in organizations. Which is kind of crazy because I just talked to my big sister from the drill team I was a part of in high school. Random. Even though it kind of sucks because my own big sister is completely insane and never talks to me. I promise when I have kids they will never be more than like three years apart. I can't believe that in ten years I will probably be married with kids and all that. Oh my gosh. Where has the time gone? I am actually excited about being a mom. My mom was amazing. She may have some interesting points of view and be a little too concerned with my appearance but you have to love her. No one can argue like her that's for sure. I miss her. But I will see her this weekend. I can't believe how awesome it is that she got tickets to this game. It is crazy. I can't wait to show her around now that campus has started to feel more like a home. Which is totally crazy. I never thought I would get this adjusted to living in a strange new place this fast. But I guess that is a good thing. I will be here for four years so I should probably make it feel like home. So now that my boyfriend calls I am thinking about him. I can't believe I am doing this whole long distance relationship thing. It is the hardest thing in the world. I miss him so much and there is like no way to see him until late October. I wonder if we will make it. I know we can but it is so crazy. Four years of being six hours apart. I wonder what we would be like married. It would be amazing to be his wife. He is the most amazing guy I have ever known. Everything I could ask for he has. But still I get scared sometimes. I wish I could be just a little bit closer with a little more access to him. I guess it is kind of good that we are this far apart because it kind of lets me experience life on my own yet with that amazing love and support only a phone call away. I also know that if we were here together we would spend like all of our time together which wouldn't be good for either of us. I believe you need to explore yourself in college and it would be hard if I had him there with me all the time. Anyways wow it is already eleven. I really like this song. I had never really listened to Jack Johnson but it is very relaxing. I wish song number four would come on it is definitely my favorite or the song that is playing right now I like this one too. It kind of relates to the whole long distance relationship thing which is probably why I like it so much. I wish we had a TV though that would get me away from this computer and talking to people on instant messenger. Which is great but I don't know whatever. Tomorrow is Thursday. I don't really like Thursdays. My classes are harder and there are more of them which is ok I guess. I had a lot of homework for tomorrow. College is a lot different than high school in workload. Like actually having to read all this stuff in every class is crazy. I guess its good that I am typically an overachiever. Well that is what my boyfriend and friends tell me. But whatever. I hope tomorrow goes by fast. I can't wait till Friday. I get to go out on a boat. That is going to be so much fun and then Saturday is the football game. I can't wait for that. I have never been to a UT game so it is definitely going to be an experience. Wow it has been twenty minutes. I guess I am done. Ok bye. 
Tell me about yourself.,"ok so I'm doing this stream of consciousness writing thing and its a little weird, but then again I love to type and just let loose on the computer what my mind is thinking. so this is kind of fun. I just wish that my strep throat/tonsillitis would go away so that tomorrow (Thursday) I can do well in the challenge. and so that I can play well for the clarinet sectional Friday night, because I need to pass off the pregame music by memory and personally, I haven't memorized all of it yet. I guess it comes from being an alternate, because half the time we practiced pregame (which hasn't been much) I was forced to sit on the sidelines and watch. oh boy, don't I love watching. I really hate just sitting there as an alternate, because I feel like I'm a cheap addition to the band. like I wasn't quite good enough to deserve a marching spot. but on the flip side, they must think that I'm good enough because I'm expected to jump in on game day and march pregame if someone is sick, late, drunk, or too hungover to march. I feel bad for thinking this but I kind of want Kelvin's knee to keep him from marching on Saturday. maybe he'll have me march pregame for him, since taps stride is a lot more painful. I don't want to wish that pain on him, though, because he's a sweet guy and deserves to march every game. plus he's a 5th year and he doesn't have many more games left. thank god this room has finally warmed up. or maybe its because I put some pants on. do I smell smoke?? that wouldn't be good. Maybe Gina and I shouldn't leave the towels over the vent. even though it is blocking the freaking cold air from coming through. Oh my goodness this room is so cold in the morning!! holy cow you would think its January, not September! man, sleeping over at rustic's place last weekend was awesome. I was warm the entire night, and when I got hot I just kicked the covers off until I got cold. I guess the fact that I was wearing his pajama pants helped. no nothing happened. he's a really good guy. A Christian. his mom has a funny little story about premarital sex. it has to deal with a unicorn. Yeah I wont go into details. but it proves that he's a good guy. not to mention I spent both Friday and Saturday nights at his place. he didn't try a single thing! funny how dad thinks I trust guys too much, and make myself too 'available'. if only he knew me better, he would know that I'm VERY skeptical with guys. especially after so many of them lying to me. I'm sick of being cheated on and lied to, so I basically play hard to get. I don't think id consider it that, but I don't go easy on them. I'm not the stupid blonde you think I am. I really wish I was one or two steps up on the ladder. my whole life I felt like I wasn't quite good enough. I never won any student council positions, never quite made it to area band, made first chair wind last year on account of a new director but lost it the next semester, made alternate up here at UT, and wasn't elected as Newman representative. I don't understand it. I work my ass off to do the best I can, but that never seems to be good enough. why? my dad was valedictorian at his high school, and if I had good grades in elementary school where did the smarts go? why did I all of a sudden screw up math class in 7th grade? granted mrs glover refused to help me, and probably told me the wrong way to solve problems, but still. I did awesome in 8th grade prealgebra, and then algebra and geometry in high school. but once I hit algebra 2 and precal, shit hit the fan. I just hope I don't have to take calculus in college. but since I don't know what I want to do, I may have to. I really need to get that career test done. I've got to figure out what I want to do with myself by next semester. unless I stay in liberal arts, this whole semester has practically been a waste. not quite, because bio psy and band count (for nursing at least), but other than that. I don't know what I want to do. what do people do if they can't decide? take a lot of random classes I guess, but that's not me. I'm coming in with so many hours that I was hoping to graduate in 3 years. that way if I go to law school I can get in and out before I'm 30, ugly, and still single. I hope I meet someone up here. I'm not built to be single or to date for years to come. ahh nose needs to stop itching. why the heck do I have to be sick? I hate this! once hell week was done I got sick. yeah, that makes the first week of school start off real good. let me tell you. oh well. at least I did all the partying last weekend, before all the symptoms hit. and before my parents decided to come in. dangit! rustin has a kappa kappa psi thing at 8am Sunday morning, which means he probably wont party after the game Saturday night, which means I wont get to spend the night at his apartment because he wont be able to get up and take me back to my dorm at that obnoxious hour. oh but maybe after we paint his living room on Monday I could stay over. I don't have a class until 12:30 so that might work! jeez I'm a dork. I need to stop reading into things like this. the time will come when it decides to come. until then I got to sit back and watch things happen. oh look, I have 10 seconds left. dang "
Tell me about yourself.,"It's only the second week of school, actually the first full week and I'm already so stressed out from studying. I'm not sure exactly how to study but I'm learning. I think maybe I should just make study guides so that's what I'm doing. Oh my gosh, I got to eat at the nicest restaurant last night, TrueLuck's. It was so good and I had such a good time. This past Saturday I wanted to go home so bad and was trying to get my boyfriend to come meet me in Waco to eat. It didn't happen but in the long run I'm glad because I finally made some friends. I'm the kind of person who likes to have a lot of friends to hang out with and usually they are mostly guys. Though this doesn't much help my boyfriend's peace of mind. I'm not sure my roommate is that way but whatever. Anyway, well I met these really cool guys who I really like hanging out with. Sometimes I don't think Ashley likes them as much and it pisses me off because it makes me feel like she thinks I'm wrong to hang with guys because I have a boyfriend and so does she and well we're just really different. Well these guys ended up needing dates to a dinner for their fraternity so we said we'd go, I think Ashley only said yes because she had been drinking. Well I had so much fun and the guy I went with turned out to be really nice. It was great to finally go out and do something with people. I feel more at home now. Now to my boyfriend. We were best friends for 2 years before we even thought about dating. I love him so much and although I'm only 18 I pretty much believe he's the guy I'm suppose to be with when I get married. But my going away to college has been hard on both of us and in some ways harder on him. I understand that he's back home and doing the same things he's done for 3 years so he doesn't have as many things to keep his mind of missing me as I do but before we never argued and now he's always mad at me about something. He makes me feel awful when I go out and I know he doesn't mean to but it happens. He can't understand where I'm coming from. The guy I dated never cried every night and now he does and it gets depressing and makes me feel guilty. I want to have fun here without knowing that he's at home mad or crying. He's not the crying type of guy so I just don't understand. I love him more than anything and he should realize that, that is all that matters. No other guy here will ever take his place but that doesn't mean that I won't make other guy friends and go out with them. I don't even look at guys the same way because of Brent. My life here does not mean that what I feel in my heart is suddenly going to change. I just wish that he would go back to being the same Brent as before I left but I know that it is going to take time and I just need to realize this just as much as he needs to realize how bad he's making me feel. It's a compromise situation but I think everyone should have to go through this because if we're still together in the long run I know our relationship will be just that much stronger. I'm going home this weekend and I can't wait finally I can show Brent that my feelings for him are the same and I get to see my mom and sister. I have to go to my dad's and since he just moved out a few weeks ago it will be my first time to go and I'm not really looking forward to it. I want things to go back to normal with my family. The way it's suppose to be. If there is such a thing. The months before coming to college were so hard and stressful that at times I'm glad I'm here and away from all of it. At least I don't have to listen to the screaming and fighting. I wish my mom would try to fight for my dad and like lose weight or something. But she's being stupid. I miss my sister so much and my dog Tinker. My sister and I are so close we might as well be twins so I hate being away from her. "
Tell me about yourself.,"The crotheres computer lab is perhaps one of the worst on campus, but I don't really know since I have been to only three. I'm real glad that I got into the college of communications. Its unfortunate, however, that I can't spell worth anything. Jeez, I hope this writing assignment is not graded on spelling or grammar or any of that sort of nonsense. Why is it oh so hot in here? honestly, every other building on campus is freezing, but in here, I just want to wear beach clothes. I remember when I went to the beach for the first time in my life. It was this past summer. Myrtle Beach. Oh family vacations. I hope my mom and pop are doing ok at home. Since I'm gone they only have each other to yell at. no more marjon for yell fest 2004 at the rostami household. Good people. They just need to get out more. This keyboard kind of sucks too. Some of the keys get suck and it is oh so inconvenient. There we go with the spelling again. In the eighth grade my English teacher once told me that spelling is not a sign of a gifted student. At the end of the year she gave me the award for best student. Yep. English has always been a good one. I hope I make the staff of the daily Texan. They emailed me today and told me that I had to write another column. Can't they tell just how amazing I am from only one column? I guess not. I need to be more creative. Creative like all those communication kids. I'm ONE TOO!!! YAYAYAY! Yes sir, all the cool kids are communications majors. AT orientation a radio station person told me I was a cool kid. This city makes my face break out big time. My skin is horrible, and I hate having to scratch  my skin when my fingers have been typing and I most obviously have contracted all sorts of bacteria that I am now rubbing on my face. OH my face. The communications kids I interviewed with today (the Texan) had bad skin too. I think I'll fit in swell with them. If I just get in. OH man oh man oh manoh man. I really hope I make the staff. I find out on Thursday. I also have to submit another column by Thursday. I had a teacher once who had really long nasty nails and a nose ring (those weren't common until a few years ago. then everyone started getting them, including white kids. I am white. My people are from the caucus mountains and you just don't get any more caucasion than and Iranian. again with the spelling. and again with the messed up keys. I should have just gone to use the computers in the ugl or the cma or cmc, whichever one has computers. I thought not having a computer would be a major hassle, but it is pretty decent so far. knock on wood! My hands are dry. That's another think about this city, it makes my skin dry. Maybe that's why my skin is breaking out so hardcore-because it is so dry that it is producing more oils to balance out my skin tone but it just proves to be detrimental to my skin. Oh shoot. I never cared about my appearance. I was the homecoming queen. Me. not some ""popular slut. "" Man, there are so many sorority girls in this school. At the beginning of school I mistakenly walked through the area in front of the ugl and walked through a mass of girls who all looked the exact same!! WHERE IS YOUR IDENTITY LITTLE GIRL? they have none. My phone just vibrated. It could be my mom. she calls a lot now that my sister and I are out of the house all she has to talk to is my pop, and well, he is not one to talk. LAME. Or it could be some fool from my high school warning me of the fat pagan. I hate her, if it is one person who I hate it is jenny pagan: my theatre teacher for 4 years and I had her twice a day. YUCK! Jesus I hate her. I'm going back home on the 24th to crown the new queen and I might have to see her and a whole lot of people I don't want to see for the rest of my life. Including Steven, the king. My ex best friend, and my ex boy friend. (again with the spelling, I do realize all that is one word, but I am hesitant to go back an change it because I am at 18 minutes and 7 seconds right now. I love this kind of writing, we should do it all the time, always. Landon used to always say that. A good man, that Landon Phillips. Too bad some girl named Roxy had to go and taint such a good man. I had a lot of friends who were boys in high school, but not in college. Maybe that is because I live in Littlefield. Ladybugs! oh man, I like to steal the doormat and put it in front of other peoples doors. ha jokes on you "
Tell me about yourself.,"Yesterday, I went tubing with my family on the Guadalupe river. It was a blast!  It was the first time since I moved to college on Ague. 20th that I have spent time with my mom and sister. They are the two people that I miss the most back home and I was so happy and relaxed to get to spend time with them. I also got to see my little baby puppy bichon frise named Bebe who is absolutely spoiled rotten. It was weird going home and sleeping in my own bed for a night but it was also a great get away from school to just hang out with my family. I guess that I have been putting off any kind of homesickness by staying busy with school and trying to meet as many people as possible. I find that the more that I see my family the more I think about them and get sad so. I am refraining from going home for just that reason. I am waiting to find out if I am going to get an interview from the Texas Spirits and I have mixed feelings on whether or not I want to join. Part of my doesn't want to be joining an organization I am not 100% interested just because I am looking to meet some new cool people, but on the other hand I need to get involved in something at UT so that I can find so sense of belonging in this large school. I definitely am worried that if I get busy with an organization I would overstress about my classes and meeting the clubs requirements as a member. Deep down I know that most of my worries are pretty trivial compared to most peoples problems. I know that I am  very lucky just to get the chance to go to college and that is why I am so concerned on whether or not I am going to blow it. I am very concerned about my Chemistry class and I  have been thinking about how much I need to study all weekend. . Well, two classes ago we discussed on a scale from 1-10, what is your fear of death. My feels like it is 20. This is not because I lack a faith that their is a higher being or an after life, it is because I am afraid of losing someone I care about while I am away at school. I have been thinking a lot about a friend of mine who was going to be a sophomore at UT this year who passes away suddenly from a pulmonary embolism/clot. I am now grieving the loss of someone so young and so beautiful that I feel that my sense of security has been ripped away from me. I am now thinking if someone so healthy and young can lose their life so suddenly, whose to say that the couldn't be my brother/sister or mother/father. I guess that you could say that I am one of those people who worry to much and I worry that I will lose someone again and I wouldn't have had the chance to say goodbye. Anyways, this all sounds so childish and ""heavy"" for an 18 year old college student to be thinking about. Well I am so happy that these 20 min. have flown by and I can get to my real homework. It really felt go to get all of my thoughts out in a way that was quick and easy. I hope that I can get all of my work done tonight so that I don't get behind this week. This was a great assignment, I would not mind doing more of these. Have a great day!   "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well where should I start. First of all this has got to be one of the strangest writing assignments that I have ever had to do. I'm not even sure what to write about. My day started at 6:30 today because I have an 8 o'clock class which is really fun. not as fun as this class but fun non-the-less. then I went to my medical terminology class which could be more fun but its hard to make a class that is based on memorization fun. then I had a break from 10 to 3:30 which would really suck if I didn't have plans. so after my class I went to jester then met up with a friend of mine an signed up for a I'm flag football team. well anyway, I'm not even sure if I'm doing this assignment right because all I am doing is describing what I did today. any way I really enjoyed today's material in class. at first I wasn't sure if I would like the class but now I really believe that it might be my favorite class right now. Considering that I have and extremely hot instructor for my RHE 306 class. Its crazy hot attractive she is. But now I'm thinking about another girl that I have a crush on. Today she invited me over to her apartment to have some burgers with her and her roommates. I'm not sure if she knows how I feel, but I'm having a hard time reading her. Usually I'm pretty good about being able to tell if a girl is feeling me but she seems to be different which doesn't make things any easier. I also got to talk to my roommates about things that had been on my mind which was refreshing because I had been wanting to talk to them for a while. Things seem to be really good between us which isn't too surprising because we're all pretty decent guys, though one does tend to get to us sometimes. I am going blank right now but hopefully something will come to mind. On yeah, I got to talk to my parents today which wasn't too bad. My dad didn't say much because he had football practice but he said that the team was coming around which is always good to hear because he puts a lot of effort and time into his work. My mom called on her way to a Bible study and said that she would be sending a few things with the girl I have crush on this weekend since she is going home Friday. anyway crush is such a high school word now, what I really meant was girl I'm attracted to. What's really funny is that this is the girl that my mom has been wanting me to get with since I was in 10th grade. and every time she would tell me I would brush it off knowing that the girl was attracted to me but now that I'm into her it kind of sucks because now I have to put much more effort into it. Now don't get me wrong, because I'm not trying to make it seem like I'm am lazy but I truly am not used to putting in so much work. I know it may sound cockeye but if it does I'm sorry, please don't think of me like that. what's even funnier is that who ever reads this may not even get to meet more or me meet them but any way its been about twenty minutes so we'll talk later, or I'll type and you'll read later. "
Tell me about yourself.,"OK, so I'm sick and I don't feel good. But I feel better than yesterday and last night. I woke up about a million times last night feeling horrible and my temperature just kept climbing. I finally took some Tylenol at about 4am this morning and I woke up later sweating, so I hope that means I broke the fever. Now I just have this stupid cough to worry about. I hate coughing because it hurts my throat. I need to call my voice teacher and tell her I can't come to lessons today because I'm sick. Which sucks because I haven't had a lesson in forever. And she's the best teacher I've ever had. I guess keeping the extra money is good. Ugh. I'm coughing again. It sucks. My dog is looking out the window. I have a lot of studying that I need to do today. I need to catch up on a bunch of stuff so that I hopefully can go to Dallas tomorrow to see Sister Hazel in concert again. But I seriously don't know if I'll be able to go since I'm sick. I'm on medicine, so hopefully getting another round in me today will help. Goodness this stupid clock is going so slow. I've only been typing for 4 minutes. I think 20 minutes is a bit excessive. There's not even a pause button. What is I have to go to the bathroom or someone comes to the door. Seriously. Plus, I want to lay down. I want to get something to eat and take my medicine. I need to call my voice teacher. So, I want to go to Dallas this weekend but I also want to stay to go to some stuff that's going on down here. Mostly because the guy I have a crush on will be there too. And he's been giving me very mixed signals lately. Which is so frustrating. I don't know what to think or how to act around him. I'm trying to act almost aloof, as if I don't care. Part of me thinks he's just toying with me to stoke his own ego. And I refuse to play into anyone's ego. I don't want to get hurt. It sucks. And this cooler weather is reminding me of couples. Being able to snuggle and all that. Not that I've ever had that. I'm 22 and I've never had a boyfriend. Which is OK. I don't define my self worth by a guy or if I've had a boyfriend or not. But sometimes I do think it world be nice. But it's whatever God has planned for me. If He thinks I'm not ready, then I'm not ready. I need to start spending more time with God. Just get my focus back on Him. So many things have happened these past few weeks and I feel that they've all been for a reason. And I'm graduating in December and I have no idea what I'm going to do. I'm excited and terrified at the same time. Will I get a job?  Where will it be?  Will I like it?  Will I actually get to end up doing what I want to do?  Why am I so scared to put myself out there sometimes?  The worst that can be said to me is no. There are always other options. If you want something, you've got to spend that time and effort it takes to make it happen. So I just called to cancel my voice lessons and my voice teacher is going to charge me for this week anyways because its a ""late cancellation. ""  Well, I know that, but it's not like I knew I was going to be running a fever. I mean, seriously. Have a little compassion. And my stupid thermometer just ran out of batteries. So now I can't even take my temp anymore. Guess that means I'll be making a Wal-Mart run later today. I need to get some more Vicks Vapor rub anyways. I hate being sick. I've always thought of myself as a singer and singers can't sing when they're sick. OK, only a minute and a half left. I can do this. I can get through it. If my cough doesn't kill me first. Blue skies, shining on me, nothing but blue skies do I see!  My dog is barking at something. She's loud and it's annoying. I need a drink of water. I want to be well. I need to study. I need to do a bible study. YES!  I'm done!  That's all, folks!  BYE!!!!!!!! "
Tell me about yourself.,"So yesterday my boyfriend from A&M came down to Austin to celebrate our 9 month anniversary. It was a lot of fun but I stayed up late so I'm pretty tired. I hate that feeling of no energy and I just want to sleep but I know I can't because I am so stressed out. I am still really adjusting to college life. It's is so different from high school and its not all that it's worked up to be. I really like all the freedom, along with everyone else, but I am finding out that its hard to keep up on my studying. I am only taking 14 hrs. , which is supposedly and easy load, but I feel so bogged down. I tell myself I am go into catch up on the weekend and it never happens because other things come up. I have so much I want to do but there are not enough hours in the day. But everyone says this is what a lot of college students feel like and it will take time for me to adjust. I just don't hope it will reflect in my grades. I thought I had a calculus test next Friday, but I came to find out today that it is nest Wednesday. That is really scary. Bit I took calculus my senior year in high school so I feel I know some of the stuff. Everyone studies hardcore for tests, which I am pretty nervous about. I don't really do to much homework in that class because I have so much to do in my other classes. I really hope I'm doing the right thing on this paper and that every other student doesn't type super fast so my paper looks really short and that I didn't try. Anyways, I have a problem with the nest football game which is TX vs. Rice. I didn't realize they sold the tickets so early. I guess the draw started yesterday. I want to go but I haven't really met a lot of close friends to go with. This guy friend from high school wants me to go but I really want to go with a big group of people. I have never been to a large football game. Actually the only games I have gone to have been my high school games. But my high school had like 3,000 people so it was a big school. A lot of the seniors from our school went to A&M because it's only an hour away. I don't know why they would want to go and pass up living in the city like this. I am originally from California, which was so pretty, and Houston isn't the prettiest place in the world. I forgot so sign off instant messenger and people are trying to talk to me. It is getting really annoying. Seems like that is a such a popular way to communicate with people now. I like it but some people are obsessed with it. But I guess I am obsessed with my cell phone. I don't even use any other phone. I am always on it. I think it is so funny when you walk to class and everyone is on  their cells. I feel like I have to take mine to and call someone so of course I do. Plus, walking to class gets kind of lonely. I feel like these thoughts pop in my head and I then I go in a tangent to try to type. But then my mind goes blank for a second. I never really thought I was a good writer. In fact, I thought I was horrible. My teachers never gave me feedback and I never felt comfortable sharing my papers in class. It wasn't until the end of my senior year, my English teacher told the whole class that I was one of the best writers in the class. I really thank her for that because that really boosted my confidence and I feel like I do write well. It almost makes me look forward to writing instead of procrastinating like I do everything else. My critical thinking teacher said that is the number one regret for students after their first semester. I believe him because it is so hard not to procrastinate. I try not to since it's such a bad thing, but I guess it's just human nature. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Wow, I have some pizza stuck in my tooth. Aw, why did that song have to end, it was good. the AC is really loud. Man, I like shrek 2. tonight, I'm breaking the habit tonight, I like Kelly Clarkson, she's so talented. man, I'm so bad at spelling. I haven't heard this, oh, yeah, it's by clay aiken, or maybe it isn't. Oh well. Ozarka Natural Spring. It was probably from Fort Worth, I'm from Denton about thirty miles north of Dallas. I saw Jenny a couple days ago. She's got curly hair. Movie Night, um I don't know. I'm supposed to by typing what I am thinking. I'm talking with Victoria my roommate. She is wearing a hat. I have a hat just like it. It's in my closet on top on a shelf. Victoria is leaving now. I shall say bye to her. Ok, now that that is over. I am going out to lunch with this girl from Christians on Campus. Sounds like it would be fun. Her name is Joselyn and she just graduated, I think from this college in Boston but she is here for just the semester. Only 4 minutes have gone by. Wow, this is taking forever. I have chemistry oops, mistake. I don't like commercials on the radio, why couldn't they just play music commercial free. My folder is blue. I finished all my psychology reading (all of chapter three). I learned way too much info on the nervous system. It is going to take forever to study for the test. I'm glad there is a lot of info in the chapter though, because I'm going to med school and will need that info. I keep making typos probably because I'm typing too fast. Oh, I have ice-cream in the freezer. Mmmm. It is a blue bell ice cream sandwich. I like Wendy's. Ah, yay, another commercial free hour of music. YAY. I like Avril Lavigne. My Happy Ending is a good song. Everyone criticizes her for not being ""punk enough. ""  I laugh at how much time people spend criticizing artists. They should just appreciate the music. I think by saying that I was being a hypocrite because I was criticizing the people who criticize. Does admitting that you are a hypocrite make you a hypocrite. Deep, huh?  I'm wearing contacts. I like my sunglasses. They are on top of my head because it is pointless to wear contacts indoors. Wow, I am only have way done. Hey, maybe that means I'm optimistic. I am such a bad speller. I spend way to much time thinking about school. I'm such a nerd. Everyone else goes out and parties and I stay in the dorm and study for hours and hours. But I do tend to watch a lot of TV, wait, I haven't been watching much TV during this past week at UT. Only about 1 hour per day. I'm so proud of myself. I can't believe that I haven't procrastinated this assignment. I don't like this trend of girls wearing too short skirts. I guess I'm just too conservative and wear long jeans or caprice. I bought new caprice. My mom just washed them. I went to the B. E. S. T. thing sponsored by the business school. It was so much fun. We went to the lake. Hello, Jenny wrote me a note. My printer is off. I can't think of anything else to write about. I was valedictorian, I was nervous when I said my speech. YAY for 5. 0 GPA. For having such a high GPA, you would think that I wouldn't be so scatterbrained. I think it is just because it will take me a little while to get used to the whole college experience thing. I have to sign up to do that psychology experiment. I want to do the prescreening. Victoria says that it takes two hours. I want to get it over with and not procrastinate. I have that awful habit and am trying to get rid of it. I like this song, and that song, well, maybe not. I want to go so sleep. I went to sleep early last night 9:30. Oh, this is that singer Chad Kroger (I am such a bad speller). I liked Spiderman 2. I have always been a fan of stuff like that: Spiderman, Batman, Superman, etc. I like Smallville on the WB. It is a good show. What else. I can't think of anything else. Ok, I have about 3 and a half minutes left. What else should I do. I have chemistry in an hour but I should leave in 1/2 an hour because I want to get a good seat in class. I'm so blind, even with my contacts. I don't want to sit in the very front row because then I will strain my neck having to look straight up at the Professor. I have Professor Laude. He is very funny. I went to a discussion session at 11. Wait, it was at 10 and ended at 11AM. I think is was fairly productive. I'm a business major. Did I mention that. I'm also pre-med. I want to be an pediatric ophthalmologist. That is just a fancy term for a kid eye doctor. It will be able to be cool to say that though. My mom was a doctor. My dad has a PhD, so he is in a sense a doctor. He is asst. Dean of the Business School at UNT. I like this song. It is by Maroon 5. Nigel, my older brother, he is 23, I think, likes this song. He has this CD and will never let me borrow it. He called me last night and was  "
Tell me about yourself.,"Today has been a terrible day here in San Antonio, because it is all ugly and humid outside. I am really glad that I came down this labor day weekend to see the family. My uncle is very mean he needs to be a bit more nice to me. He always makes fun of me ant telling me that I need to stay up in Austin and that I can't come down for the homecoming football game. I need to move to another room where the air conditioner is not so loud. I need time to think and be alone. My sister really needs to turn the volume on the TV down while I still do my homework. It is not fair that I am a very considerate person and then there are people who aren't towards me. Right now I am listening to my country music while I am typing. I find that country music soothes me and it very easy to understand. This always runs through my head: Why does this Hispanic girl listen to country? I feel that this is what runs through peoples minds, it runs through my sisters mind, she likes to listen to rap, R&B, and ""party music"",  and I never ask her why she likes that type of music. I don't mind that music either, but I prefer my country. Another thought that crosses my mind is: how come this girl doesn't listen to tejano music? I ask myself if I am adopted in the family, because it takes me awhile to get something's, I have this hyper personality, and I have an ""Irish persons'"" chin. I am smelling the fresh grapes that have just placed in front of my face. I have a bad habit of smelling things. I also have a bad habit of constantly washing my hands or using antibacterial hand sanitizer. I think that I am obsessive compulsive in something's. I always feel the need to be clean, and being organized. It is quite funny how as I get older I need to be clean, but when I was younger, I didn't care if I got dirty, or if I didn't take a bath; I hated taking baths. I am noticing that the time is running out on me and that I doesn't feel like it has been 20 minutes, it seems a lot faster. I thought that UT was going to be a SUPER SCARY school, but it isn't because I have awesome classes and the environment here is awesome, everyone here is friendly. I  "
Tell me about yourself.,"I just woke up a little bit ago and decided to go ahead and get this done. I tried to sit down yesterday and do all my homework but when I got an offer to go shopping, I just couldn't resist. My boyfriend's sister was in town and every time I go to Houston, she is really sweet with me and takes me out so I couldn't just let her sit at the apartment. We went to the Arboretum and looked around. Honestly, I don't have any money to be spending right now so I didn't buy anything but as soon as my check comes in, there are a few things that I have in mind. This whole not working thing is really different for me. For the past 4 years I've always been working and able to by my own stuff. But now, my parents decided that school is more important and I should take 15 hours and just not work. So at first the idea sounded really great but the more time passes the more I realize it's not going to work out. My parents are giving me living money to go out to eat and to the movies and stuff but on top of that they pay for my apartment, all the bills, and school. There's no way I would ever ask for more money, the money that I need for my friends and sisters birthday, plus my boyfriends birthday and Christmas. Carlos' b-day is Dec. 12 which is not too far away from Christmas, so I wanted to sort of combine his presents. In January some of my best friends and I always go skiing and this year it's going to be a bunch of us with our boyfriends!! So I was going to pay for half of Carlos' skiing trip as his Christmas present. But now that my parents pay for everything for me, I can't ask them to send me on this trip plus another half of the cost for Carlos, I would just feel weird asking. So I plan to tomorrow afternoon, after I get done with class, to go and apply to a few places here around Far West. I really just want a few hours a week, something for a little extra money. Hopefully I could work in a coffee shop, that would be ideal. I thought about Starbucks which is literally 1 minute from my front door but what I'm afraid of is that they'll give me the early (like 5am) shift. There is now way I can handle that on a Friday or Saturday morning. So we'll see, hopefully I get something soon. Ok well now what do I write? I have 5 more minutes left. oh some good news. My dad called me last night and gave me the great news that he won Incubus tickets!! My dad is so amazing when it comes to wining things on the radio. He's won a car, trips to Cancun, London, Arizona, Seattle, New Mexico (all paid for trips of course), probably 100 tickets to Six Flags and Sea World separately, and so many concert tickets you wouldn't believe it. He's just really good and always has about 4 radios going at the same time, all on different stations. Ok well I just realized that I only have 1 minute left so I guess I'll wrap things up. I do wan to say that I liked this assignment very much and that we should do all of the. bye.      "
Tell me about yourself.,"As I am writing this, the Red Sox are playing the A's. I think this really may be  the year for the Sox. I hope so because how cool would it be to see the ""Curse of  the Bambino"" broken. Their lineup is killer this year, and they are finally playing  the game the way it's supposed to be played: defense and pitching. They look like  the 1996-2001 Yankees. I'm ready for a World Championship for my Sox. I just read an email from home, from my Dad. I miss him, just having someone  around to talk to. I guess I am really lucky to have the kind of bond with my dad  that I do, most guys don't. I mean, not many people have  the kind of Dad who  taught them how to play sports and things like that, but I have vivid memories of  being 8 and 9 years old and my Dad throwing me passes in the parking lot at the  ferry. With football season starting, I really realize how much I miss the game. I mean,  it's been 6 years since I DIDN'T play football during the fall, and it is kind of hitting  hard. I miss putting on the pads, taking the hits, the excitement of Friday Nights,  being the Captain. I miss D a lot too. we had such a crazy fall last year, always  know that we should be together but never being able to get it right. I miss 8th  periods with her, driving around in my jeep and talking. I miss Saturdays, the days  after games hanging out and eating hoagies, watching football with Micah. I've  been gone 3 weeks, and I'm not homesick, I'm just kind of missing the Crew. I miss  Meghan a lot. For 4 years, she's been one of the biggest things in my life, and I  really think she is finally being able to grasp the fact that I am one of the biggest  things in her life too. Which is good, because I really cannot see either of us  drifting away from the other. I hope Andrew is doing ok. I'm sure he is, such a small school is good for him. He  really craves that small environment where he can stand out and garner attention  for being the ""Big Guy"", the built guy. a school like this would be terrible for his  self-esteem. But oh well, whatever floats your boat, right?  I really hope Micah does ok. that kid has never been in a social group or circle  that I didn't bring him into. He may really struggle with finding his niche at school. I  hope not thought, he's my best friend and I need him to be self-confident and  happy so I can stop worrying about him. I can never really tell if worrying about  people is a good thing or a waste of time. I worry so much about Meghan, with her  mother walking out on her and everything. and Meghan is so reclusive when it  comes to her emotions, even to me. it betrays her every once in a while thought,  when I have a beautiful, crying girl in my arms, and it's almost satisfying to see a  basic human reaction/emotion out of her. I hope D is doing ok. being the only one of US not to go to college has to take it's  toll on her. but from what she says, she is getting her act together. I just couldn't  take seeing one of my best friends throw their life away on such a worthless guy  as Lee. thank God she's finally going in the right direction. Maybe I won't have to  live out that diner scene in my mind and deal with a haggard friend down the road  somewhere. Of course, if it was going to be anyone who did, it would be me. Going away has finally moved people to express themselves, and it really does  making me feel satisfied that I AM having an impact in someone's life. or, a lot of  someone's. I really don't mean that to sound arrogant, it's just that I invest so much  of myself into those people. and I really believe it has paid off. My family seems to being doing well. I'm glad. The girls will be back in school  soon, and next year Maggie will be in my position. That's crazy. Go Sox. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I really miss Desiree. she is my best friend and it hard not being able to talk to her everyday seeing as how I don't have my cell phone here with me. my not so intelligent sister was supposed to send it to me in the mail Saturday, but how much do you want to bet that she didn't send it until Monday and I wont get it until Thursday before I leave to go to Houston. I'm drawing a blank. how am I supposed to write for twenty minutes when I'm struggling to think of something to write after only two. I guess I shouldn't think so hard, should I. is that supposed to be a question mark? anyway. I'm really enjoying this psychology class. I thought that it might have been boring but as luck would have it Pennebaker is actually a really energetic professor. I like that. it almost seems as if he can relate to his students on a deeper level but at the same time he is still able to get his lesson across to us. kind of reminds me of Brink, my science teacher in high school. he has been there for quite some time now and he never ceases to amaze his students with his ability to connect with us. I do not know one person in Cleveland High School or one person who came through CHS and had Brinkley that didn't like him or his approach to teaching. I miss him. I miss high school. college life is really overwhelming at times. Right now I'm pretty much struggling to stay in school and let me tell you that it is not easy. I partied way too hard last semester and it would be a shame for me to go home and have to endure the horrible comments from everyone. Oh nikki couldn't handle that big school. She got the big head and got shot down as soon as she got there. Look at little miss I'm smarter than you back in Cleveland. I guess it was lonely up there on her high horse. I have to be a success and that is why I have buckled down on my studies and reading this semester. it is so important that I become somebody. I can't stress that enough. I refuse to go back home and end up on the same path that the rest of my family has chosen for themselves. its not easy living up to others expectations when you know that you can do it but aren't sure if you know how or if you have the drive to do so. My family is a bunch of nobodies and I hate to say that. Well in an educational sense of the term. None of them went off to school in order to better themselves. but then again I can't really blame them for that. I mean we really don't have the resources required to be true leaders or successes when coming from an educational stance. I'm here on financial aid as it is. its not easy walking in my shoes. some people think I have it so easy but they really have not idea what kind of challenges I had to overcome to get here. it was not an easy road to tow. I been through it all and still have managed to survive only by the grace of God. Speaking of God I miss TJ and Trinity and Tristan. I only wish that I had more time with them before they left. especially TJ. He was and still is my baby. I love him and miss him so much but his psycho parents took him away from me. they could have left but why him. I remember there being a time when he wouldn't even go to them when I first started working in the nursery and how he could only say no. that was my little boy. I love him and miss him like  you would never understand or maybe you would because I'm sure you have kids and even though he wasn't mine I loved him like he was. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Today has seriously been the longest day ever and guess what? It's only the 4th day of classes. that's a horrible thing to think about. I stepped off of the 7th floor elevator at Jester and was once again overcome by that odor of hamster cage. It's awful. I've been on some other floors and it doesn't smell like that. I wonder if it's the carpet or something, but obviously nobody cares enough about it to fix it, so that's cool I guess. I got a sign on my door that says they are going to paint all the doors starting tomorrow. I'm totally sure that its going to smell so much better on this floor after that. yeah right. This oatmeal cream pie is great, I'm so hungry because I haven't eaten all day yet, and all my professors successfully fried my brain. I hate when I don't know everything. well I don't mean everything because nobody knows everything, but more like. I hate when I can't understand something right away, probably because I know that means I have to spend extra time learning it later on and that's never any fun. I swear that when I used to eat these oatmeal cream pies they were bigger, so maybe the manufacturer downsized the product or something. I wouldn't be surprised, or maybe now I'm just so much bigger than the cookie itself, instead of when I used to eat them years ago. Who knows? or actually who cares. Kate just called me and she's not going to eat until later, so guess that means I'm going to the chem. review at 5. It'll probably be really good for me so I shouldn't complain, but complaining is so fun, yet so annoying all at the same time. I can't believe that I'm actually excited about going home this weekend, not for long, but I kind of feel like I'm missing out on so much in San Antonio, even though I'm not. I can't wait to get some good Mexican food. it's been too long. What a horrible affect working at a Mexican restaurant all summer had on me. Oh well. The football game this weekend should be extremely awesome !! I'm so excited, my first UT football games as a STUDENT in the STUDENT section. ha-ha. and actually I think my 3rd or 4th game ever to see, how cool. I saw something on Austin's news talking about ordering the games on PPV. that's crazy. I really hope that doesn't mean that here in town all the games are blacked out and I can't watch them. like the away games for example. That'd be so cool if I could get tickets to the OU game. I hear that there's nothing like it, and I'm sure that's true. but you have to get pretty lucky and then you have to pay 85 bucks. and assuming that you get all that taken care of. you kind of have to make sure you know at least someone else going, meaning that they have to get through that whole process as well, pretty crazy, but I guess if all else fails I can order ir PPV for 40 bucks. yeah right, that game better be on ABC or something. I actually called Kenny today, after my first Biology class. he didn't answer, hopefully it was because he was in class. I don't know why but for some reason I really feel like he doesn't like me the way he did before I went down to San Antonio this past weekend. it's cool I guess. since I'm here and he's there, but I don't know. I wish that we wouldn't of met, so that I wouldn't have to deal with it. But then again I don't wish that because he's a cool guy. so much like me though, it's kind of scary. I wish that I could be the only one playing games and he would just profess his like for me everyday, but then again. if he did that I wouldn't like him, since it's all about the chase. crazy how those things work out. he's been exceptionally mean though. well just yesterday, but like he says it's his way of flirting, but ha-ha whatever. I like that boy. dang I just admitted it. I don't like him actually. I just don't know. I definitely don't think we're each others types though. he belongs around a much more rowdy ""Karla"" type and he might just be a little too crazy for me. Sounds like a challenge. I'm pretty hungry for like some real food, I guess I'll go down to JCL in a little bit and find something, that cinnamon toast crunch and oatmeal cream pie just didn't do it for me. and I'm exceptionally tired too. I ended up being 5 minutes late to my calculus discussion this morning, and I don't think it even helped me that much since I barely got a B on the homework. Man, I miss high school math classes. Everything was definitely explained SO much better, so yeah needless to say I'm pretty freaked out about that, I'm actually freaked out about all my classes. Oh well. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am worried about my brother, Bobby, right now. My mother just called me and told me he was in a bad car accident and was taken to the ER. She said he is okay, but they are stitching him up right now. Tonight I went to church with my best friend, Amanda. We sang a lot, which I love. I'm not necessarily the best singer, but I really enjoy it. All the songs we sang tonight, I knew from my church at home in Plano. That made me happy. I also signed up for teams at church. Right now I am a little frustrated though because Amanda and I are trying to do our Art History homework, but the website won't let me download the article I need. Very Frustrating!!!  Oh, I need to go wash my dishes when I'm done with this. Amanda and I made chili-cheese dogs. They were great!!  My roommate, Sijia, is not home yet, and this worries me because it is pretty late, and she shouldn't be walking around Austin alone in the dark. I have to write a paper for my freshman seminar class for Friday on two pieces of music that I have not been able to listen to yet, which frustrates me. I just found out about the assignment today. School is going well though, a little stressing, but all around, it is going well. All day I listened to one of the best songs I have heard in a long time called ""How Could I"". The music in this song is very well played, and the lyrics are really good (sad though), and the lead singer (of oleander)'s voice is very soft and pretty. I have to do a geology assignment for my discussion section tomorrow which is a little stressing because the article for the paper I have to write is about 20 pages long. I didn't get much sleep last night because I was trying to read for Art History because I don't learn anything in that class because it does not interest me at all. I woke up early this morning to look over my math homework. I won't get much sleep tonight either. Amanda has music playing in the background right now, but I don't know who is singing. I like the way it sounds though. Tonight I taught Amanda how to tap dance. It was interesting. we went into my bathroom (because it's really big and has a good floor for tapping) and I taught her a few basics. She and I have both danced our entire lives, but she has never taken tap, so I am going to teach her. She is going to teach me pointe, because I haven't done ballet in three years. I have a bad knee, and last summer I had knee surgery, so I haven't been able to do very many classes the last few years. I only took tap and jazz. I miss ballet though. Since I've moved to Austin, I've really missed dance because I don't have a dance studio here. I would like to go take some classes, but I think it would be better to concentrate on school, at least the first semester, and I can just practice at home. I bought new pointe shoes the other day. We had to walk many many miles to get them. Today in geology class, we played football and sang the UT fight song standing up with the ""hook 'them"" sign in the air. It was a very interesting class. right now I wonder if anyone has IMed me on AIM. I'm really tired, but I won't be able to sleep tonight because I need to do school work. My parents might go to the Bahamas in a few weeks, hopefully I may go as well. I haven't been to a beach in two summers now because of the knee surgery and rehab (for the knee), and this summer we were just too busy. That reminds me, I miss my family in Virginia. Maybe I can fly out there this summer. That would be fun. Virginia is beautiful. The Chesapeake area especially. I'm glad my brother is alright, but when my mother called it worried me. But he will be fine. I cleaned the guest bathroom tonight (I have to do chores around the house because I live in a co-op). Tomorrow I think I'm going to sleep in between classes. I only have two discussion sections. Sijia just got home!!  "
Tell me about yourself.,"o. k, so now I'm writing for this assignment. I'm going to turn off the music I'm listening to. ok, all finished with that. it was bizarre love triangle by new order, I like new order. I like order in general. reminds me of the balance between chaos and order. I'm probably more into that than most people I know. I wonder if most people think about chaos and order. the fan above me feels good, generating wind. my neck has been hurting a little today because last night I ate it hard on the ground while riding my bike at night. I totally busted my ass. my foot slipped which made me lose my balance and I crashed sideways with bike still in between me. gave me a few bad strawberries and I hit my head pretty damn hard. for a split second my world was ""bamn"" and multicolor. my front door opened, it was my mom probably watering the plants. this makes me comment on the fact that I still live at home, I still live at home. I'm nineteen though so it isn't a huge deal but I'd like to have my own place. but I don't have the money for that because I pay for my own tuition and books and expenses. that sucks. but I do feel good when I say that to other people, usually at work is when I do that. I work at a restaurant that also makes espresso drinks, it's called satellite cafe. I got promoted and got more hours making it feasible that I could work through college and not have to worry about loans. loans blow. there's the door again. I keep looking at the finish button right underneath this never disappearing text. seven min, six seconds. my dad just walked in and we had a ""how are you"" exchange. things are going better with my parents and I. there was a time before ut,(I'm a transfer from acc)where I didn't really care much about things. probably because I wasn't being challenged, except from work which I enjoyed/enjoy. anyway, I was in with what the counterculture does when the norm of society isn't watching or around. the popular bob Marley type stuff. I have a need to use code, with this being a college assignment and all. although I wonder about the likelihood of this being read by someone that shouldn't, it's probably close to zero. I stopped writing to notice the spaces in between rows of words which goes diagonally from top left to top right. how interesting. internet, seven thirty seven pm. I wish I was done now. funny because I was looking forward to doing this, but I thought it would be more of a stop/start thought process. it seems like I'm just narrating my last couple of days. I was just rearranging myself to get more comfortable. and I am somewhat. wish I had my own place, privacy. being alone is nice at times. hmm, I have to write for an entire twenty minutes. I wonder if people that are slow at typing have a hard time with this. my face is all rough and ""treated"". I have avg acne, not really the worst I've had. I am using treatment though which helps. my mom just went into the laundry room which I assumed meant she would go right across the hallway into my room and make a comment about it not being clean. because I told her that I would clean it last night because I went on a bike ride instead. in a few aspects that bike ride was a waste of time. but for some reason I like wasting time. there she goes back into the laundry room. and no comment, but no inspection either. I have a good view from the office room where I am typing this twenty minute thing. itching my eye felt good. my right arm is getting annoyed at it's position. now that I noticed that, I noticed I'm sore a bit all over my body, which made me think of going to Gregory gym and how I can't really yet because I am a gimp. Not really though, I could easily tough it out, I'm competitive and athletic, or use to be. sucks not being a true youth, in high school where you can dick around for four years. I knew I'd miss high school for that reason. I like when I repeat words and they are on two lines above and below each other, like when I typed the words high school and they are repeated in appearance. I was so rudely interrupted by (a) the phone line for my dad ringing and (b) the twenty minute marker, which came faster than I had expected in the end. ok, that was interesting, something I don't really want to do again, or do I? it was nice to get stuff out in writing, or typing. ok, finished. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I keep thinking about this White Stripes song and I cannot remember the name of it so I can download it. It continues to anger me. Its really dark in here so I should open the blinds, but I think right now there is a glare through a window and that would  not be good since my computer faces it. Just a minute ago my keyboard was making me really mad. It would freeze up and I couldn't type certain letters. It made me so mad. I wonder what Ben is doing right now. He wasn't online but I know he doesn't have to work today so I am curious what he is doing. I called him earlier today and then when I got out of school. I really miss him and I am glad I get to go home next Friday. I also miss my dog, Rosie. I wonder if she thinks about me or maybe thinks I am dead or something. Mom said she looked for me a little bit. I can't believe my credit card got denied. That makes me so mad since Mom sent the check like a week and a half ago. I wonder if I can get on the website and look at my balance. Dad is such a cheap guy. I can't believe that he thinks I can live on $250 a month. I guess I could but that would mean I couldn't buy everything I want and since Mom isn't here to take me shopping and buy stuff for me, I have to buy it for myself. I just got back from Walgreens and I am also getting really mad  because my car is really dirtier every time I get in it. There is bird crap all over it since it is under that tree. I kind of like the spot and the shade, just not the crap. I wonder when I will start to feel better. I need to take that medicine. I can't stop coughing now and I couldn't in class either. I bet it made the people around me hate me. It feels weird to have already eaten dinner at 6:30. It kind of sucks that they serve it from 5 to 6:30 because I am used to it at like 7:30. The food here is not all that great but there is a better variety than Mom makes. I am so excited about going home next weekend and sleeping in my double bed. It is really hard to get used to sleeping in a twin when I usually sprawl out all over the double. My bed also has that poofy thing that needs to flatten out because it makes it harder to sleep. Bennett borrowed one of my scarves today and that also made me mad. I don't mind that she borrowed it but I really wished she would have asked first. Some of her clothes are really ugly I think. I don't know I guess that is what you get coming from Podunk, TX. I like her a lot but I just feel like she thinks she is hot stuff and it also pisses me off that she rushed and I didn't. I really would like to know how someone like her was accepted and I wasn't. I'm not saying that she is gross or anything. I just think that I should have gotten into a good one also. It makes me mad and disappointed and upset all at the same time simply because I always pictured myself being in a sorority and I never expected rush to go that way at all. It kind of hurts even worse since everyone on my hall has all of the decorations and all of that stuff. Claire also made me mad last night when she started eating all of my goldfish and stuff. I have so much homework to do and all I want to do is go to sleep. I feel awful because my nose is running and my throat and ears hurt, plus I keep coughing. I wonder if it is just allergies or if I actually have a cold. Mom said she would make an appointment with Dr. Eldredge when I go home so that he can see me if I need him to. I really like him a lot more than Dr. Audrey because he isn't psycho and he is really young. That makes me think of Paschal and Fort Worth because his office is down that way. Man I really want to go to Ol South. I really am kind of homesick. I have been trying not to think about it because it makes me really sad. I think I miss Rosie and Mom the most. I miss Ben but I am beginning to think that we are not right for each other. The other night when we went to those frat parties I was thinking that I don't know if I can do it or not. I am not sure whether I am missing him or missing the attention and also I know that we are not really in love and I don't see myself loving him. I really miss what Eric and I had and I think that is really the only relationship that I have been in where I was in love. I think Eric is mad at me because I called him the other day and he never called me back. I wonder if things would have ended up differently if he had gone to school or even had a better career path than he does. I really miss him but I don't think I could do the long distance thing with him any better. Plus, I know there were things wrong with him too. I really wish I could combine the traits of both people I like and make a boyfriend specified to my desires. I bet everyone does. I can't believe how tired I am. I wish I could just go to bed right now. Maybe I will take some Tylenol PM. Although that didn't help me at all last night. Everyone is gone to their sorority meetings now so I think I am the only one here. Oh well that's okay I will get a lot done. There were these guys in class today that  "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am beginning to think I am committing to too many activities. I want to be involved, but maybe I am doing too much-   I wish I did not have eight o'clock class on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I hate having to get up early-   I need to buy my Chemistry book and Biology book still. Books are so expensive-oh well-   I am excited for the football game this weekend!  It will be nice to have Monday off-   It smells like Lucky Charms-probably because I just ate some-   I need to get a transcript request from quad C to transfer my chem class from this summer to here-   I need to go by TOPS pics to look at pics from the other night-   I need to call my camper back-   I should do some reading for my classes tomorrow-   I am excited to do the SHINE program for the nursing school. I wonder who my professor that I get to help out will be. I need to look up hospital info online so I can decide where and when to volunteer this semester-   The people who live above me constantly make loud noises- are they obese people or just loud stomping walkers?-   I can't decide if I want to get my nutrition book- the teacher does not require it-but it may be beneficial-   I need to get some more picture frames for my room- I love pictures-   I am excited about a new skirt I bought today-wow I really got a good deal on it-   I like shopping too much-ever since I have been in college I feel like it has become an addiction-from school supplies to clothes-   I love how random my thoughts are right now-   I need to talk to my parents about sorority stuff and my credit card- that was a bummer when I got denied today at the coop-I should have just used my other card-oh well-   I can't decide if I want to go to the ranch this weekend-it seems pointless to go but then again it is only an hour away-hmmm   I want to download some ringtones after this-   I can't believe it's almost September- wow the summer flew by-pretty soon it will be Christmas-   I love hanging out with Katy-she is so sweet-   I can't wait to go to the rodeo sometime this year-   My neck has been itching lately in a random spot- I wonder why-   It would be fun to go on a random date-I wonder who will be first-Brandon or myself-hopefully myself-I need to be able to move on, but yet with a friend-   It's going to be kind of random meeting up with Kelsey tomorrow-gosh and she wants to sit with us-of course Court is already busy-I bet that is the only reason she has called- I hate when girls do that-girls need to learn time management with friends and guys too!     I want to lay out by the pool tomorrow-hopefully it will be nice and sunny -         "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm a little worried these past few days because of the work study award. I know that I have a certain time limit to get a job and I'm trying to get a job but it's so hard. It's even harder when you've never had a job experience before. And my older sister keeps pestering me about getting a job. I know what I need to do, she just needs to lay off of me sometimes. That's one of the bad things about sharing a dorm room with a sister, she'll be able to spy on you and tell on our parents what's going on in my life. It's not always bad because I don't do anything that will disappoint my parents. The other thing that makes me a little mad is just because she is older than me, she can boss me around. It's not like I'm her slave or anything; it's just that I don't like the feeling of being told what to do and when to do it. I like being my own person, making my own decisions. If only I had been able to do that since I was a kid so I wouldn't have so much problems now. Ever since I could remember, my parents have always wanted me to become a doctor. Any doctor is ok as long as I made it. Well, what they want has followed me into my college life. The only reason why I would want to become a doctor is because my parents insist on me being one. So now I don't really know what I want to major in. I had never been given the chance to really consider my career because it has always been what my parents want. I'm just so obedient. I don't know why but I'm just like Ella in Ella Enchanted. Always obeying what others says. So, my college life has been ok so far. I like the campus a lot and I also like Jester because it's in the center of everything that I need. The PCL is across the street, and the gym is adjacent to it also. The food is right down on the 2nd floor of Jester or downstairs at JCL. Very convenient. The only bad thing about it so far is that I have a TV and that means trouble. I have become addicted to the show Three's Company. I have to watch it everyday. Let's see. It comes on ch. 40 at 10-11pm, ch. 41 at 12-12:30am, ch. 49 at 1-2am. So I stay up late just to watch my Three's Company. I know it's very silly especially since on Monday's, Wednesday's, and Friday's I have a 8am class. But somehow I manage to get up and not feel tired at all. Amazing isn't it?  But it probably will wear off soon. Another thing I have to mention, I am getting very tired of eating American food for every meal, I need something from my culture. I need my rice!  So, I had a very wonderful Labor Day Weekend because I went to Houston to visit my new baby cousin, Jason. He's 7 weeks old and o so adorable!!  And Jason's almost 2 year old brother is also cute. Whenever we say anything to him all he says is 'I know' or 'I don't know' and laugh. Just so adorable. And when I had to leave, he was all sad. When I picked up my bag, he took it from me and put it back on the floor so I won't leave. I could talk forever about Jason and Jonathan. But I didn't really like the Houston whether because it was raining the whole time so when we drove anywhere bugs would hit the window and front bumper. So by the end of the trip, the front of the car was smothered with bug guts. YUCK!  hehe =)  Oh no!  My time is almost up!  Well, I guess I can spend the remaining time saying my good byes. Goodbye, chao. Write to you laters. Got only a few more seconds. It has been good writing down my feelings, getting it all out of my system. I feel lighter. OK, BYE!!!!!!!  "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am watching mtv cribs with Chris Pontius. Today was hot and I'm supposed to go running with Nathan but it's still too hot so I want to go later. Maybe I'll get some of my work done before then so I won't stay up so late like I have been lately. I'm really tired so I took a nap today and slept like a rock. I don't know when I'm going to supper though because I don't want to eat before I work out or I'll feel sick so I might just get Nathan to cook for me tonight. I am starting to miss everyone from back home because I'm not usually away from my family, friends, and Sam for this long. I guess I will just have to wait a couple more days to go home for labor day weekend. I want to go home to see everyone but I really don't want to go to the football game and that's what all of my friends are going to want to do. I'm running out of things to think about because the TV is on and it's distracting me. The song on this commercial is going to be in my head now for the rest of the day. I like all my classes so far but I'm still kind of scared. Especially about biology because my prof is going really quickly over the information and it's hard to stay up with him. I'm getting tired looking at this computer screen. my eyes are getting droopy but I can't get tired and go to sleep now because then I won't get anything done and I won't be able to sleep well tonight. just like last night I couldn't fall asleep forever and then when I finally fell asleep I kept waking up so I felt like I didn't sleep at all. my strawberry smoothie was really good just now. I'm kind of hungry but lately I haven't felt that good so I don't feel like eating. Maybe ill just wait until later when my roommate wants to go so I'll have someone to sit with. I hate going to the cafeteria without knowing someone because then I sit with people I don't know and we're always eating so we can't really talk with food in our mouth but I want to meet them and not be rude. I'm sure they understand because here at hardin house all the girls are really sweet. they are all in sororities though and me and my roommate Madison are they only 2% not in one. oh well I have way too much school work and other stuff to do and I know if I would have rushed I wouldn't have time for anything else and I really need to do good this first semester and get it behind me and get used to everything. My back has been hurting a lot lately because of an injury from track season but I can't get into a back specialist for a while so I kind of just have to live with it. and I love to exercise but it hurts me for days afterwards. I decided that I'm just going to start working out and if it hurts oh well because I really don't want to gain the freshman fifteen. ha. my boyfriend goes to school in Lubbock at Texas tech and it feels so different not being able to see each other everyday like we used to. it seems like we fight every day no matter what and yesterday was our one year anniversary so I went and got him a present Saturday with my mom at the mall in san Antonio. she wanted me to go back to Hondo with her just for the weekend because her and my dad missed me but I wanted to come back up here for the weekend and party with some of my friends. my parents got to see my yesterday though. they came up after lunch with my grandparents and they brought even more stuff for my dorm room. my mom has been keeping herself busy at home by being creative and making cute things to decorate with but I really enjoy when she brings me stuff. we went to eat at hula hut on lake Austin and it was really good like seafood/Mexican food. I've never had a shrimp enchilada before then but it was great and my dad ordered an awesome dessert tray that we all shared and loved. then we went out on the deck and watch all the people on the lake and just talked for a while. "
Tell me about yourself.,"This past weekend I took a short journey back to my home city of San Antonio, Texas. I went there to get some more items from my house, and as you can tell I'm still in the process of moving in all of my belongings into my dorm. The dorm itself I like very much because it is a good enough distance from the university itself so that I can feel as though I am actually going home each day after classes; plus the food here is excellent. This semester so far has been going by a little slow just as the first few weeks of every school year do. However, last week was very satisfying due to the fact that I got much accomplished. I got much of my studying done and I finally got my book situation in order. At first when I went to the Co-op I bought all these different books for each of the classes I am taking and then I came to discover that I didn't need about three of them. So then I had to make time to go back and return the books that I no longer needed, and I had the pleasure of standing in the horrendous line it seemed they formed just for me. This weekend I also went to the football game to see my favorite team in the land play a not-so-good team, but I still managed to have a great time. I bought two tickets for my brother and my best friend who came in to visit me. The day after the game when I went back to San Antonio I got to visit with my baby brother who is now about seven months old. He is beginning to talk and make little noises that babies make. I was a little sad to leave him so soon after his birth, but I will see him every now and then when I get a chance to journey back home. I also got to spend time with my girlfriend of about two years. We went out to eat and to see a movie. We weren't sure what movie to see so I thought I would let her pick because of the nice that I am, and she - being the girl that she is - picked wicker park which is a story about this guy who falls in love with a girl two years ago and he sees her walking down the street. He immediately bolts out the door of the shoe store he is standing in and tries to catch her, but his friend stops him to talk and he loses her, but to make a long story short he gets sidetracked bye this psycho girl who falls in love with him and is trying to keep him away from the girl who he originally wanted. In the end he finally gets to talk to the first girl and they are happy as can be. I can't wait for winter time. It is definitely one of my favorite times of the year because each year my family and I go skiing in Colorado - occasionally some place different - and go to most of the resorts there. One of the worst times I've ever had there is when I wrecked one of the rental cars we brought with us, and also this past year we went and I jumped a big snow jump, landed wrong, and I smashed my head into some ice leaving myself with a nice concussion. All together I would have to say that I'm very excited about this year, and I can't wait to meet more people and have some of the most memorable times of my life. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Working out is stressful. Especially if all I do is arms. Man I am tired. I wish I could have a protein shake or supplement right now to be able to maximize my workout. I need to go to the bathroom but I can't since I have to right this. I'm glad that I finished the reading assignment over the weekend. Oh my arms are so heavy! I like working out but sometimes it takes a toll. My biceps are bulging and pulsing. Man I wish I could play a game right now. And now I have gone blank a little. Its tough to do this. To think about what one is thinking. I need to move my mouse. There we go. Now I need an arm pad or an extension to my desk. Man I wish I could rationally think sometimes. Or maybe I do. I really need to extend this desk. Now I'm reaching way too far out but my arms are so dead that it kind of feels good. Wow, now I'm getting thirsty, but its probably because I just got done working out. It says it is 76 degrees outside. Let me actually check. It is. A shake would taste good right about now. Jester 2nd floor was good today, but not like I had expected it. A lot cheaper though. Its weird how they charge more if you use a different form of payment than Dine in dollars. I've always wondered why lunch is cheaper than dinner. I usually eat as much or sometimes more at lunch than dinner. So I wonder why most restaurants charge more for dinner. It probably is the belief that people eat more at dinner, or maybe they are trying to pull in crowds at lunchtime because they are not as busy then. Who knows and honestly who cares. The room next door to us has a very squeaky door. It slams hard. Ouch my deltoid. I am hungry, or maybe thirsty. I really can't decide right now. Ouch! Wow 11 more minutes. This has kind of gone by fast. I thought it would take forever but it is an okay assignment. And I'm so glad I did my readings the weekend before. It allowed me to have more fun time for me and time to do this assignment. Those 30 seconds went by fast. The people are always going in and out or maybe that's just what it sounds like to me. Up till like even 2 am in the morning I can always hear people outside my window. I wonder why they are up so late outside. Usually people up that late are either studying or getting drunk out of their mind. Well I'm going to get something to drink right now. I have had the grape flavor yet so I'm going to see what that's like. Never mind, my roommate and his friend took the refrigerated one. Going over to get more to cool down even showed me more how I was sore, or maybe just tired. Now I have a coke though. But I need to fill my food void. Some applesauce would be nice. But I do love sour punch straws. Mmmmm. They are so good. Nah ill have applesauce. There are also some grapes too. Green grapes! My favorite. I don't know why but I've never liked red ones or purple. WITHe they call it. My favorite color was purple because I loved the grape flavor so much. Now I've changed my ways because I've learned that purple is a feminine color. Now to get some applesauce. I have to have 2 at a time or its not enough. I'm a klutz. I always drop things or trip at the worst times, but then most people don't trip when they want to. I don't know why but I've been wanting to get fatter. Or at least gain wait for a long time now, but I need to eat healthy because I have high cholesterol. I always wanted to gain weight because of football, now I just say it because I always have. When buying this applesauce it was most economical and accessible. They are 4oz each. It says that each cup is one fruit serving of an apple, or just one apple. Yes! 1 minute! This applesauce is a little watery. I hate when ketchup comes out at first and its has a watery mix to it. That really disgusts me when at first ketchup isn't my favorite thing to eat. But it goes good with French fries! "
Tell me about yourself.,"Wow, so here I go. This is actually pretty exciting, I don't think I have ever had such a fun writing assignment. Jessica's music is on, her music was playing at the same time as mine, hers was rap, mine was ""honey and the moon"", weird combination. she's still listening to it. I have an aftertaste of godiva chocolate in my mouth, my sister sent me my shirt I forgot. and I was just at drews, across the hall. I wonder how I did on my bio exam. We get the grades back today in our review session. It was stressful but I think I did ok. We'll see I guess. My sheets are bright I wonder what everyone is doing at home right now. Let's see. its almost 3, so everyone's working. I miss Jude, he's so cute and now that I'm here I'm going to miss out on him taking his first steps, him first talking, etc. But it was fun watching him grow. I miss him the most. It'll be nice to be home next weekend, I want to lay out in the sun by my pool, with my dogs. Tonight's going to be busy, with me catching up in all my classes and all. But what I really want to do is see Drew, because I like hanging out with him. But then once I get back into my room, and I shut the door, that's when reality sets in, and that's when I realize that I have to stay with Scott because he needs me right now. And it wouldn't be fair after all of this. This writing assignment is pretty crazy, I still have awhile to go. Maybe I just don't have enough to write about? Let me think here. I find myself staring into my panoramic photo of a sunrise on the beach in Hawaii. It's a pretty tight picture, and I wish I could just be back there right now, instead of stressing here at school. Even though this experience is pretty awesome. I still find myself stressing more than the ordinary college student. My insecurities keep building up , until something or someone comes along and then I'll let them fall down. One of my goals is to be able to walk around with my head raised high up, chin up, smiling, confident. I wish I could be that person, but for some reason I guess I feel too uneasy about my appearances. Most likely, that is the result of going to a school with really judgmental people. Oh well, it'll just be something I need to grow out of here. That's one thing that I love about UT, no one really cares what you look like, talk like, etc. It's a nice change. Last night I had another crazy dream, I want to start writing them down but sometimes I just can't remember them. Like last night, some guys broke into my house, and they were chasing us out. But I somehow convinced them with my kindness or something (as I do in many of my dreams that are very similar to this) that they should leave us alone. I just remember showing them my ""mastiff"" dog. Ok, is that even a dog, or did I make that up or what. Whoa, a crazy thing that came across my mind yesterday was this thought (I was actually thinking about it yesterday in psychology class): ""They say that color is the result of light being absorbed or reflected off of an object. So in order to see color, there has to be light, right?  If that is true, then is it true whenever you go into a pitch black room, everything is actually without color?! I know that everything wouldn't be in black and white, but wouldn't everything be in black at least?! Everyone would be of the same color in a dark room? It's pretty mind baffling to me. "" Also, I've heard that whenever you dream, you don't really dream in color, but your mind and memory make up the colors. They are not true colors. Who really knows anyways? The zipper of my Dior makeup bag is dipping into the cap of my orange juice bottle that I had this morning. Last night was all fun and games until I got home and realized how unsure I am of everything right now, and it's really not a good feeling. I guess I'm just getting used to this whole thing, just transitioning. Jess forgot to get milk last night, so I had dry cereal this morning. There is still some left in my bowl right here, I was too busy rushing around, trying to meet Scott in time for chemistry. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Stream of Consciousness that term reminds me so much of Virginia Woolf and my long semester studying her and Mrs. Dalloway. I can't even think about it without thinking of her and her crazy life and the craziness with how Mrs. Dalloway was written and it makes me so sad because her life was just so sad. I feel so bad for her. I wonder how fast twenty minutes really is I bet it may end up seeming forever and this writing will go on forever but I guess it is kind of interesting I just am worried my hands will begin to hurt from all of this typing. I am so glad that it is Labor Day weekend and I am going to get a long weekend to catch up on a few things like sleep and fun and I guess some studying too although that won't be too fun so that will actually take away from some of the fun goal. it is so interesting how I am sitting here all alone in my room and in fact most of the time it gets kind of lonely but sitting her and I some way expressing my thoughts instead of just listening to them and doing nothing makes it not so lonely and for once it is actually quiet in the dorm so that I can concentrate on just about anything. I hope this year goes well because I think that it really needs to be a good semester and that it will progress to a good year I if The semester goes well. I'm getting kind of sad now that because I am leaving town tomorrow I am going to miss the first Football which will be my first Texas football game and I have heard they are a great experience and a ton of fun, but at least there are plenty of other games that I can attend. My hand is really beginning to hurt that is really pretty sad considering I haven't even typed for 10 minutes. I wonder if I am missing out on anything while I am sitting her typing this but I guess it isn't that big of a deal I don't think there are many people her anyway and I don't know where anyone is. I was thinking about how when I graduated from high school that I would be balling my eyes out but I didn't cry then I thought I would cry when My parents left me here all alone. but the weird thing is I haven't cried or anything yet I haven't even gotten homesick. I mean let's face it isn't like I would have anything spectacular to do even if I was home so I guess that helps in the homesickness department. It is so cold in my room I am absolutely freezing and There is no way in which to control the air, I need gloves and winter boots. I really think that people need to something about the coolness of the buildings I mean I know it is hot outside and all but because it is hot outside students want to wear shorts and other things like that to keep cool when out in the heat, but then you step in a building and dorms are the absolute worst of all and you freeze to death like I am surprised I haven't gotten frost bite from these frigid places. Well the time has actually gone faster than I expected it to it hasn't been all that bad once I got over the whole Virginia Woolf suicide and her book that I had to suffer through and analyze. It has actually been kind of fun I mean all I have been doing is saying what is on my mind and how I am feeling and that isn't so hard as long as you know that not everyone in the world is going to be reading what you write because personally I Don't' want everyone in the world to know how I feel all the time it is pretty personal for the most part. I am really excited about getting to hang out at the lake this weekend and being able to relax and have food other than from the cafeteria not that the food is all that bad but a homecooked meal is the absolute best. that is real comfort food. Wow I am beginning to feel hungry now but I don't know for what also I really need these twenty minutes to over so that I can run and go get a drink I am really thirsty. oh my gosh my hands are like icicles between the pain from typing and the temperature of the room my hands are really beginning to suffer. but hey I don't have to type for too much longer.        "
Tell me about yourself.,"Being a twin I always wonder if my brother thinks like I do. I don't mean like does he have the same thought I mean does he see the world in the same perspective as me. My mind like to wander and I imagine many different scenarios in my head. Like where I will be in 20 years how long I will live and why people act the way they do. Everyday I think of the things why people seem to not want to try and others try there hardest. Then you have people who succeed no matter what and I wonder why them. Then there are people who seem to go no where in life. I am not seriously making this up for the past year or so I have been trying to figure out the world. I guess since I have left home many things in my life have changed some for the good and others just different from my life at home. I also wonder in my head a lot are we all determined to do a specific job or career. I felt at one time I was determined to be an astronaut, but now I am leaning towards the media business. I would like to make a movie that answers many questions that people are struggling with mainly people that are going through changes in the life. Although change is not necessarily it creates a sense in my mind at least that this could either be a bad  and good experience. I am talking about me coming to college. If this writing seems to be changing topics a lot then that is probably because that is how I think I continuously switching ideas in my mind. It is a wonder of why I have some of the thoughts I have, but we wont go into that. Being my first to take Psychology I wonder what the class is going to offer me, how it will help me to explore the human mind. I have also noticed that while being at college my sleep patterns have changed I stay up late get up early sleep on the weekends. Since being here I have started some sort of routine as far as my day goes, but I often wonder why us as people have routine and if they are inevitably unavoidable. This summer I worked in a grocery store was it fun no not really but it gave me a perspective of how I should view the world. There would be weeks when I got up at before 5:00 am everyday I kind of got this feeling like is this what I will be doing for the rest of my life. I thought to myself therefore I will do good in college to help better the career. Working forty hours a week and making about three hundred dollars I wondered a lot of times how some one lived on that and I guess they do somehow. That is why it kind of bothers me that we have some of these people blaming the economy on one person when I believe there is an overall problem in certain area. But are we certain at all what goes on. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Hey what's up? I just got home from school and hopefully I can finish doing this before my sister gets home and takes over the computer. Today was cool I got my hair cut finally and the girl that did it was really sweet. I wish my hair was thicker though. I'm trying to type as fast as I can in twenty minutes so I'm wondering how much I'll really end up typing. I can't wait to go to college station this weekend. I hope mom doesn't find out that I ran into that pole in the garage. I think I'm just going to tell her that a car must have hit it. I have the story all planned out and everything. I'd much rather drive Karla's car to college station this weekend. I can't wait to see Austin again. He's so awesome. I had so much fun at Emo's last night, Minus the Bear rocked. Sometimes I feel out of place at that place though because it seems like everyone is trying to hard to look like they don't want to go crazy when the band is playing. I'm so happy they played my favorite song, too. I was surprised how many Victoria people were there too. I think Nick is so cute too! I haven't seen Lynette in a while that was surprising. I wonder if she still thinks I'm a bitch for all that crap in high school. I'm starting to realize that Austin isn't as fun as I thought it'd be. It's a crazy place to live, but after being in College Station all I think about is how fun it'd be to live there. There's so many teenagers and so much to do at night. The cat's distracting me it keeps trying to drink my water. I think I hurt it when he flew off the table. I'm going to make pizza to eat pretty soon here. I can't remember the last time I ate at the same time Karla did. Hopefully my car will be ready soon because this no ac is really pissing me off. Which doesn't really matter anyways since there's no place to park without having to pay five dollars. I don't like going to Eco class very much. I feel like the teacher is going to jump up and ask some question and I have no idea what he's talking about. I haven't even been reading as much as I thought I would in school. Maybe I should start too because it'll probably start to get hard and then I really won't know what anyone's talking about. I always wonder if Austin is getting tired of me. I know he always thinks about getting with another girl, but I'd really like to see what he does and how he is when he's all drunk at some party. That's going to be weird when he joins that frat but him and Roe fit in with them pretty good I think. I know I should have joined that one group but I think I just wanted to know someone in it before I did. I don't think I could ever afford to pay that much money anyways. I can't even hold on to a hundred in a week. I need to stop buying so many clothes but there's too many cute things I want. I can't wait to get regular cable, these channels suck. I think me and Austin will last a long time, we don't fight at all, so maybe being far away can be a good thing. I bet a lot of people think I'm stupid for staying with him "
Tell me about yourself.,"College isn't at all what I thought it was going to be. MAN, that French class is really kicking my but right now!!  But, I'm determined to suck it up and get through it with a decent grade!!  I feel so insignificant compared to John, he probably has no idea what it feels like to feel so behind everyone else!  But of coarse, I would never let on to that around him. I really can't wait till I finish this semester and maybe next semester I will have a better experience. I really think that 17 hrs for a freshman is a little too much, especially for me. I really feel like I cheated someone out of a spot well earned here at UT. I don't feel like I'm smart enough to be here. But I'm sure that I'm not the only person that had those thoughts every now and then. I really just hope I can keep a b avg so I can keep that scholarship!!!  I should probably make French a pass/fail class. I'm just so jealous of people that catch on to language so quickly and leave students like me in the dust!!  Ah. I should just be glad that I have the opportunity to explore myself here instead of griping about it 24/7. And MOM!!!  she can't keep her mouth shut. If I wanted John to know I wasn't feeling very confident then I would have told him!!!!  But of coarse, he calls and says, ""mom said you couldn't handle your FR class. Well, just remember that school is your job!""  I know JOHN!!!!!!!!!!!  he just doesn't understand that I have too much pride in me to admit that, yeah, I was crying to mom that I really didn't know if I could keep up in French!  I hate it when he sees that ""failing"" side of me. I want to be as invincible as he is. And that's impossible. I can't live up to his example!!  There's no way I'll graduate first in my class here at UT like he did and get some awesome job in new York that pays more money than I've ever seen at once!!!  It sux having a brother that had scholarships that paid all of his college expenses with money still left over!!!!!  He amazes me. Maybe that's my problem is I'm trying too hard and wasting all my energy to impress him!  Its not Mom, I know she just wants these years to be the best years of my life, but john wants them to be my JOB!!!!!!  What the hell!!!!  Can I not have a normal family that just is happy and supportive of me and understands that I am an individual that will do and accomplish different things than they ever did in different ways than they ever thought of!!!  Maybe UT's not for me. Maybe I'm meant to be at some rinkydink community college, where not that much is expected of me!!  But no. That's not me. There's just something in me that won't let me settle on average         "
Tell me about yourself.,"Okay dokey here we go. just thought I would get this assignment out of the way before I'm overloaded with other stuff. Or either put off until the last minute. I hate when I do that. Must not do that any more you know you can tell yourself that repeatedly but that doesn't mean that it is going to happen. My past shows oh well. Man my stomach hurts just got done eating a salad and now omg pain. Why is that these days it seems like my stomach can't handle anything without getting upset gross. Oh well listening to a new cd I got this weekend and I'm liking it. The band was really good live too ill just have to go out and see them again sometime. Omg this is a lot of writing for only 3 min. I feel bad for the people who are going to read all the students papers. 20minutes of writing never seemed like so much well. Now that I'm actually doing it I'm sure that there is going to be a few pages worth. Once for another UT experiment I had to do this too and it was hand written for 20min I much better prefer the typing (is that even proper English. Note to self again. Work on grammar) ohm well at the other UT experiment that I was doing. I was in high school and they put me in the back o f the library (never can spell that word) and told me to write about whatever it is we wanted for 20min. Well there I am sitting writing away thinking to myself wow I've been writing for a long time. Why haven't they called me up yet. But I never saw the start time. And sadly I ended up writing for 40min. That is a lot especially be hand. These days everyone it seems is so dependent on computers. Good at times bad at other. Only 14 minutes to go. This has to be by far the most enjoyable assignment I have received so far. I think I enjoy writing it seems to be relaxing. I think I shall start writing in a journal again. Although I only seem to write in my journal when I'm angry and htne lock it away until another god awful days comes along. Maybe I should start again but this time maybe daily or so. Everyone says it is a stress reliever. Ha-ha this cd is cute. The lyrics crack me up at times. He is talking about how the bank classifies him as ""poor"" because he doesn't have much money in the bank. And believe me I know how that feels. Grrrr I need to get some source of income. Seriously. Well my stomach is feeling better I wonder what the deal was. Omg today after class. Since I'm to stub run to wait for the bus I walked up the HUGE hill to c panking and today for the first time with a back-pack full of books!! OMG the walked own the hill doesn't compare to the walk up. I thought I was going to die ha-ha but I guess its a good work out plus the what 50pounds of books Hahira damn good work out. Man 9 minutes to go. Good thing this essay isn't graded on grammar or spelling because I think I am the worst speller (that doesn't even sound like the right word) in the world. But and English teacher of mine once told me that bad spelling is a sign of intelligence. Hahahaha ironic. He was a great teacher though I really miss his class. He had a way of making the (at the team high school) students look at the world with open eyes. More mature eyes . Ha-ha and he would through in dark humor every once in a while . Woke the class up. Great teacher. I've actually loved all my English teachers in high school although I am horrible at writing and reading. But their classes were challenging and fun. Everything else in school was to much of a breeze for me. Although NOW at UT I'm a little scared. I hope I can handle it. I think as long as I can make it past the first year I should be able to have the hang of it and do fine the next couple of years . Right ha-ha. You know what this assignment reminds me of. The new TV show THE DAYS. How the teenager dude sits in his room and writes in his journal ha-ha too cute. Didn't dugie houser (can't remember if that is his name or not) do the same thing. Aww poor guy since he was  a doc at such a young age. Don't you ever wonder if kids like that  miss out on their childhoods. I feel bad for them. Seeing ym younger bro and sis grow up hurts because now I know they are going to be exposed to the real world. And they will no longer have that innocence and purity as they once did. The real world is harsh. Man if I could be 13 again I sure would. Yet when I was 13 I remember wanting to be 16 and then wanting to be 18. And not that I'm turning 19. Ohm DEPRESSING. Last year to be a teenager. Although I never really did all the teenage stuff. It was all to immature for me. But soon I'm going to be 20 and that means. Reaching adult. You can't be called a kid anymore. All though I love to call people kid all the time its the greatest. people should call each other kid again maybe peoples outlook on life wouldn't be so scary. Well 20min up. I bet I look like I have ADD. prob. do. Ha-ha  "
Tell me about yourself.,"WELL I GUESS I CAN START WITH MY DREAM LAST NIGHT SINCE THAT IS WHAT I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT ALL DAY. it WAS SO CRAZY. I had a dream that I was sitting on the couch in my room and talking with a friend when all of a sudden there is a knock at the door. I open the door and it is a dark figure, like a person, but the lighting in my apartment was that of the time of day that dusk sets in. Well she walks I and covers my mouth and lays me down on the floor and holds me with all force while she is chanting some mysterious chant in my ear. I don't know what she was saying but at that point I wake up in my dream as I'm struggling to move my body. I couldn't move until I realized I was out of my dream, which was maybe 3 seconds later. How creepy is that. When I woke up the chant was repeating in my head for like 10 seconds and then I completely forgot it. I don't know what that was about but it seems to me that it has to do with someone putting a spell on me. I've felt ghosts before but I never felt a bad sense coming from them. Weird. I always wonder what dreams are really supposed to mean. I mean people can buy dream books all they want but what are the chances of those interpretations being the same for all of us? I am a little worried about that but I haven't really been a bad person in the past with anyone. That I can think of. Oh well. Anyways I have to really buckle down today and do some serious studying if I want to enjoy the weekend like I should. Hopefully I will be studying on the beach Saturday night. Not that the South Padre beach ids that beautiful. After going to Cancun for a week though I guess its hard to actually top that beach. That was the best time I believe in my life so far. It is good to know that I will be going on many more trips like that considering how easy it was to plan that trip. Saving the money was super hard but I feel like if I really want to do something I am capable of making that happen. I hope this weekend is as good as last weekend. I am going back to San Antonio to see my family since it has been two weeks since my last visit. I really love the night life over here though. Maybe because everything is so new over here and I really love change period. I am not scared to completely change my patterns in friendships and relationships for that matter. I came over here knowing 3 people in the whole city. Now I know just a few more but the possibility of me meeting so many more is very high on the scale. I really miss my best friend a lot though. Her and I hung out all summer together, and all last year in school for that matter. She was all I needed and I was the same for her. Now we are spirited and she's getting back with her boyfriend and will probably end up married with children. Its a sad world when you see people you love so dependant on the wrong things at the wrong time. Her relationship with that boy is so lame. Thank god I have no time for stuff like that right now. I cannot relate to her attachment to him and would love to keep it that way for a really long time. Hopefully she will snap out of it though and realize that her whole life is ahead of her. Man. This is a really long time to be typing straight on the computer. Everyone around me is getting annoyed by how much I am typing. They keep staring at me, then the screen and back to me. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Lets  see well I've been trying to explore the campus and look for spots to study that no one can find. But unfortunately there are too many damn students in this place to accomplish that goal. This Life Sciences Library is really nice. I think its the high ceilings that make me feel so comfortable in here. There are always open computers in here as well. Well my time is almost up. My experience in the psy class is very important to me considering I want to be a psychiatrist one day. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am in the library right now writing this stream of consciousness. I just had dinner. It was very delicious. I ate at the Kinsolving dormitory food center. The library is really quiet and I can hear the tying on the computer. People are walking in and out and it is a little bit distracting. I can't wait until this week is over. It will be Labor day weekend. I can't believe a holiday is just around the corner. It seems like just yesterday it was summer and I was having fun playing with my friends and hanging out. Over the Labor day weekend, I would love to go back home to Houston and see my family, but I kind of would prefer to just stay here in Austin. There is so much to do here and there is so much freedom. In a way it can be good but I really need to manage my time wisely. Today's psychology was really interesting. I loved the in class experiment that was done. It was pretty cool how the experiment worked especially since the first time was easy to tell when the girl was lying and the second time was really hard. I feel tired right now and I would like to go to sleep, but I know I should get this writing assignment out of the way. I was talking to my brother about computers today. It was fun but hard at the same time since it was over the phone. My mind went blank for a while and I can't think of anything to write. Tomorrow is one of my best friend's birthday. I can't believe she will be one year older. She is a senior in high school right now and I bet she is stressing over college applications like I was during senior year. I hope she gets everything done in time. I remember senior year was really interesting. I had to research a lot with colleges and what I wanted to do with my life especially choosing a major. So far, education is what I want to do. I think it will be fun especially if I decide to work with elementary students. I am feeling really sleepy right now and I can feel my fingers moving more slowly than before. I miss my family. Even though I am used to being away for a month. I know I will begin to miss them so much more in the next couple of months. I hope they are doing well and everything is working out in their lives. I also miss my friends back home especially my church family. I can't believe I am actually going to say this or actually type it but I also miss my pastor. Especially his sermons. As I am here in Austin, I have been church hunting with some friends and the pastor's sermons here are just not the same. I guess I am really used to how he tried to make it apply to our daily lives and tried to really relate to us. Especially since I grew up in that church, I really miss all the good memories I have made there. I can't wait until the weather gets colder here in Austin. I heard last year it snowed for a day in the morning. I really would like to see falling snow. I really love the cold weather and I like to play in the snow. Today's weather was nice. I could feel the cool breeze blowing in my face. There was less sun than usual. Maybe it is supposed to rain who knows. But I can definitely feel a weather change coming soon hopefully. I still can't believe that I am a freshman in college. I thought when I arrived here I would finally believe it but it is really hard to sink in. So far classes have been fun and a little boring at the same time. I try to think positively and try to learn something out of each time I spend in class. I am really worried about the tests and quizzes here at the university. I just don't know what to expect especially since different teachers do different things. I really hope that I will do well in the first semester of college in fact I hope to do well all the years I am in college. I think I've kind of forgotten how to study. After college applications were done and over with and after I knew where I was going to attend college, I kind of stopped studying really really hard for classes. I still studied but just not as hard and not as much as I should have. I feel like taking a shower and going to bed now. My eyes feel they are slowing shutting but I'm trying to keep awake. There are so many people here at the library. I knew there would be a lot of people but it's amazing to see how a lot of people use their time wisely and study and also take the time to do their homework even when there are so many temptations to go out and party. I suddenly feel itchy everywhere. I think a bug bit me. It is really annoying and itchy. This has been the most exciting assignment ever. It will be really weird to look back on what I wrote.       "
Tell me about yourself.,"I have just returned to my room from my biology class. Madeline forgot her notes so she has borrowed mine so I cannot study them at the moment. I am very excited because I got a full meal for only $3. 00! I got a free coke, a free corner of a sandwich, 2 free candy bars and I bought a berry and yogurt parfait for 3 bucks, which by the way was really tasty. It is in my refrigerator now because I have only eaten breakfast about two hours ago. Well tomorrow at 3:30 I will be done with classes for the week and I am thinking of driving home for the night to Lake Jackson. It is a three hour drive, but I am not really homesick, just feel kind of lost. The reason I'll tell anyone else for going home is to pick up my new computer. See the one I have works fine plugged into the wall but for some reason unknown to myself and three Dell representatives/technical experts the battery will not charge. SO they have sent me a entire system replacement, after first trying to merely replace the battery. Which is what should happen because when one orders a $2000 system they would hope it would work. So my next class is in about an hour and a half. It is biology which is interesting to me for the most part. It is my major, but I have been planning on changing it. I chose it mostly because what I was interested in was medicine and I wanted to go to medical school after college. Now, I am not quite sure that is what is for me, although it was never a sure thing. Now I was thinking of changing to some sort of liberal arts degree where I could take more classes of interest to me and also Spanish which I recently tested out of 13 hours!! I could also go from there to med school or law school or whatever sort of graduate school I decide on. There are so many decisions to be made. Now that I have finally chosen a college. I still am wondering about that decision. I mean I Have always loved Texas, my dad went here and the school just has everything to offer. Maybe that is the problem too much?? I just sort of feel like I'm not fitting in, but then again isn't that what UT is about, being an individual? Well, I definitely like to be an individual and my own self, but I would like some friends, a group who'll call and see what I'm doing, call to hang out. I mean I have been here only 11 days and I'm worried? Well not yet, I am still giving it time. But I just feel so down on myself and anti-social. The only people I have really hung around are from my hometown. Not that it's all bad, I just was so ready to branch out into something NEW! So going home just seems like a good answer at the time, I even thought maybe I chose the wrong college, but how can I say that when I've been here not even two weeks. At home, making friends was always easy. I was the center of focus there. Had everything, here there is so many that I am, well, unnoticed. That in itself is a change. But then I think isn't everyone else going through the same thing? Then if everyone else is, then why don't we just get together? Well I guess the world does not work that way. But I have not given up yet, there is still hope. The first football game is Saturday and I know that will reinforce my love for the school. I loved going to the games when I wasn't a student at this school. Maybe I can meet some friends then. So it is labor day weekend coming up. Mostly I need to be studying, but that is what school is about. I think we may float the river, so that will be fun. I have started swimming this week and really want to go tonight, but I have a study session for Bio at 7pm, ,hopefully there will be enough time to get there swim, change and make it over to Welch. I just am not sure how to work it all out. drive, walk, ride the bus. I don't live in a city and things are so different here. The town I am from, I didn't even live in the city limits. Hhmmmm. but I really need to workout. I am not going to get fat in college. I need to lose pounds right now, not gain them. But food is everywhere, I guess you can see by the free food. Well maybe I can just eat some now and some between next class to prevent excess snacking. But the candy bars aren't good. Ok, before next class I need to read some bio and some psychology, but what I really want to do is lay in my bed, listen to music, watch TV maybe take a nap?. Nope not here in the college world. Wow, I like to write down my thoughts it is soul clearing. "
Tell me about yourself.,"This writing assignment seems a little silly. I mean I'm probably going to spend the first 10 minutes of this thinking about the actual assignment and that doesn't seem very interesting. Actually I'm already thinking about something else. I can't wait for Austin City Limits. We keep forgetting to buy tickets, I need to write that down. I highly doubt it will sell out but I want to hurry up and buy them. Jack Johnson is so good. I can't wait to see him. We definitely need more decorations in our room. Fifty percent of our walls are still blank and its sort of depressing. Maybe that poster sale is still going on. Maybe I'll have my mom send some of my posters from home. I need to remember to call my mom later. I wonder if she misses me a lot. Oh god, it's only been 3 minutes. This is getting a bit boring. I really hope surprising Brian was a good idea. I just hope Doug doesn't give it away. Hell, I hope I don't give it away! I wonder if I'm doing this assignment right. oh well Pennebaker said himself that no one was probably going to read it. I need to do some calculus after this. I'm so pumped I actually understood it today Hopefully it'll stay like this. I'm so worried about the tests in that class. Ill be so pissed if that class brings down my grade. damnit I keep hitting something that makes the cursor jump lines its so annoying. I just love Jack's voice, its so soothing. Its hard to write as you think. My thoughts are moving faster than my fingers. I hope the other surveys I do online aren't as stupid as the one I just did. I'm happy I guess, though, that it was so hard to name things I was dissatisfied with in my life. I couldn't even think of ten. I made up half of them. well not exactly made up but they weren't things I was actually stressing over. Was that even close to being grammatically correct? 7 minutes 30 seconds. ahhh I hope this weekend is fun. I'm looking at the football stadium out my window. I'm excited for my first UT football game ever. It better be good. I hope our seats are good. I wonder what Kelly's sister will be like. hopefully fun and easy to talk to. I hope I meet a lot of people at the meeting I'm going to tonight. Hopefully guys to be exact. Although I bet its going to be a lot of chicks since its the university democrats. I hope not everyone is a hippie/chip on their shoulder/ socialist type. I mean I hope they're intelligent and not just the ""being different for the sake of being different type"" 10 minutes. half way there Yay! I'm really worried about Laura I hope she finds her dream job soon. I hate seeing her depressed because I know she is but she doesn't talk about it. I hope her and dell are working out. he can be so oblivious sometimes. Aren't most guys? My first instinct is to treat this like an essay and explain who I am talking about but I don't think this is supposed to be like an essay. What the hell would a shrink get from reading this crap? It can't be very interesting to anyone else. I need to go DVD shopping, our DVD collection is seriously lacking. I hope raising our beds isn't that hard. we definitely need a change in our room. I think I want another bowl of lucky charms but I suppose I should finish this thing first. 4. 99 for a box of lucky charms! what a rip. I guess I should have know Cypress would be like that. I should ask Kelly if she wants to go to the grocery store tomorrow. It sucks not having a car down here. I miss my jeep. Its going to feel weird to drive when I get home. I can't freaking wait!! 6 more minutes. I guess its going pretty fast. This thing just seems like a waste of time but I guess it must have some purpose if we have to do it. I actually need to finish reading for this class. can't forget to do that. wow looking at what I've wrote my thoughts seem pretty disorganized. Hmm what does that say about me? I think being a therapist would suck. I wouldn't be able to listen to depressed people whine all day long. wow that sounded terrible. But I suppose its true. Maybe I'm just not patient enough 4 minutes I need to figure out how my scanner works. I need to take pictures so I can send them to my family. my fingers are starting to get tired. I've typed a lot. I still haven't found light bulbs for my stupid Ikea lamp. Maybe we can go to target tonight I think my punctuation and spelling as gotten worse as I went along. oh well. I think he said that we don't need any of that. 2 minutes Thinking about my thoughts is hard, I'm like freezing up. I wonder what would happen if I hit the finish button now. I'm not going to try it because after all of this I want my credit for this assignment! I wish I was disciplined (spelling??) enough to keep a journal. It would be fun to go back and read stuff like 5 years later. I always start it and never pick it up again. I wonder what that says about me? I'm busy. ohhhh 50 seconds! I wonder what the FBA meeting will be like. hopefully nice people will be there I wonder how much of a commitment it is. hopefully  "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, I have to confess, this is an extremely difficult thing for me to do. I am an extremely objective person and it's hard for me focus on something when there is no clear goal in sight, but maybe this will get easier as I go. I hear TV in the next room. My mom is in the kitchen and watching the Republican National Convention. I really should be watching it you because you see I'm a government major (at least that's the plan right now). However, and ironically, the very thing that is going to earn me my government major is also what is keeping me from watching the convention. There now talking about Kerry not being a good leader but the AC which is located next to my room has just come on and now I can't hear. Wow, this is getting a little weird having to make myself consciously voice in writing what I'm thinking. It's amazing you can be so unaware of the thoughts that your own brain  is thinking. Ah, pancakes are ready. I would like to go eat them now but I'm stuck here for another 9 minutes and 43 seconds. OOppss, she used baking soda instead of baking powder. No pancakes I guess. I went to the Phantom of the Opera last semester. It was a Broadway production and vg. I have a pamphlet from the evening sitting on my desk, which is why I bring it up. I was depressing though, for all  the talent and wonderful set changes. Do you like  the sound of the AC. I  do. I don't know why but it comforts me. I think the reason it does is because when I was younger the AC would come and there was a vent right over my bed  so to keep warm I would have to snuggle deeper into my covers and I like to snuggle. That was a run on sentence but that's how I think, in run ons, so I'm just trying to be accurate. I had to look up how to spell sentence. Yes, I know that's horrible, but you see I'm a very phonetically spell, always have been, and so it's very  hard for  me to distinguish between the phonetically pronunciations of vowels. Like in the word sentence, I'm always unsure if it's sentence or sentence. Another example is that I used to spell ""they"" ""they"" because the e sounded like a long a to me. I better fix that if I'm going into government.  "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am overwhelmed with lots of work. Yesterday was very productive, and I intend for today to be the same way. I have no history to work on but I have to work on some Latin and some astronomy and go to a help session. I need to call Andrew and see if he wants to go see Thomas in College Station this Sunday. I hope he wants to do that because I want to be here on Saturday so that I can watch the football game in Austin and spend time with Matthew and study Saturday. I need to eat some lunch soon but I have some things I need to get done before that. The lawn mower outside is very annoying, and I hate that there seems to never be a good time of the day for people to mow lawns. Last year they would start the mowers at 7 when I was sleeping and it bugged the hell out of me. There is a party on 6th tonight that I might go to but I am not sure of that, because I don't really like the group of people that are going. I don't want Matthew to go to that party in North Austin because he will end up staying there, and that makes me uncomfortable. This guy is going to Acc and his parents are going out of town so he is having a party. That sounds a little bit like high school to me. The people I have met from ACC just don't seem to have work ethic and I just don't understand how someone could not want to try their best to get far. I have noticed that there are many people at this school that don't think twice when they speak up, thoughts are never concluded when people begin to speak. There is too much individualism, people only want to listen to themselves talk. We live in a society where people are obsessed with themselves. I find that in history very few people make educated assumptions when reading literature. They pawn off what the professor says and act like it is their own words. I  love Bob Dylan, people always ask him what his lyrics mean and he always just says "" oh, their just words"". Its great, I love it. I need to call my mommy today cause she called me last night, I saw this dog on campus today with its owner and it made me miss Emma at home. I love that dog, she is so cute, I swear she has human tendencies. I just miss coming home this summer and coming home to a dog that is so happy to see you. I love dogs so much, I can't wait to be able to have my own. Aww, my computer has been making the most annoying sound in the world lately, and I can't stand it, it is just this sound that keeps on going, never gets worse or better, it just lulls, and drives me crazy. I hate this place so much sometimes. there is too much estrogen in this building, and the fact that guys are only allowed on the weekends kills me. Why can't my brother come up here during the week, I just don't get it. It is so old fashioned. I understand they want it to be a learning environment conducive to studying, but millions of college kids live in places where sexes can mingle and people make their grades. yesterday felt like my true beginning of the semester. I had a full day of academics. I started around 8 and didn't finish till around 12, and I went to sleep so exhausted that I had no trouble falling asleep. But, I wake up in the morning with my back so sore. I don't know if all this work is just stressing me and giving me pains in my body, I don't know. I just know it isn't' from working out, cause I haven't done that in a while. I am perfectly fine with my appearance at the moment, I haven't gained any weight in a long time, and I don't want to let myself. Last year I gained like 5 pounds and I hated myself for it, but luckily I lost it. I need to take more pics and get that battery charged, it is annoying that my dad has that charger. I wont go home until Texas v ou so I won't get it until then, damn. I really want the fall to come, where the days are always in the 60's and 70's it is such beautiful weather, and no humidity so my hair doesn't go crazy on me. Arg, I just need to pace myself today, I don't want to be doing work late tonight, I want to finish around 8 or something, that would be nice. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     How much time do I have before I need to do some more homework. This week is going to be pretty busy. It is hard to find out what is due and when because their are way to many different places to find out. All the teachers should use the same service. This would make it much easier for students to keep up. My goal is not to fall behind, but I have missed some classes of geology. I need to find out what I missed. That class is going to suck. I wish I had a car so that I could get places farther than a mile away. I hate writing. I hate typing. It is hard to write down everything you think. Our minds work 5 or 6 times faster than one can type or speak. So if we could talk faster, we could get up to 5 times the amount of information to someone else, leaving us with more free time. This would shorten classes and anything that requires communicating. I'm glad my spider bite went away. It sucked that I had to go to the health center for it. They gave me a shot in my ass. It left a bruise, but it didn't hurt until an hour or so later. It just sucked that it was on my face. It made me nervous when I heard that corterzone lowers the immune system because I had been putting it on for many days. Thank god the over the counter medicine does not do harm. I spend much time alone now that I moved away. Luckily I enjoy being by myself. It is nice to have the peace and quiet. The parties are fun, it is just that I would prefer to chill with just my friends, not a million people that I don't know. I don't know too much about bull fighting, most other sports I have played. I do not see the glamour, passion, and joy of bullfighting. It seems barbaric to use ones instincts  "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well I am just sitting in my room on a rainy labor day, all my roommates are either out of town or napping so it's really quiet in here, which is actually really nice considering I hardly ever get alone time to just sit and think about stuff. Too bad that I have so much reading today and preparation for the bible study I will be leading for kappa that I have little time to rest I really have trouble relaxing once school starts up because I have so much going on that I feel guilty if I am not always being productive. I know that I need to take time every day just to sit with God and tell him what is going on in my mind. So that's what I want to do with this exercise I am going to type everything I think about but it is going to be in the form of a prayer to God. I hate that I feel like I constantly need to be watching my money, or what I eat, or anything else in my life that gives me a sense of control and like I am making wise decisions, why is it so hard for me to accept my screw ups? I know I human, and that I am sinful and that I can't do anything on my own. So I don't know why I get disappointed in my failures, why should I expect anything else??? I feel pretty guilty about how much time I put into some of my relationships as well, like I wish I was there for Lauren F. more and really was keeping up better with how she is doing and holding her accountable. Please give me the time and desire to talk to her and pray for her. I also really need your help in not letting the devil get a foothold in my thought life, I need you to make me aware of when I start to count calories (eaten or burnt!) or when I start to keep a constant tab on how much I spend or what people owe me. Lord I want to see every blessing in my life as a gift from you and not as something I deserve because I know that I do not!   I also know that I need to take a nap this afternoon if I want to get any work done later so I pray that I would be able to do that as well. I have so much stuff going on that it can really make me lose sight of what's important. YOU and my family and friends and everyone else in my life. Lord I want to see everyone in my life as a divine appointment. I feel really excited about this year but it's discouraging when I can already see myself getting caught up in the unimportant stuff. I really want to crawl into bed right now and get some sleep instead of finishing this assignment, but what can you do!  I hate that I was so irritable with my mom and dad this weekend and really hope that they can fix the problem they're having communicating, I am also so worried about David, MP, and Nancy, I just want them to see that all the worldly pleasures they are looking to escape the sadness of a broken home will never fill that void and that they desperately need to know you Lord, and understand your love for them. I wish I knew what to expect on this PHL test coming up on Thursday, but there I go again with wanting to know things before the right timing. I am worried that I am not studying for my classes as dedicatedly as I should be but I know that I am doing the best I can and they shouldn't be consuming my life. I am so glad I got to spend time with ford this weekend and I really hope that he doesn't have a flight delay because of the rain here and in Atlanta because I know he has a lot he needs to do when he gets back. But I know he was supposed to be here this weekend and I am so glad that he got to talk to Chris last night and really hope that he calls to tell me what they talked about. I feel a little anxious right now about getting all my work done today and for some silly reason I am really upset that the tuna fish I bought and that 7up drink turned out to be busts, because that cost what, maybe $4???? come on Louise you are so cheap get over it!!! surprisingly I am not really nervous about bible study tomorrow night but I know that I need to be really giving that to you and I really hope it doesn't all hit me at once tomorrow. I am really hot so I had to go turn on the fan. I wonder when becca and Martha are getting back, is it wrong that I kind of like that they aren't around right now? Why is it that I like to be alone so much, is it selfishness??? I am kind of worried about Kyle maybe liking me, I really don't want him to, because I really love having him as a friend and I really don't know what makes me think that he might want something more but for some reason I've been getting that vibe lately so I really hope that I can act in a way that doesn't lead him on but that is still nice. Man that 7up stuff I got is disgusting!!! why do I always try those things. Healthy soft drinks?!?! what a joke!!! of course it's going to taste awful. I really hate that I am always feeling like I need to be repaid when I do something for someone I mean seriously! why can't I just give out of love and show like grace like Christ did to us??? I am really excited about this PSYCH class though because it'll be cool to see if this is really the direction god wants me to go for my career. I am so glad to have this day off to rest and catch up in studies and for the 12 hours of sleep I got on Saturday I really need to get rest because I know I don't get nearly enough, help me allow more time for sleep and rest in my schedule because obviously you didn't make us require so much sleep for nothing! I just wish I would enjoy it I pray that I could have a peace so that I could sleep right now. "
Tell me about yourself.,     Man today was a really long day. I'm a so tired but I have all this crap to do still. mostly calculus. I don't know why I took 408D. its so freaking hard. I hope I'll do okay because I just have to. I signed up for tutoring but I don't know how much that'll help. I like this cd I'm listening to. I've listened to it a million times but still like it. man I'm really upset that alias isn't coming on this season. I love that show. It was one thing I was looking forward to this semester. I wish I could be like Sydney and kick butt. but instead I'm really boring. man I am so freaking tired. the bathroom has gotten really disgusting. I don't want to be the only one to clean it but I don't want to be the only one to complain that its dirty. I hate cleaning toilets. I mean it would be okay if it were at home because that's like our toilet and I kind of know the germs around. but this is used by four other girls and eeeeek I just can't think about it with out cringing. college is about cleaning bathrooms or learning how to. I guess I'll get used to it. Its going okay so far. I mean its fun and all but I don't know. I really really miss home. Its weird not coming home to your family everyday. I've met some really cool people but I still miss my old friends. but I'm getting used to going places by myself. Woo hoo I'm no longer a person that asks her friends to come with her to the bathroom. sheehs its only been 5 minutes. I don't know how much more I can type. This is a cool assignment not much thinking involved but wait haha I am typing what I am thinking so hey. my fingers are beginning to hurt from typing so much without stopping. Wait I missed my favorite song on the cd. Oh well. I wish asthma were here with me. We could do some awesome stuff together. but amrita seems really cool we've had great convos. but I'm still scared to make new close friends like I loved my friends from hs. We were such GOOD friends. Making new friends involves retrusting strangers and just starting over. Its hard for me I'm not one of those people who can socialize with anyone anywhere. I feel really  alone sometimes in a room full of people but I guess that's natural. wow its only been 8 min and 48 seconds. but I shouldn't complain  this is better than doing limits in calculus. lord calculus. I'm so worried I have to do good I have to. After this I should start some calc go over notes and then hwrk. tomorrow is discussion so it shouldn't be so bad. but I'm still worried sometimes the ta randomly calls on people to answer questions which isn't good when I'm totally clueless. Its embarrassing. but I guess I'm not the only one. Some people didn't know the answers either. The only thing is that in the class there's all these engineering majors completely engrossed in calculus they seem to understand everything. the class would be tons easier if I knew someone in there to help me. but there is morty. he's in a diff class but he says he'll help me. He's so freaking nice. he helps out a lot and hangs out with me even though I can be boring haha. I think he feels bad for me because I'm not adjusting as well as him to college. he's having like the time of his life . So many friends and places to go. I should keep my self busy so I won't get so lonely. I'm joining clubs and stuff but that makes me nervous. I want to run for office but its so scary for some reason. I have second thoughts about everything I have no idea why. I wonder where my roommate went. She works out everyday. Its inspiring I should too. I'll go to the gym. Haha I'll try who knows if I actually will. I went once and really liked it but I just have to find time. It seems like I have boatloads of work. but college is good. I'll get through it. I just don't know why people say its the best time of their lives. so far it just seems alright. Who knows I still have at least 4 years . I'm so sleepy. 5 more minutes of this and then calculus. No time to sleep. Ooh I need to watch RNC tonight. I missed last night but Laura bush was there. It might of been interesting even though I'm not much for republicans. everything lately is so political. its funny. in every class discussion there is some mention of elections. like in psychology the polls were really interesting. how people afraid of death are more likely to vote for bush. who knows if its actually true but I think there's some validity to it. sigh. I'm going home this weekend. I'm excited. I'm getting a ride from a stranger kind of so its weird. Haha that's what's cool about being Indian. parents can always find some other Indian kid to drive you home. oh well. I'm so tired there's only 2 minutes to go. This was actually cool and stress relieving. you know when you have so much on your mind its good to let it out. oooh asthma just imed me. I haven't talked to her in a while. damn she hangs out with matt Clark now. I find that to be so freaking funny. who would of thought? anyways man all I can think about is sleeping and dreaming haha I like dreaming lately I have weird dreams last time I had this nightmare 
Tell me about yourself.,"I have realized that my computer at home is a lot slower than my cool computer at school. I miss my computer at school, but at least this one does not have annoying pop-ups like that one. Ah! I am angry at Christina for downloading a stupid program onto my computer that had hidden programs. I am at home right now and I am happy, I miss being able to shower without shower shoes on. Everything is a lot more clean too, at least that is how I feel. I think that that's just because I am used to home. Oh my god my typing skills have deteriorated I think so have my spelling skills my head itches and I just washed my hair so now its dripping all over my shirt, because I am too lazy to blow dry my hair. speaking of which I need to bring my blow dryer to school so I don't sleep with wet hair because that gives me headaches. Today on the bus back home I was feeling nauseous hmm I do not think I spelled that right because I was reading my psychology reading hehe that's what I'm writing this essay for anyways I was feeling like I you know having to capitalize all the It's is very annoying and my weird keyboard is not helping very much either o yah so I decided to take a nap so I would not throw up. I miss my house. I hope tomorrow I will be able to hang out with my old friends who are still at home! many of them have left already except the ones going to west coast schools. lucky people they are, except they will still be in school in June when all of us are out! I told daddy about the Normandy scholar program that I was interested in, but I knew that he was not going to let me go or really try to apply. I think that my parents are way to protective of me sometimes, but I know it is for my own good because oh! I might get in some accident over there and they will not be able to help me, but seriously, if I get into a really bad accident there should be people in Europe who would help me by the way the Normandy scholar program is this thing where part of it you spend three weeks in Europe going to old world war II sites and you learn about world war II, which I think is interesting partially because I seem to be weirdly interested in wars and stuff, maybe that's why I like Ender's Game so much. but I also like band of brothers! which got me interested in world war II in the first place! and my favorite movie is black hawk down which is also kind of about a war, but more like a battle. I'm thinking about bringing my DVD's to school, but one they might not fit into my tiny suitcase and two they might distract me because I'll want to watch them instead of studying, like how my roommate and I stayed up until 2:30 for the past 2 nights watching Chinese soap operas. I think it's really funny because I am not really into girly stuff and the acting is so bad in these dramas but they sort of just suck you in and you have to finish watching them, like when you watch anime, speaking of which I need to see if the next Full Metal Alchemist episode is out or maybe I will just borrow it from my buddy. She's crazy but I like how she is protective of me. So I know that I hopefully won't get into any scary trouble! hehe it's like, now that I am away from my family at least I have someone I can trust to be there for me most of the time. I hope. I think. I don't know. maybe not that much. yea my hair is getting dry and now I have a piece of hair on my hand. I seem to be shedding a lot but I think that is normal because everyone else I have talked to say that it happens to them too. I just don't like how every time I wash my hair big wads of hair come out. I feel like I'm going bald, except I still have tons of hair, which makes me wonder how do I still have this much hair yet lose so much hair every time I wash my hair. because it takes a while for new hairs to grow as long as the old ones right? I wonder how much hair do we really have on our heads. I miss my sister and her friends this summer was really fun. even though I was only in California for about a week I really felt like I belonged there. It just seems so hard to go out and meet new people. I think I'm too shy around strangers. If I acted like myself when I'm with friends around people I don't know maybe it will be easier to make new friends. but I am afraid that eek I think I feel that I have a headache coming on. but I feel that I'll scare people away. But I mean if I'm going to be their friend they will eventually find out that that's the way I am right? I guess yay only about three more minutes to go. I think  my contacts are getting kind of foggy. I should blink more. I wonder do hard contacts yah they do but I think they get more dry quicker than soft contacts. I think they might be dirty but wouldn't that make my eyes hurt? maybe I don't know I always cringe when they fall into the sink! ew so gross. and to think that I'm putting these into my eyes everyday! I forgot to bring my sucker thing home just incase my contacts got stuck in my eyes. But I guess it's okay because I hope guess think they won't get stuck. so I didn't really forget I just say I did. it's kind of like I'm like a pathological liar then? I don't know it's just easier to say things and not have to explain them because then people get bored and are like ""why are you telling me this"" so I just lie to make it easier. I wonder if that's bad? like I remember the time that my friend called me really late at night and wanted to talk for no apparent reason. now my time is up!  "
Tell me about yourself.,"Ok, it's labor day. What a great day. Good thing because I needed to do a lot of homework. Geez, calculus is so easy but they give us too much homework. That baja place really sucked. That's not Mexican food at all!  It was way too expensive for the way it tasted. That dog commercial was funny!  I have been eating too much Domino's Pizza lately. I'm going to lose all my muscle and just get fat if I keep it up. Halo was awesome last night. 3 Hours for one mission!  That's crazy. But it was so much fun. That girl I met is so cool. She's different, and I like that. Hmm, if I try too hard she won't like that and she'll get scared off. If I don't try at all she'll think I don't like her. Girls are so freaking confusing. That chick had a guys name. Mr. Pennebaker is pretty cool and funny. I thought it was going to suck at first. Oh my god that psychology book is starting to get really hard to read. The next chapter talks about all the parts of the brain and I don't think my brain will be able to remember all that stuff. I wonder if that puppy turns girls off?  Hmm oh well if they don't like it I don't care. I should get more water because its starting to run out. Is weed really that bad?  Hmm,  why do so many people do it?  I don't know but I don't think it's that bad. Alcohol is probably worst and that's legal. My hand is starting to hurt and it's only been like 6 minutes. I miss my car. It was so freaking fast. Going 125 on the highway was freedom. Now I'm really stressed out and don't know how to relieve it. I want to play halo again. I'm going to try to call her again in like an hour. I hope she isn't too busy. Man I should just wait for her to call me,  what if she starts hating me for trying too hard. I want to eat McDonalds later on. And some ice-cream. Damn, then I have to go run for an hour. Why am I starting to hate that. It used to be my favorite thing to do. Well probably because there are so many better things to do here. Church was ok. The singing and piano were freaking awesome!  It was a little boring though. Mass in Spanish is better for me. I have to go look for one soon. That'll be better. If god doesn't exist that would suck. That means when we die we just die. We can't dream anymore, we can't think, or do anything. We just don't exist. I can't even imagine that. Because when I am sleeping I am still thinking. What would it feel like to no longer be in existence?  Well you wouldn't really feel anything. I'm answering a lot of my own questions. Why does Pennebaker want us to do this. He has his professional degree. He must be pretty damn smart. Maybe he is studying us every time we go into his class. I miss my dog. I hope he is in doggy heaven now. I hate cats, why don't they like me. Hey it's Robert,  I'm going to go answer the door. Ok lets turn on the TV. Only 8 minutes left. pp pp shee pp pp shee. He's busting a beat it sounds pretty good. I like coke better than Pepsi. How can anybody not like Adam sander. He is so funny and so is that guy on that god movie. what was it called. Hmm. Hmm. Oh yeah Bruce almighty. what was his name. Ace Ventura no that isn't it. Hmm. Oh Yeah JIM  Carrey. he is funny too. Old but funny. Wow will smith looks good for him being so old and all. I want to keep looking that young when I get old. Music is awesome. I've learned so much about what I like since I've gotten here. I think I'm going to learn a lot about myself in this college. I'm glad I got accepted. Actually I like that I got that full scholarship. Man mad TV is funny. they are really good actors. I hope people don't think they are losers because it is really hard to keep a straight face and act so well. We are going to go eat again. Yummy!  I hope it is like a burger place or something. Kinsolving food is pretty good. The people there are also really  nice. That black guy is hilarious. He is really friendly too. I wonder when I have to take that test for the business school. I think I failed it the last time I took it. GOD she is so pretty. Both of them. Why are girls like that. Why do they lead you on. Even now she is leading me on. Is the new girl my girlfriend now?  We do everything that couples do. we go out in public together and everyone has seen us. Does that make us an Item?  Maybe. I'm not sure if I want a girlfriend here in college. But the companionship of a female is really good. Having a good girlfriend is hard to find. I hope that girl I met last week will be good friends with me. I can learn so much from her. But she is too attractive and it'll be really hard for me to just be friends with her. I've already kissed her. She let me, so what does that mean?  Maybe just friends that think they are attractive. She probably did mean that she doesn't want a boyfriend. Well girls are so confusing. 20 minutes up, time to go eat. Later "
Tell me about yourself.,"adrian is rather BORING to talk to. I called him first and he didn't even seem the least bit surprised or even thankful. nice. ""oh abby. you're so BEEEYOOOTIFUUUL and so PPEEEERRRRRFECT!!"" I bet he likes the attention he gets from imbuing someone adoration. maybe that's the exact reason why I'm attracted to him. I'm attracted to the fact that I'm attracted. isn't that completely vain?? and shallow too. I am ashamed. maybe I can't control it. it just doesn't happen everyday that someone at least pretends to like you for such exaggeratingly good qualities. I feel bored. I do not want to read 50 pages of some stuff I can't concentrate on while listening to the TV. even if its TV stuff that I don't want to hear. I'm listeninng to music. finger 11. not anymore. I miss caleb, jacob, pinky, ed, michelle, michael, mom, dad, janie, cesar, cynthia, everything is SO DIFFERENT from just only 5 years ago. we all used to be so close together. geographically and familiarly. I think this assignment is cool. all our writing assignments should be like this. the experiment I participated in last week was really boring. I thought it would involve something interesting like tasting some product or doing something physical like a handstand and see how gravity affects blowflow to certain body parts. THAT would be a cool experiment. it could help those poor astronauts and their whatever space effects. HUH!! they should be helping poor homeless people off the streets. its got to be somehting psychological about that because I mean. people could work if there's nothing physical impeding them. Hten it must be mental or emotional or ptsd. my cousin, michelle, said I almost gave her ptsd. post traumatic something disorder. I thought that was funny. I wish I had an awesome sense of humor to make people and myself laugh all the time. all I can do is act like my stupid self and that makes people laugh because I'm so naive or ignorant and oblivious to something. what kind of. ok. what REALLY FREAKIN bothers me about the Church's doctrine is the frenching thing. its been bothering me for a long time. probably longer than it should. man, not EVERYONE goes straight to copulation after they french. yeah, it may arouse the man. or woman, but not really. surely not. I don't see WHY we can't until we're married. its showing AFFECTION. gets to know the other a bit more I guess. I don't understand. no comprendo!!! I  like my immortal by evanescence. evanescence is a COOL name. its a sad song though. I wish I could just not have ANY expectation about guys liking me so when one finally does, finally LOVES me, then I'll be surprised and it'll really reallly realllllly count. I get so Disatisfied. I want to go to rome, paris, england, switzerland, russia, romania, I want to speak all their languages!!!!! but look here. there's no FUNDING no TIME for learning all of them. I wish I could feel the ever ""playful Presence"" like in Dean Koontz's book ""One Door Away From Heaven. "" AWESOME BOOK. I've got to do chemistry and finish my calculus. CALCULUS IS FUUUUUUN!!!! the ta is cool but I DO NOT know what he tries to say when he teaches!!!!! he would've been a REALLLLLLY CUUUUUUUUTE guy if he wasn't gay. tooooo baaaad. I do not agree with homosexuality. takes away from the beauty, sanity, naturality, rightness, sanctity of humanity and the world. I ain't never lookin back, and that's a fact. I've got pride I'm taking it for a ride. I liketat song. I like tiers, I'd like a really tiny tier for a pet. that'd be soooooooo fun and not to mention cooooool. dr. moreau should have created mini-creatures for the future. my time is almost up. htis was a cool assignment. I had a cup of noodle soup. I'm really full. I feel like I don't have to eat for 3 days. maybe I should try that. see if I'm a SURVIVOR. I don't think I'd DIE from that 3 day fast. people stay around for longer without food. I wish they didn't have to. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     I'm thinking about what I need to do before classes start again, but every time I  get started, something interrupts me or I just don't feel like doing it. I'm sitting in my  room in front of my awesome new computer listening to the 'Wicked"" soundtrack,  it's amazing. my room smelled before, but I cleaned the kitchen so now it doesn't  smell anymore. stacy just walked in my room and I yelled at her because I am not  supposed to be disturbed during my writing assignments. I'm feeling kind of gross,  actually. I feel gross because it's the end of the weekend and I was out partying  the whole time. I hate when people are like, ""yeah I party"", but I seriously did the  whole weekend. now I feel dirty and gross. I also ate like crap this whole weekend. ew. during the week I'm so healthy and so conscious of what I eat, and then the  weekend comes and it's like I've never seen food before. what is that about? so  now I feel gross because I feel like I ate the entire state of texas and I'm disgusting. I'll get over it. I kind of miss camp right now, even though I would never go back. I  miss sam israel and hilly and weisberg. those three are like my favorite people in  the world. this time seems to be going by so slowly. I feel like I've been writing  forever and I haven't. weird. so back to camp. I miss it because I was so  comfortable and so happy. here, I'm not used to everything yet. and I miss those  three girls because I know that they will always be there and I've known them  forever. I'm still getting to know people here, which is fun because I love to meet  new people, but sometimes I long for that feeling of comfort and not having to  impress or look good for anyone. you know what I mean? and I also miss adam. this is something I could talk about for a while but I don't really know if I want to. it's  our 4 year anniversary in a couple of days but the card and present that I sent him  won't get there on the 8th, I feel kind of bad about that. what can I do? it was so  weird when ross called me the other night, what the f? I'm running out of things to  talk about. I love traci, my suitemate. I knew her from camp and I'm really glad we  decided to live together. despite what everyone said, I knew it would be a good  decision. we've been getting along really well. I'm thinking about ""friends"" right  now because it's my favorite show. I love it so much, and I'm so sad that it's over. but I'm excited to watch ""joey"" on Thursday. I'm definitely going to support him even if  the show sucks, though I doubt it will. this is random but I'm going to run out of soap  and shampoo soon, I'm going to have to go to eckerd's to buy more, and I need to  return some books to the co-op outlet because there were some books that I didn't  need. hopefully I'll get store credit, and then I can buy some stuff. that would be  awesome! I need to return my chemistry and old psychology book. I found out that  I was in the chemistry class for science majors, and let me tell you that I'm the  furthest thing from a science major. I hate science. well I don't hate it but I definitely  don't belong in that class. so I switched into chemistry in context which is for sure  more my pace. and I actually swtiched into this class after classes had started and  I found out that I bought the wrong book. I just figured something out about me. I  hate bad spellers. so random, I know, but I see myself typing and every time I'm  about to spell something wrong or I mistype, I get so angry. I don't know how  people can just leave words mispelled. I hope nobody reads this because they'll  think I'm such a weird kid. which I am, but not everyone needs to know that. my  brother, danny, always tells me I'm a weird kid. he's so funny. and whenever I talk  about him to other people, they always ask how old he is, and then they are  surprised when I tell them that he's 16, because the way I talk about him, it sounds  like he's older. danny always gives me orders and bosses me around, but in a  funny way, not in a serious way. people always make fun of our family by calling  us the ""brady bunch"" because  no one ever seems to fight in my family. I don't  know why, but we all just get along. my older sister is my best friend in the entire  world. sure, we get annoyed with each other every once in  a while, but she is  absolutely the first person that I go to with a problem and she's the first person I tell  things to. and danny is awesome. there's nothing not to like about him. he's so  cute, nice, smart, funny, he's a great catch. some day, girls are going to fall all over  him. they should. me and andi (my sister) always say that we would date danny if  he wasn't our brother. he's such a cute kid. I'm kind of mad at him though because  I haven't talked to him in a really long time and he said that he would call me and  he didn't. I hate when people do that. I really don't know what else to talk about. I  guess I can go through my high school friends and talk about them because then  I'll have plenty to say. I hope that's still following the assignment. so I'll start with  olivia geyelin. I don't even know why I'm writing about her because she sucks. I  mean, I hate this girl. she might be the dumbest person I know, and she's always  complaining and never knows what's going on. she gets mad at everyone for the  dumbest reasons. ew. but I kind of feel bad for her because she's got the worst  family life ever. ok I'm sick of olivia, now I'll talk about rikki spreckman. ok, I used to  love rikki, she was so sweet and nice and always smiling. and then I realized how  selfish and dumb she was. I hate sounding like a bitch but I' m starting with the  people I like the least and working my way to the good ones. ok so rikki, sweet girl,  adorable, but so dumb. and she's best friends with hillary, who I'll come back to  later, but it annoys me because hillary's one of my best friends and I hate how  much time they spend together. I'm not jealous, I just know that hillary could do so  much better than rikki, but rikki seems to need hillary. and I feel bad for hill  because a lot of people don't like rikki, and so they're always talking about her and  then people assume that because hill is so close with her that she sucks too,  which is so not true. but I've known rikki since junior high. ok now on to sarah  salon. I used to hate sarah. she's a bitch. not kidding. and she's intimidating as  hell, but only if you take her seriously. now I like her a lot more because I'm not  scared of her and I don't take her shit. she has two older sisters who might be the  meanest people ever, and she tries to act like them but she's so much better than  them. sarah had a boyfriend for a really long time, and so her and I were always  able to have really great conversations about boiyfriends and relationships. she's  always so much fun to be around. I like her. but her and rikki had this whole feud  going for a while and all she would do was talk about rikki and how much she  hated her. I'm wondering if this timing thing is accurate because I really feel like  I've been doing this forever and every time I'm typing, it seems like the seconds  don't go by, but every time I pause, the seconds go by quickly. maybe it's in my  head, I don't know. but it's weird. I'm going to start looking at another clock to see  how much time has gone by. ok after sarah, I only have favorites left. everyone  else left, I genuinely love, they're my best friends. I'll start with lizzie albert. Elizabeth Chandler Albert. I met lizzie freshman year and we were instantly best  friends. I'm not kidding, I loved her so much and we could always talk about  anything and laughed so much together it was ridiculous. and we were always on  the same intellectual level because we were pretty much the same (but she was  smarter). in our group of friends, we were the smartest. we were bff, I swear and  then junior year, our friends kind of got in this fight and we didn't talk for a really  long time. it really bothered me. I'm not joking. it killed me that she didn't want to  talk to me and I didn't understand. it was so bad. we were never the same again. but at the end of senior year, we got close again, and now I think we're really  close, like reverting back to three years ago. I miss her so much, she goes to  wisconsin. she's probably having the best time. I can't wait to go visit her. she's so  funny, I always have a great time whenever I'm with her. Love her. ok after lizzie  comes simone. I met simone actually a long time ago. Maybe in 1997. she came  to camp and we were good friends, we were in the same cabin. then she stopped  going to camp and I didn't see her again until I was in high school. then we  became best friends. I LOVE simone. she cracks me up and is so great. we finish  each other's sentences, she reminds me of my mom so much, she's like another  sister to me. we took this class together called 20th century history and literature,  and it was the best class that I have ever taken. I'm so glad that we were able to be  in that class together. I hate sounding cheesy but it's true. there's no one I'd rather  be in 20th with than simone. simone's dad died the day before her 5th birthday,  and so she lives with her mom. she has two sisters, so the four girls are pretty  close. her mom works all the time so I feel like simone's ahead of all of us, she's  already an adult. she does things by herself and is really mature. love her. she  goes to bradley which is so good for her. I really hope she's happy. she rocks my  world. after simone comes marisa. LOVE marisa. we always knew each other but  weren't really friends until about sophomore year. then the end of junior year and  all of senior year we were like inseperable. we were best friends. me, simone,  lizzie and marisa were a foursome. she's so funny, so sweet, loooooves to talk. I  love her family and going over to her house because I always have a good time  when I'm there. marisa was the kid who was on the fast track, if you know what I  mean. she had sex when she was 12 or 13, had a cell phone before everyone,  never really had any rules. Which the exact opposite of me. but she's great and I  love her. she has parties and her house is always the one we go back to after  dances and stuff. marisa and I went to breakfast every Saturday morning of our  senior year. that makes me so sad that I don't get to do that anymore. she goes to  indiana, and she loves it. both her parents went there and loved it. her mom was  president of aephi there, so she won't have any problems getting into the sorority. marisa goes with the flow, she's not uptight or anal about much. she's actually  underrated anal but I won't tell anyone about that. love her. and last, I'll talk about  Hillary. I love her. I've known her since the early days at camp marimeta. she was  always the little girl that everybody loved. we didn't become friends until we were  older and then became like best friends junior and senior year. she' so great. I  honestly love her and miss her so much. she wanted to go here so badly and  didn't get in. Ass holes. but I don't think she would have come here anyways. I can  talk to hillary about everything. I love her. she goes to illinois. I can't wait to go visit  her. she's so fun and we'll have the best time partying, but I also can't wait to just  talk with her and lay on her bed. she's so funny and a great person to be with. we're very similar in a lot of ways and I just think that she's great. the first time I  came to visit texas she came with me. and we were on poms together. She was  even my big sister one year. I miss poms. and I miss hill, I need to call her actually  because I miss her so much. she's so cute and so talented. she's the best dancer  ever and she has a really great voice but she doesn't really sing anymore. sometimes I make her sing to me, but she doesn't sing for a lot of people. ok so  now that I only have about a minute left I can talk about adam. adam jeffrey silver. I  met the kid the first day of high school. I was like, damn he's hot. we were in like 3  classes together and our last names are close so we sat next to each other. we  exchanged phone numbers, he asked me to homecoming and we dated ever  since. he's my best friend in the entire world. he knows me better than even I know  myself and more than my sister knows me. he's so special to me and I know that  I'm in love with him and that I will always love him. I miss him so much. sometimes  I don't' know what to do with myself because I miss him so much but I know it's the  right thing to be with other people right now. how else are we supposed to know if  we're really right for each other? this is the time to find out , you know? well, it's  been great. see you later "
Tell me about yourself.,"At this very moment I feel anoyed and somewhat angry at what I see everyday. For example, there was a notice on my apartment door that I read after coming home from school. It stated that there was a homicide in the apartment complex. about 3 days ago there was another notice that warned about an armed robbery nearby. When I ride the Ut shuttle busses to school, I notice that now a days there is no sense of courtesy, nobody thanks the driver and students don't even bother to notice traffic when crossing streets. everyone is too caught up in their own little worlds to even show some form of humane decency. I don't know why I get angry when I think of this, maybe I pay too much attention to things I shouldn't. I have always disliked people but loved individuals, but what can be done to improve or avoid ignorence bbut to simply choose not to act irrational. enough of that. Now I am beggining to think of all the things I must do. I feel rather confused because I don't know if I should quite my job. It is not easy at all to be a full time student and work over 30 hours a week as a waiter at Antonios Tex Mex. On top of that, I just moved from apartment complexes, and I have not completely finished orginizing my stuff at my new apartment. There is an empty Burger King bag infront of me and I feel guilty. You see about 1 year and 5 months ago, I used to be very fit, I mean I had it all. I'm 6 ft. tall, and during that time, I weighed about 200 lbs but out of pure muscle, I was scorching hot. That is around the time I meat my girlfriend (I hope you don't think this is cheesy) and so we got together; about five months passed, and I just ballooned into 265 lbs. The reason I stated earlier that I felt guilty for eating the burger was because I am trying to get back in shape. And I also feel bad because I know that my partner worries about my health. But I do get satisfaction and happiness due to the choices I've made in my life, I chose to stay in school and never do drugs, also I have a person who has been with me in great times as well as tough times, and has had love for me in my horrible looking days as much as in my good looking days.       "
Tell me about yourself.,"     hello professor, I'm doing your little writing assignment even though I have no clue what to write so Ill do what you said to do and wirte about anything that comes to my head. today I have to do a lot of study work, not much else to do b. C I lifted weights and played bball yesterday for bout 6 hours and now I'm in the UT cycling team and its pretty damn cool. I should excel in this sport because I know how to push my body harder than anyone I know, no matter what the test I always push my body harder than everyone else. I want to be the best no matter what the sport or event. I should also be good at this because I love to ride my bike and to do it as a sport? wow lots of fun. music. hmmm I like it a lot, I have lots of it in fact I have about 15 GB of music on this computer which is about 5,000 songs so I have a wide variety of music and that's good to have, its also good to have know a lot of things which is exactly what I do, I know lots of stuff that nobody else would know. I am extremely good at jeopardy and I usually have as much money as the winner and the funny part about it is, they have had college and lots of schooling, most of the contestants were graduate students and I have just begun college. by the way my classes are in no way difficult, I hope your class doesn't get hard because I have a a lot of calculus which isn't hard, just very time consuming. what to write, haha now that I ask an opportunity has presented itself, a girl that I know just said hi, got me some of that last weekend, I've known her all my life and she looks pretty good too, she goes to tarleton(redneck city) but its ok, its still good. I have a way with people, if I can talk to them for about 10 minutes I can get them to really like me and if I want to I can make them do almost anything(no alchohol has to be used). you can ask my best bud who goes to school here, he knows that I have a way with people and I do that's what's so cool about this. I have a great life ahead of me and I want to live it to the fullest and no matter what I say on here I can't stop typing so I will continue and the music is great by the way damn I've got to go home this weekend, everyone misses me too much although I don't miss any of them except this girl that I went out with for bout 2 years, lots of fun there, I love her yes I do and she loves me but since I left we broke up and now she's trapped with a druggie b. C if she dumps him he will either kill himself or me so she's very scared but I don't care, it will all work itself out in time I just hope it won't take forever. my calculus teacher is skin a real social reject, he has no body mass, he is skinnier than a toothpick and his clothes almost fall off of him its funny to look at that finish button is looking really good right now, as in extremley good, I wish I could click it right now but I can't b. C my 20 isn't finished yet so I will continue in my efforts to type and type continuously like you wanted, geez 20 minutes is a long time to just type and have nobody type back to you although I have writted letters that have taken me 3 hours to write and consisted of about 10 pages of paper, but I don't care, I don't care about much anyways, just my grades got to keep them up, I care about my family my future and the girl back home, I care about my frineds, I care about my physical health and looks that's why I love to be in shape but other than that, I don't care about much of anything, there is no reason to care and by the way I SUPPORT BUSH he is a good man and if the media didn't give him such a hard rap about things people would like him a lot more the only reason many people don't is because of the media, I even ask them why they don't like him and all they can say is just because, I reeally wisht tthat they would take the time to research things and see who the btter candidate for the president is which is obviously BUSH!!! anyways I don't really liek the music that is playing right now its not really that cool and has no good beat at all, music is a beautiful artform wchich I believe is the best ever but who cares? nobody. I am out to change the world and I will you will see  --Mad Hatter--out "
Tell me about yourself.,"I believe in the future of agriculture, with a faith born not of words, but of deeds. Better days through better ways. That's all of the Creed to the FFA I can rememeber, although I had to recite it for many times. I feel somewhat out of place in my apartment with 4 other room mates because I pay the least rent but I have the most disposable income. I'm not sure if I spell a lot of words incorrectly because I'm dyslexic. I will say that by typing, my spelling improves. My hand writing is horrible. I can bearly read the things I write. I've worked out deals with most all of my teachers in the past about letting me take assignments home and write them. Man, this room is hot. I just turned on the fan but it's still way too hot. I want to take guitar and speed reading classes. Those are two areas of my life in which I think I drastically need improvement. Although, none of which are pertinent to my life right now. I supose the speed reading class might be. I'm so far behind in my readings for all my classes, I don't want to start. Twenty minutes is a long time to write about nothing. I wonder how many books have started, or been intirely written with not forthought what so ever going into the plot. I had a dream I thought should be a book the other night, but I can't remember it. My memmory has been getting worse daily. Not just because of the alcohol consumption. I think I'm acutally drinking less now than I did in high school. I'm feeling an excess load of self inflicted stress lately, and I think it should get a little worse in the next coulpe days and then a lot better. My girl friend of over a year and a half and I broke up a couple weeks ago, but continued to date. The part that bothers me is that I don't have the same free time as she does, so all my free time still goes to her, but she's dating other people. I told her today that I wanted to sever ties for 3 weeks and see how that goes. She's totally against it, and if I were her, I would be too. She still has the comanionship of her 1st and longest boyfriend, and can date other people on the side. One of which is the same age as my 23 year old brother who is a huge reason we broke up in the first place. I feel this pain inside me I've never felt before when I hear her talking about going places with him. But like my roommate says, there's nothing like a good jam secion. He's talking about music, but I want to jam with some other girls. Get my mind off of her. I know that the migranes and headaches are from her, and that she really is being selfish most of the time, and she's not really my ""type,""  if there is a type for anyone. But I find myself unable to stop thinking about her. I met another girl the other day who has more incommon with me than anyone I've ever met. She's beautiful and got into UT. That means brains and beauty. She's just coming off of a break up from her long time boyfriend through high school as well. My main hesitation about persuing her is that I don't want either of us to mentaly, or physically, get involved just because we think we need someone at the moment. Besides, I think she's too active for me. she's the social director of her sorority. Another thing that's been stressing me out is the fact that my cholesterol is 253, and my LDL (the bad kind) is 183, higher than most people's total. The doctor told me I needed to get on medication as sooon as possible and gave me sample packages that should last me atleast a month to be sure I had time to get my perscription filled. My first thought was to get a second opinion about the medication, but I feel confident that any doctor would tell me the same thing. I would tell someone the same thing and I don't have a degree. But I can't convince my self to take it. No studies have been done to document the sideeffects of the medication on someone as young as my self. When I asked the Doctor about them, she said that I should just take half the recomended dosage and I should be okay. I decided against the medication and I've drastically changed my eating habbits, althought I didn't think they were that bad to begin with. I've never been out of shape persay, but I can tell my body's getting back into shape. I used to be very fit, but after quitting high school sports my junior year, I began to slack off. And I found the girl that I just recently broke up with, so doing workout stuff didn't compare to her. I think I'm going to start running soon. I'm lifing now more then I get my cardio up, and while it's helping my muscles get back to looking right, I don't think it's giving me the help that I need. We, the people in my apartment, have decided, because of me, to each by their own groceries. I was tired of paying for all the stuff they eat when I wouldn't have any of it. I was buying all my stuff extra anyway, and they still wanted me to pay 25 bucks a aweek for ""community food""  looks like my time is up. Adios         "
Tell me about yourself.,"     Usually when you know that you have to do something, you usually think about that something, you usually think about that something and wonder, ""How am I going to do it?  Where do I start?  Where do I finish?  How do I know that I am doing it right?""  This is my situation exactly with this writing assignment. Its the middle of the week and the weekend is almost here. I can't wait till Saturday because I will attend the first UT football game this season, which I might add, will be my first time to attend one. The weeks go by so slow in the fall semester compared to when I was up here for summer school. Its a real drag. I'm always so tired I hate it. Labor day is this weekend, really looking forward to the four day weekend and getting some time to rest. Maybe I'll go visit Brett (an El Paso friend) at the hidious A & M, College Station, the drive is a drag though. The road trip that me and Lianne went on last weekend to go visit up there was sort of fun, but people down there are really rude and it just bugs the hell out of me. All they're concerned about is putting UT down or ""TU"" as they call us since we're not ""THE"" University of Texas but ""A"" Texas University!  Isn't it stupid. Still admit I'm upset about them breaking the horns of my longhorn emblem on my car. Its sad how immaturity can get the best of people. They do have a lot of school spirit. Makes me wish that I was into that stuff. Who knows, maybe when all the football games start. I want to see how crazy us Longhorns really get. I can't wait till softball games start, I want to see all their home games to see what it takes to be on the team!!  Hopefully next year, after a lot of hard work and practice to get back into it, I will be ready to try out. I'm really discouraged about trying out this year, I know I'm not ready. My family's encouragement helps but I don't want to make a fool out of myself. I can just imagine being out on the field suited out in a UT uniform. How amazing. That is my goal!!  If I can be one of the best players in my city, why wouldn't I have a shot on the team. I just think that I lack a lot of skill to be playing at the university level. It may be outstanding for high school, but college ball is a totally different game. I love being away from home to go to school, there is so much more freedom. Don't have to be home at a certain time, don't have to check in. I love it. There are a lot more responsibilities though, but I'm picking up on the time management. The Incubus concert is coming up and I'm (since yesterday) going. I've only heard a few songs by them so I can't say that I'm an ""all out"" fan of theirs. But hey I'm open to the experience, it's going to be my first real concert. I should really save my money, but hey, why not just do it. Its worth the experience. "
Tell me about yourself.,"So. I am overwhelmed. I wouldn't say that I'm completely overwhelmed and feel like crying, but I feel a little stressed out. I am not used to all this studying and it's proving to be a little harder than I thought. So much reading. It seems like it will never end. I feel like I will never be caught up. I have to read so many pages for all of my classes except math. I was worried about math but so far, it's my easiest class. Well, I guess it's good that it's not hard too. My classes aren't really difficult but there is just so much reading. I'm scared about the first test that I will take. I'm afraid that I'm going to make a really bad grade and maybe even fail it. I would be devestated. So, I'm trying to study a lot. It feels like I am studying a lot but I guess I won't know if it's all sufficient until that first test. Man, this is going pretty slow. It's only been three and a half minutes. Only 17 more to go. Well, this is the easiest writings that I've had to do so far. Just write exactly what is going through my head. Can't be that hard. Me and my roommate had our first disagreement last night. I promised her that I wouldn't smoke a cigarette at this party and then she caught me taking a drag. I felt really bad about lying to her. Yeah, I was drunk but it was still wrong. So, this morning I told her that I was really sorry and blah blah blah. She said that it was cool and everything but I don't want it to change our friendship. I still want her to be able to trust me. I know that it's just a stupid little fight but it really scares me that she might never trust me like she used to. I guess that it will all work out for the best. I love Austin so much. It's an awesome place to be. There are so many good places to eat and shop and just look at. My home town only has about 1000 people in it. So Austin is a good change for me. But I do miss my parents and my bed and my shower. Man, these beds in Jester suck. I wake up and I'm sore. So, I hurt my ankle pretty bad about a week ago. We're suing the 7-11 that I tripped at because they handled the situation really badly and treated me very rudly. My roommate, Dana, was awesome throughout it all. I really couldn't have done it without her. I'm glad that we don't hate eachother. But I hope that I get some money from the 7-11. It would be nice to be able to pay for an apartment next year with out having to get my parents to pay for it. They have 3 kids in college at the same time so it's going to be a tough year for them, financially. Dana treats guys really weird. I would say, wrong, but it's just different than I treat guys. She's so wishy washy and is like cheating on all of her boyfriends. It kind of bothers me but if that's the way she is, I can't try and change her or preach to her about how I think she should be acting. Man, if my other papers were this easy to write, I would have so much more time on my hands. I'm only taking 12 hours, so I feel like a slacker. The thing is that if I were taking any more, I think I might cry a lot more. When will the reading ever end?!?!?! Only 8 more minutes to go. Wow, this is easy. Our dorm room used to be freezing cold but I taped some paper over the vent which made it a lot better. It's pretty ghetto looking, but it works. I haven't been able to exercise for a long time. I have to wait until my ankle is better. I can't even wear tennis shoes yet! Man, I feel so lazy and fat when I don't work out. Exercising makes me feel good! Damn that 7-11! And I bought a Texercise pass too! I'm losing some money there. I have handicap parking but it runs out on Wednesday. It's been really handy! Bont, that's a word that my ex-boyfriend made up when he was in 7th grade. I've tought it to a lot of people here and everybody loves to say it. It makes me so happy when I hear my new UT friends say it because it reminds me of the good things about home. And it reminds me of Matt too. So, I love to hear a good ole' bont every once in a while. The girls next door are really loud sometimes and I don't think that they like me. They've been really bitchy so far and that bums me out because I like to get along with everybody. There is this guy a few doors down from me and he's really cool. We like the same music and movies and all that good stuff. He's kind of crazy though. But I like crazy sometimes. Aren't we all a little crazy? But he's not that attractive, he's kind of a big guy. But, I've seen pictures of him when he was in high school and he was really cute. It bothers me that this bothers me. I'm not the type of person who judges others, especially by the way they look. It's not even like I'm judging him. I just think that we get along really well but I would probably never date him and it bothers me to think that I'm that vain. But I'm really just rambling and none of this makes sense very much. I know how I'm feeling, but when I try to write it, it doesn't come out right. Oh well. At least I know what I feel. Or at least, I think I know.        "
Tell me about yourself.,"     I went to church tonight. It makes me feel very calm and relaxed. It puts the world into such a different perspective. Everything seems so simple. It makes me want to be a much better person. The television is on. I think it's on MTV. I'm not watching it though. That's annoying song on that commercial. I don't want to go back to school on Tuesday. I have a lot of work to do including reading for this class. I can't wait till Friday. I get to go home, and my boyfriend is coming in town. I hate commercials. I don't like eating college food. I really miss not having to worry about going out and getting something to eat. My roommate went home for the weekend. It's weird being here alone. I have been going to sleep late this weekend. I turned off the TV. I went to the football game last night. It was fun. There was a lot of drunk people there though who snuck in alcohol. It makes me almost think that they should just sell beer at the games so people wouldn't sneak it in. It's very quiet. I want to join clubs here. I really want to volunteer at like a pregnancy help center. I want to make a difference that way. I'm really hungry so I am eating burnt popcorn. I will prob. make some more after I finish this. I don't know what the point of this is. I think it's a cool assignment, but I wonder what it is going to show about the way I think. I want my boyfriend to call. I miss him a lot. I saw my friends today. I bought sandals with a little brasilian flag on them. They are really cute. My boyfriend is from Brasil. It just occurred to me that I'm not sure if you spell that county with a s or a z. I'm a horrible speller. The tower was so pretty last night. I think it is my favorite part of campus. I look at it everyday, and it reminds me that anything can be accomplished if you put your mind to it. I love it. I like how you can see the capitol building too at the same spot by the tower. They're just really cool. I think I hear one of my suite mates. She went to visit her boyfriend in San Marcus. I wish my boyfriend was closer. It's hard having him so far away. I know everything will work out though because I love him so very much. Wow. I can't wait till Friday. It was really cool visiting him in Michigan. My dad's birthday is coming up on the 26th. That is also Luis and I's 5 month anniversary. Wow. that's a long time. I want to marry him. That may sound weird. too soon or whatever. But it's true. I never thought I would find someone so amazing. He told me that he wants to marry me someday. I wish that I could fastfoward college sometimes so we could be together again. I went to this meeting on studying abroad on Friday. It was pretty boring. It was interesting how many countries you can go to. I want to do that one day. That would be fun to experience another culture. I mean I've been to Europe before but only for a couple of weeks. Not long enough to learn about it in-depth. I have noticed how dead it is on campus on the weekends. It's kind of sad. Especially this weekend. I'm surprised how many people left. I love the picture of my baby next to my printer. He's so adorable. He makes me feel so special. I'm thirsty. Why isn't my boyfriend calling me? I love the sound of his voice. I forgot that I wanted to call my mom today. I wanted to tell her about the game and find out about Bridgette. I hope she is alright. The priest at church prayed for the people in Florida. I'm happy that Carmen goes to church now. My friend once told me that she didn't believe in God. I hope she does now. I almost started crying in church because I was so happy. I like when my boyfriend goes to church with me. He's such a better person now that he's going out with me. It's amazing how much he's changed. He stopped drinking. Not that he won't have a sip every once in a while, but before he would drink every weekend. He wouldn't get drunk but still he would drink a lot. I want to talk to my friend ben. He's at LSU. Wow. 20 minutes is a long time. I can't believe I'm still writing. It's getting pretty boring. I don't know what else to think about. I miss my nephews they are so cute. I don't see how anyone could ever have an abortion. That's so incredibly sad. I hope I can help put an end to abortions one day. It makes me sick just thinking about it. I really don't like analynn. Goodness she is very mean and fat. I'm glad that I never have to see her. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I need to get out more. I work all the time and go to school, and leaves so little time forme. Both of my parents a sick and living at home was kind of already planed. It makes you a stronger person to get stuck doing the stuff I do, but I wonder what it would be like to be normal. What it would be like to be selfish or not even selfish,but to not have so many people relie on me. I want to meet boys and just hang out, but I'm so shy. I think I look ok, but is ok enough? I'm 22 years old and one guy has approched me with saying something to make me mad. A lot of my frinds insted of being happy for me are so negative. We are no dating, I've never been on a date, so should be single for ever. I miss steven, but should I he's been sent overseas probably to fight. I only knew him for a few days and then he got his orders to leave. He gave me his phone number, but I can't call him. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     Well, this is interesting. Let's see. right now, I feel like I'm not even doing homework, really. Sarika, Mary and Natasha are quizzing each other on medical terminology, which seems so much more. studious than what I'm doing. But I don't mind. Let's see. my hands have been smelling kind of funny. Like rust, almost. But I haven't touched anything rusty. Except, I did clean the shower today, and maybe the combination of ammonia and old residue causes such a smell, even when you're using gloves. Other than that, I don't really smell anything. God, my stomach is rumbling like crazy now. I really want to eat. I'm so mad at myself, if I had just gone to that Freshman Business meeting, I would be eating free pizza now. But no, I have to be a ""conformist"" and go when all my other friends are going. Now I have to pay for my food. And even now, I'll probably end up waiting until the other three girls in the room are done studying. Why am I such a follower?  I hope I gain some leadership qualities through my college experience. I wonder why the microfridge makes that noise, that constant hum. Did you know, something's wrong with the microfridge in my room. We had it set at level 5, and we open the door, and find that our water bottles have ice in them rather than water, and there are pearly crystals in our milk. Man, that was weird. I lowered the temperature a little, hopefully that helps. The strange thing is, our suitemates had their microfridge set at a little past level 5, and their food is fine. Aren't all the microfridges supposed to be the same?  Fridge discrimination. Anyway. what else is there to say?  My eyes feel sleepy. Not in the heavy sense though, where you feel as though you couldn't keep your lids up if your life depended on it. No, not that kind of sleepy. It's the kind where your eyes slightly burn when you close them, and you have mild sinus symptoms. Or perhaps this feeling is due more to an oncoming sinus attack rather than my sleepiness. Either way, I should be sleepy, I did a lot of work today. I'm so proud of my productivity today. After calculus, I went straight to the library, printed out my UBC application, then went straight to one of the desks and did my Psychology homework. That's right, two and a half hours of reading and taking notes. I even drew a rudimentary picture of a neuron. Whoa. Sometimes I think I work too hard. I mean, did I really have to write down all the processes of the neurons?  Ultimately, I probably won't need half the stuff I've taken note of. Luckily, I actually kind of enjoy psychology, so I don't mind taking the notes. Man, I need to spit out this gum. It's like I'm chewing rubber or something. And my jaw hurts from all the exercise it's gotten. I think I've had this gum in my mouth for about two hours, if not more. Man, I have to laugh at the way these girls are studying. They're thinking of ways to remember all the terminology. Here's the funniest one: ""penia"" means abnormal reduction. So, what does my gutter-mind think of?  Hahaha. I can't help it, I'm still immature. Hopefully my professors don't get wind of it. But you must admit, that's a good way to remember ""penia"", isn't it?  I'm not even in medical terminology, and I will always remember that term. Oh God, my eyes are starting to feel a little heavy now, in addition to the burning. Why do I get so tired here?  True, I can probably sleep at any time, but I've noticed my desire to get to my bed as increased dramatically ever since I started school at UT. Maybe it's the so-called stress we just discussed in class today. I was feeling pretty fit last week, maybe now I will get sick during Labor Day weekend. Let's see. six more minutes. Sorry, but I am counting down. Who knew twenty minutes was so interminably long?  I like using big words, it makes me feel so intelligent. I know that's immature to think, but I really am just a child inside, filled with all the normal childish feelings of wonder and happiness and petty jealousy. Yes, petty jealousy. Like my jealousy toward all the pretty girls on campus, many of whom are my friends, which makes me feel all the worse, because aren't you supposed to not have bad feelings about your friends?  But I suppose that wouldn't be human. But guilt is a totally human feeling as well, so I will continue feeling that. Sometimes I wish I was my puppy, Ginger, with my biggest worry being that I'll see my own reflection on a window. Did you know that dogs sleep about 18 hours every day?  I would kill for such a luxury. Even when I'm retired, I doubt I'll receive such a luxury. I can feel the keys of the laptop getting warm. Or perhaps they were already warm. who knows. I definitely don't. Sorry, but seeing as how I only have about two minutes left, what will follow will probably be nonsensical gibberish that I'm typing for the sole purpose of taking up time. I need to go to sleep. But no, it's only six in the evening. Six!  It's like time moves at a slow-warped speed here. Isn't it supposed to be bedtime?  I want to sleep. I want to sleep. I want to sleep. and dream. I wish I could remember my dreams better, or that someone could analyze my dreams. Or maybe I don't want that. Who knows what would turn up. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     I am sitting in my room. There is tile being laid in the bathroom next to me. The sound of musics floats in from the next room. Paint smells intoxicate me. I feel slightly light headed as I have for the past several days in my apartment. The sound of the modem next to the computer begins to hum as if it is heating up. My mama walks in the room and looks annoyed as the desk she trying to put together is not working according to her plan. I wonder whey she looks so upset about it. The air conditioner begins to run. I have a book for my government class lying open on the floor. Who would have known that there would be that much reading for one class. I cannot tell if I want to finish reading it or try and take notes from class for it to make sense. The phone rings next to me. I don't pick it up because I am worried I have waited too long to finish this assignment and I won't get full credit. I fell asleep reading earlier this afternoon and just woke up. Funny how the time just slips away like that. You are payiong attention to everything around you one minute and the next it is gone. You wake up and can't remember when you fell asleep the time before right now. My nose starts to itch which is funny,because it isn't even dusty in my apartment right now. The green wall of my bedroom is making the setting sunlight a strange color on my feet. They look a weird yellow color as if they are becoming infected with something. It makes my sheets look pretty though. The mixture of green, yellow, and purple reminds me of a rainbow. Everything is starting to fade. My mind and eyes start to slow down. Everyone around me is moving too fast for my taste. I want it to slow down. Everything should be slower these days. I like it when it is lazy like on Sundays. I watch TV until I feel like eating something. I can smell my mama start to cook dinner. She always makes such good food for me. I smell cheese melting on something. I think it might be broccoli. But you can't smell brocolli. I keep spelling that differently. I wonder how it is supposed to be spelled. How funny. Things like that when they happen. LIke when you can't remember how to spell and or something easy like that. I realized I haven't typed for the whole 20 minutes right now, but I have to have it in by five. I think I will try to do it again in a minute. I hope this isn't too bad. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     I guess  I will talk about the guy I was dating before I came here, since I just got off the phone with him before I got on the computer to complete this assignment. After dating him for two months I realized relationships differ greatly from person to person. There are no straight rules to follow. Everyone makes up there own rules when they date someone by what is right for them. At first I was so confused by this guy  because he did not call me on a regular bases or he didn't schedule dates like other guys did. After just talking to him now has made me realized he didn't do this to be a jerk but it is who he is, because he only called me when he had something to say to me. Right now he is dating another girl but he doesn't call her and she doesn't call him. I think that is weird. I guess I will have to learn that relationships will give me experience to meet all sorts of people and how to deal with them. I still talk to this guy everyday and we are friends but I am getting to know him better than when we dated because now we are forced to rely solely on talking and no physical contact. I had lunch with this guy earlier who trying to make the long distace relationship thing work. I was thinking I could never do that. I think it would be hard to trust someone that much or not have physical contact. Because I believe that seeing someone and spending time with them is a big part of a relationship, so that is why the guy and I are not together. I thinkI'm still new to the dating thing because I don't understand it. I try not to play games, but sometimes its hard not to if the other person is. I have mostly dated older people. My first real boyfriend was seven years older than I. That relationship was not a good idea he was at a different point in his life than I was. His majurity level was that of an eighteen year old boy, that was why it lasted as long as it did. I think sometimes people stick together because they fear that there won't be somebody else in the future to fill that person's spot. After breaking up with him I felt I needed a boyfriend and I even felt a little lonely. Now I am fine and mostly dated for fun I guess you could say but my parents thought it was stupid. I gained a lot of experience this summer and have learned what characteristics of others I find attractive or of high standing and what I don't want my future husband to have one day. Not to say I am definitly marrying someone but I hope I will find that right someone. For right now though I am going to stick to being a loner because being so close to someone can be distracting and my purpose here is to stay focused on school becuase before I ever get married I want to have finished school for my own personal goal. You can't always rely on others in life so if I get a good education I can get a good job to support myself. This has made me realize that when you do something do it for yourself and not for anyone else and don't stop what you are doing just for someone else. Because that someone else might not always be there. This has led me to conclude that you shouldn't care what others think because if it makes you happy than go for it as long as it doesn't harm anyone else. I hope I fulfilled the assignment by writing aobut what I was thinking about. I feel confused by relationships and I guess I should be and I am assuming that everyone else is confused by them as well. I just hope everything will work in the long run and so I'll try not to worry about because I used to worry about things to much that I would stress my self out. "
Tell me about yourself.,"well I guess it'll be good to get this out of the way. Let's see what's on my mind. ok I think I need to turn off the TV and maybe turn on a little music. this seems like it could get boring. hmm. maybe that's a bad sign that I think my thoughts are goig to be boring. anyway, all right, the tv's off and now the musics on. much better. well I'm officially pledging phi delt tonight. I'm going to be assigned my big brother at the meeting this evening and I'm pretty excited. I think this is going to be a lot of fun. john's pledging with me and I guess we're going to get to be pretty good friends. this is kind of nice. this is a good way to clear my thoughts up. I've heard before that writing out everything makes you slow your thoughts to the pace of writing and it's an effective way to clear your head. what kind of phrase is that. clear your head? that's a weird thing when you actually think about it. ok I can't talk about one thing for very long. wow this time is going pretty fast. it doesn't seem like I've been writing long at all and I'm a quarter of the way done. ok well let's accomplish something productive here. what do I need to do today? I need to get khakis and a white shirt for tonight. hmm I wonder what I should do about shoes. I didn't bring my dress shoes I don't think. that's one bad thing about being 8 hours from home. when I remember something that I forgot to bring, or didn't think I would need, there's not much I can do about it. ok what else do I need to do today. its labor day. I like not having class. umm ok think, I need to study chapter 5 in biology. really I need to review all of the chapters that's got to be my biggest priority today. and I need to finish reading my psych chapters and philosophy stuff. I feel like I always  have something to do. it was this way in high school too though so I guess its not that bad. there's a guy pledging with me that reminds of somebody famous but I can't place it. I don't think I've ever heard this song but I know the band. that's not saying much for the band. or maybe it is. either they have a unique sound or all of their songs sound too much alike. I don't know which it is in this case. maybe a little of both. ok the time is not going as quickly as I thought it was. do I have anything else to do today? clothes, read, umm I've talked to my mom today about everything I think I needed to tell her. I paid my stupid parking ticket. there's 40 bucks wasted on me stupidity. I thought about appealing it but they called out my exact reason for the appeal on ""reasons not to appeal your ticket"" apparently just being a dumbass isn't a valid reason. I love this song. barenaked ladies are a good band. I want to see them in concert again. oh concert. I can't wait for the acl festival coming up. and next weekend I'm going to mexico with the phi delts. oh this is going to be a lot of fun. I'm excited for so many things this semester. I just need to make sure I keep my grades up and everything. I'm sure I will. I don't forsee myself slacking off at all. if I want to get into medical school I need to have the best grades possible. but then I don't know if I really want to go to medical school. I need to talk to an advisor about this stuff. hopefully I can get into my fig advisor tomorrow and see what he has to say. I can't decide if I want to major in neurobiology or switch to liberal arts and look into psychology. I think this is a really interesting field but at the same time I feel like its uhhh I lost my train of thought. lets see. I feel like its umm something that too many people do. its over done as a major I guess I don't really know what word to use to describe it. woo! one minute remaining. umm so yeah psychology is really interesting. I'm actually not dreading reading the rest of the chapters. in fact I'm kind of looking forward to it. ok well the times up I guess I'll quit now. that was fun. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     Right now I am realli thinkingabout buying a soccerball so that I can starttraining because I really want to join a soccer team. I did not go to the gyn todayso I thing I'l go tomorrow. My CD of the soundtrack of Queen of the Damn is one of the best CD's I have ever heard. I need to get a laptop ecause everyday I have more and more homework like whatI am doing right now and my chemistry homework which I also have to do online. I do not knw why I feel so tired. I think its because I am having too much homework. I really do not like the hot weather. I prefer winter over any other season in the year only because I like the gloomy and quiet weather. I am already getting tired of writing and I think I am going to go to sleep early today so that tomrrow I can go to the Gym and still not be so tired as today so that I can do more homework. I really miss all my family. I am so used to a lot of noise and laughter since I have two brothers and two sisters. I miss playing with my baby sister who is only three years old. I want to finish this so that I can start playing my favorite game, ""The king of fighters. "" Oh I almost forgot I need to call my family because I told my dad I was going to call them yesterday but I didn't. I am hungry. I need to go to sleep. I realy do believe there exists other civilizations in our galaxy. I don't gethow so many people can go to church every sunday and even n otherdays of the week. I'm tired of sittinglike this. I need to get a chair or my back is going to start hurting. The lyrics from the CD ""Jaguares"" are so amazing. It really helps me to listen to these lyrics because they talk about different aspects of life and the mind. If I was to chance my major I would change it to Aerospace Enineering because  love everything that has to do with airplanes. I think I am. "
Tell me about yourself.,"I'm thinking about if I am going to get the job that I want at the PAC at the university it would suck if I didn't I am proud that the OTC called me for a job interview, they said my resume especially my volunteer work was impressive it makes me feel like I didn't waste my time during high school and this clock it makes me nervous so I can't type as fast and I keep having to go back and erase but I like pressure I thrive under it but I don't like time pressure and as for the apostrophes in words I do not like those because I am so used to using slang that I just do not type it anymore and I also hate having to capitalize my I's it makes me mad having to go back. Right now I feel a little stress because I am espcially behind on reading not on purpose but yesterday I had a meeting and I did not know it was going to last 2 hours and a half it threw me off schedule so all I could read was Biology which is another class I don't understand I never like science and getting up in the mornings at 8 does not help either I feel lost in that class it is so difficult I feel like I dumber than everyone else and this feels like a cry for help but it is not I just keep thinking about what Prof. Pennebaker said anyways that class sometimes makes me feel. Like screaming I guess but the Professor is nice he just goes so fast and everyone seems or pretends like they understand and typing on lap tops gets on my nerves because at home I had a divided keyboard the ""flowy"" ones and now I have this laptop and everything is squeezed together it makes me really nervous as for this assignment I like but I feel like I shouldn't say anything incriminating and there go the stupid I's and I forgort to put and apostrophe in shouldn't and the I messed me up again. Well forget it no more caps; the I's are going to be in lower case. Sometimes typing in slang gets to be a bad habit I need to get into the habit of typing properly again oh and this weekend I get to go home though I want to go to the game I have not boguht the sports package and I didn't feel like getting up really early to buy tickets some guy in my floor is selling the tickets for 50 dollars is that a lot I guess so maybe oh and my friend jeremy's a football player so I feel like I should go for him but I'm not going. Now I get to go home sit and do homework college is very stressfull maybe I'll get sick when I go home like Prof. Pennebaker said probably because I feel the migrane coming. I hate migranes I hate having to find a job hopefully I get a good one I have an interview on Tuesday I hope it goes well and that I make it on time because if not it is going to reflect poorly on my but the lady undestood. I wonder how the bus works I keep thinking of the bus stop and how the place is going to look like and of the bus bcause I have seen it once after running to the engineering building because I was late I saw the bus and I think you can only take it there which is kind of sucky but I will take a look around and see if that's how it works. Now I feel like I have run out of things to say I still have to do the experiment for this class I want to do the survey but since I am under 18 I have to get my moms signature and I feel like I should be happy about going home I mean excited to see my mom and my brother but it is like ""huh"" and I hope nothings happens like the bus doesn't break down or like it is ""kidnapped' I know I worry too much but I don't want anything to happen even if it means that I have to do all the homework, I've been trying to check my spelling so this makes it easier on you guys, and what was I talking about I don't kno, I need to make friends me and my roommate get along but I need other friends and now I have 5 minutes left, what to write about anyways back to the making friends I saw wayne who went to my high school and seemed like a pretty smart Asian in the elevator today I feel bad for saying that but most asians are anyways the making friends the friends that I have are okay but I don't really relate to them why I don't kno I feel like they exclude me too much and they don't at least I hope they don't and if they do I don't well hope that they are doing it on purpose but still I have roughly 4 minutes left more like 3 because it is about to be 17 minutes the numbers on these computers are weird anyways well they are not really I am surprised I wrote this much I thought I was going to run out of this to say but I like this assignment when Prof. Pennebaker said it I was like yes no grammar rules I don't particularly like grammar but I try I mean I suck at it in my papers I always score low on it 2 minutes and I have mentioned my time too many times I tried not to look at the clock at the beginning and I did nto so now I keep talking about NOT because I want the assignment to be ove but because some one just slammed their door my head hurts I think it is the flourescent lighting I think that is how u spell that and I just put the letter u for the word you and I am kind of hungry and the clock is winding down and I keep typing faster kind of scared oh well you can keep typing oh my gosh I thought it was over but I am going to stop now because a I don't want to talk for too long and I have to go turn of this light and I am thinking about what I just wrote and what u guys are thinking or will think when u read it and all the noise in the background and if I should put my name at the bottom but I won't because I have the code thing. well this was productive and I did not put well in caps. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     When I think about what I'm thinking, a void pops up. I guess because the brain never really stops, it's hard to pinpoint an exact thought in any moment. I can recall past topics that have rambled through my mind however, so that's what I'll dicuss. A topic that's popluar in my brain is my boyfriend (surprising right?)  I think about how happy I am in our relationship and how much of a good friend and boyfriend he is. He goes to college at Trinity University, which is in my hometown of San Antonio. We see eachother nearly every weekend, so it's not hard to sustain the relationship. Though, I constantly wonder if he really does care about me. He tells me that he does, and I know that he does, but I'm really insecure about that issue. My insecurity on that issue stems from my past relationship where my then boyfriend would tell me that he cared about me, but ended the relationship somewhat abruptly without any sign or signal. That's probably why I worry so much about it. However, I am really happy in my relationship. I have no complaints except for my own lack of security. On another topic, I have my first test this Thursday. I'm a little scared, but I think that I'll be fine. I pretty much know the material, but I still need to go over and over it to get it down. I don't think I'll have a problem with it. At least I hope that I do well. I feel exahsted thinking about all the studying I have to do for my upcoming tests. I have a chemistry test next week. I don't know how to do converstions without a table telling me what every measurement is. But I guess that I'm going to need to memorize that sort of stuff so I do well. It's so imperitive that I do well in college because I have plans to go to medical school after I graduate. I don't know what else I would do with my life if I didn't get into medical school. I have developed some back up plans if you will in case something should happen. I could be a teacher if medical school doesn't work out. The pay isn't that great but the job seems pretty alright. I would enjoy some sort of FBI/CIA type of work also. I need something that's going to make me constantly think. Though I hate studying, as every student does, keeping my mind on the go is something I love. I think that's why I played soccer all my life. Soccer is a game of constant thinking. There is no stopping in soccer. There are no time outs, so you can't stop to regroup. You have to be on your toes and know your stuff to be a good soccer player. I wish I was still playing soccer. I really miss it. I stopped playing after my last high school season a few months back. I feel sort of empty without it. It was such a big part of my life for so long. I think I'm going to attempt to walk on next year to the UT soccer team. It's really hard to do that though. The team is extremely competative. Though, I think after I talk to my coaches back home, maybe they can help. My main concern at the moment is doing well in school. I really need to buckle down and study. I study everyday, but I need to do it more I think. Maybe I'm just stressing about my upcoming tests. I'm scared about my chemistry test. Though, I think with the right amount memorization of some problems along with some other material, that I'll be fine. I need to start preparing for my biology test tomorrow. The test is Thursday, so I have 2 days to get in all the information. I feel tired right now. I wish I had came back to Austin earlier so I would've started on my work earlier. Well, tomorrow's another day, so I guess I'll just do a lot of studying tomorrow. There's no sense in doing it right this second when I'm not feeling to good and when I'm tired. My main priority is studying for my biology test Thursday. I need to go over the old exam she gave to us. My boyfriend just called me, but I had to tell him that I would call him back so I could finish this writing assignment. I really hope I do well on my test Thursday. If I did well, I would be so happy. That would mean that I actually liked my major and that I could retain the information pertaining to it. I want to call my boyfriend back after this, but my roommate ""can't consontrait"" with my talking, so I guess I'll go outside. Though, she's talked many a times with her boyfriend while I was reading. Oh well, maybe I'm a little more respectful. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Ok well I'm thinking about how long of a day it was, I got to school kind of late and I was almost late to my first class. I'm not really smelling anything right now because my nose is a little stuffy and runny I think it is due to my girlfriend who has been getting sick lately, we went to buy tylenol cold at the target on 35. I just spoke to here and she said that she was going to take a little nap and I told her not to because she was complaining all day that she had so much to do and there wasn't any time to do it. Well she didn't listen to me she said for me to call her at 7:15 if she hasnt called me. she went with me to psy class today even though she already took it last semester. she was very moved by the way the professor was. I think she said I wish I had him for my psy class. I told before that he was very cool like our communications teacher dr. daly who is a very cool teacher as well, his class is awesome he's so charismatic, today we had a supplemental discussion for that class and I have my girlfriends friend from back home in that class who just broke up with her boyfriend whom she had been going out with for about two years or so, and we were just talking and she was telling me how she hated our comm. class because all they talk about in that class is relationships and she feels sad every time he uses one of the students as examples, now on the topic of my girlfriends friends. By the way her name is desiree and she is beautiful and I love her a lot, I don't know when and where but someday we plan on getting married, I think we are different than most couples, I know that everybody probably says that but I really do think that we are because yes we spend a lot of time together and I hear that that is a bad thing but were different because we involve God in our relationship, not as much as we should but more than most couples I think, in the summer we read the bible every night for the last couple of weeks. But since we got up here, we haven't read it at all, I think its because were so happy with each other and we love to spend time with one another that its hard to do something else besides kissing and having sex at night. now back to her other friend named nancy. Well she is rooming with desiree's old roommate kelly, and well a few days ago kelly had a talk with nancy, she was really mad from what I hear because she took the time to underline in the contract that no one else has permission to stay for more than three consecutive nights in their apt. without some kind of notice, and well nancy has a boyfriend who is always over there and kelly gets really mad. Me and desiree were thinking that she is just jealous because her boyfriend isn't over there as much as he should be. like my roommate said that he wasn't going to talk to his ex when he came up here because she broke up with him last year when she was still in high school and he was up here. well now that she is up here too, he said that he was not going to talk to her at all, well shit that didn't last very long, just the other night he stayed at her dorm because they had to homework for the same class that they both share. Hmm. What a coincidence, I mean me and my girlfriend had a class last together too and I think that that helped out a lot because no matter if we didn't see each other every day we definetly saw each other on those days that we had class, I mean we really werent together yet but that certainly helped out our relationship a lot. my friend oj keeps calling me because he wants to go eat at the olive garden and I told him that I don't know because I running tight on money and I kind of got in trouble the other day with my mom because I went on a little shopping spree and spent a good amount of money at diesel. the part that she got mad at was the jeans that I bought for 100 dollars and that's because they were on sale. she said imagine how many shirts u could have bought with that. so I don't know if ill go but I do want to play him in NCAA 2005 college football that's like our fav game and my roommate just bought a big screen with a surround sound so its awesome to play on that I haven't even tried it I think I'm going right now to go play laterz!          "
Tell me about yourself.,"     So I think this is a very cool assignment for the students to complete. It gives a very good look at what we are thinking in our heads. I probably don't realize some of the things that I think. maybe after looking at this I will be suprised or shocked or some other feeling. I smell food. I just ate but food smells so good that it makes me want more. I have this weezer song in my head. I don't like weezer yet this song gets stuck in my head. I hope it gets out fast because it is annoying. my neck feels like it is rubber and just wants to fall down, taking my head with it. that would hurt. never have I done so much reading as I have done this past week. it is annoying. I do not enjoy reading much. oh well. I guess I have to do it anyway. my window doesn't get enough light through because it faces our balcony which blocks off some of the light. the apartment is nice. I get my own room and it is very spacious. I hear a ticking sound and it is not a clock. its bugging me and I think its a result of me typing. yep. I stopped and the ticking stopped. I think it is a clock but the clock is rubbing against the wall and isn't on. how ironic maybe. interesting. it stopped. they weezer song was out of my head but it came back for an encore. ill be right back sorry. blanked out for a second. the days seem to go by very fast. the weekends go slow however. I like the weekends. this weekend should be great because I will go hoome for the labor day holiday. seeing my friends from back home alwasy makes me happy. greek mythology has too many  names to remember even a quarter of them. its very a nnoying. how many times have  I said annoying in my train of thought. a good nap would be nice right now. I like that painting of the melting clocks. its very surreal and somehow that makes me feel good. I wanted a poster of it but they were like ten dollars. its just not worth it to me. I am a very economical person when handling money. sometimes its good and bad. a ten dollar poster wasn't a wise choice for me though. cooking. I need to start cooking more things. sure the microwave is awesome but I need to expand my cuisine. iron chef. funny show. iron chef should fight emeril. I wonder who would win. they should put those old batman captions like bam, and wham, and pow on Emerils show when he says those things. it will give it an old school flavor. flavor is good. does water have a flavor. is the flavor water. who cares its good when you're thirsty. I just wish it had like b vitamins like powerade. because water doesn't have like those sugars and stuff. or are the b vitamins coming from the sugars. ill look into it. my mouth is dry. I oculd actually go for some water right now. my neck keeps getting my head closer and closer to the table. I wish I could fly. I just saw some birds flying. I wish I could do that. where would I go. I'd probably go to some tropical climate if my body allowed me too. that would be awesome. today is the first day of the rest of my life. that quote always struck me as very cool sounding. is hould really start using my planner to right down what I need to get done. my memory doesn't serve me quite well. I want some of the energy arizona iced tea. I haven't had any for  quite some time. I'm due for some. but I guess right now all I got is water. that will have to do. potpourri is such a weird word. but smells nice so I guess they are even. I bet it is fun to read other peoples streams of thought. it must be amusing to see all the weird things people come up with without maybe realizing it much. this is one of the best writing assignments I've ever had to write because there is no structure. I am a poor writer. I should practice and get help. I probabloy won't though. ill just get by onw what I can do. it just isn't my thing. donde esta el biblioteca. I need to work on myh Spanish to. hopefully I won't have to take a Spanish class. that would piss me off. I can't stand learning that language or any language for that matter. it would take me too much time. I think tex mex will serve me just fine. bien bien bien. if my phone rings right now its going to scare the hell otta me because I'm so itno righting this. I hope that doesn't happen "
Tell me about yourself.,"     Hello. Good morning! I actually woke up early this morning, which really surprised me because we had a crazy night last night. Okay, I am listening to the most awesome song right now. I'm wondering if I should listen to it again. Like start it over when it's over. Or, on second thought, should I just start it over right now? Ah, who cares? Anyway I'm wondering when I should go to the cafeteria to get brunch. I had the most strange experience this morning when I got up. I walked to the kitchen to get a water from the frige and there was my suite  mate with a guy asleep on the bed in the living room. Yes, we actually have a bed in the living room. I had a really sucky room mate and we weren't exactly getting along so she moved out and we used her bed as another couch. I am going to be so tired when these 20 minutes are over. Haha, my fingers are already getting tired of typing. Hold on, I'm going to start over my song. Okay, sorry. I honestly don't know exactly what it is that I am supposed to be doing in this assignment. I don't believe I ever have actually had an assignment to just type on what goes through my head. I always have a lot of crap going through my head. I am ADD positive. pretty bad actually. And it affects what I think about every day. I wonder if it will every go away. Is that even possible? I wonder if my professor even knows who I am. Doubt it. Man that sucks. I always stress about whether my teachers know who I am because I think that is awesome if you are on a first name basis. Hmm. What should I do to make him know me? Perhaps I should make a big scene in class. But I don't want all of my class mates to think I'm like a major loser. Okay now I am beginning to wonder if I should just like leave this thing going while I go get something to eat. I don't know if that would be allowed, but it is quite tempting. Man, you know what sucks? On Friday, I woke up like really freakin' sick and I missed my math class along with my chemistry class, and I missed my quiz in chemistry. Ugh! I wonder what my teacher is going to have to say about that because she like requires doctor's notes and crap for her class. Can we say IMMATURE? Oooooo, I love this song too! Twista: Celebrity Overnight. Aw! It reminds me of my ex-boyfriend. That sucks because he hasn't been too nice to me here lately. Man I could talk all day about him. Doubt the reader of this crappy paper would really enjoy that, but that is now what I am thinking about so I guess get ready. He is so cute. He is so sweet. Besides lately. He always could cheer me up, but we broke up right before I left because he is just now a senior in high school and he didn't want to date when I was living 4 hours away. I must say that is a long distance away from the person that you are dating, but I really do believe I love him. He is so the person for me, and I don't know exactly how to take that. I don't know if I should try to get over him or if I should just keep talking to him and trying to get him to come visit me. Or if I should even tell him that I love him. I am so confused! Urgh! I wish this program could talk back because I would be so happy to receive advice. I thought it was so funny when my psychology teacher. Hold on I totally forgot what I was thinking about. Anyway someone puked in my living room the other night. Yea, it really pissed me off. I wonder why they didn't just go to the freakin' bathroom! It's like. Hey I'm drunk. Oh yea I'm just going to sit here and puke all over my friend's floor and make them clean it up. Damnit, grow up! I want to take a nap so bad. I don't know what is more important, napping or eating. Perhaps I'll get something to eat and then go take a nap. It feels good to get an assignment done. I have to work on chemistry later and I'm honestly thinking I'm going to get some beer to drink before I start on it. Man, why do college people drink so much? I've never gone like a whole week drinking every single night. I feel like I'm going to like die of some liver disease. Haha, that would suck. Okay, I don't like thinking about that. I hope I make a good grade in this class. I'm kind of trying to rely on this class to help my GPA. If I can pull off a 3. 0 then I would totally kick ass. My parents are thinking I'm going to do badly. Hah, I'll show them. Drinking every night and going to class and making good grades. Damn I'm going to blow them away. Oh yea did I mention we don't have a freakin' TV in our room anymore? Yea, it sucks gathering around a freakin' laptop to watch a movie. Yes! I only have like 3 more minutes to type. Okay, now less! I wonder how long my suite mate is going to sleep today. My other suite mate apparently didn't even make it home last night. I went to bed with straight hair and woke up with really curly hair. Hmm. Wonder what happened there. I remember waltsing last night. The Australians taught me how to walts and how to do the salsa. It was awesome. until I burned my finger. I suppose that's another story. Okay, I hear someone talking. Yes! My time is almost up. I guess it just like cuts my sentence off when time is up. That sucks. I hate leaving things unfinished. I'm going to stop now because I hate I when I get cut off and I only have a few seconds. Looking foreward to class!!. . . Not really. Sorry. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     I am finally taking a break from doing my math homework. I am so excited to finally be doing nothing. I am so excited that I finally got my laundry back because now I do not have to worry about it, but I do need to do a load of some personal items. While looking around my room I see my side pretty neat and then I look at my roommate's side and it is a pig-sty. It bothers me because she has buckets overflowing everywhere, when they could easily at least be hidden under her bed. Maybe we will have a talk about that later?  Who knows. But I cannot wait for this weekend because not only is it a three day weekend, but that's one more day that I don't have to go to class. I love living here at Towers but the walls are paper thin. I can hear anything and everything that my roommate/suitmate say and sometimes that's okay but when I'm trying to concentrate on something it kind of bothers me. Oh well, life could be worse. I wonder what else I have to do to prepare myself for tomorrow?  I think I need to go to Allie's room at some point to get her notes from Philosophy that I missed last week, and I really need to go return a book to the Co-Op and go by the bank because the stupid people sent me my check card with my dad's name on it. Why would they do such a thing?  Oh well at least it won't be too hard to fix. At least I hope it won't be too hard to fix. I am so tired but I got so much sleep last night and I don't understand how I'm so tired after only going to class for an hour and a half today? It makes no sense to me. Maybe I am still transforming into the ""college-life-style"" and I'm just not used to it yet?  I'm getting very sleepy but there's no point in trying to take a nap because I know it won't happen for me. I love how I have so many pictures around my room because everywhere I look I am reminded of a fun time with my friends from home. Speaking of home, I feel like so many people are going home this weekend. As much as I would like to go home, I don't think I'm quite ready to leave here yet. I don't think I'm settled in enough yet to get up and leave already. Even if I did go home my parents wouldn't be there because they are going to the lake. I wonder if I will see them at all since they'll be so close to me now?  Maybe I will call them later and ask. Oh and I need to call Mimi back since she left me a message yesterday. I'll call her later when I have a few minutes to spare since I know the conversation will last for a lifetime. Or I guess I should say it will last for a long time. It's amazing how I was here in my room for so long by myself without my roommate or suitmate, and then all of a sudden it's like they both appeared at the same time, and within five minutes they both left and I'm left alone again in quietness. I will most definitely take advantage of that alone/quiet time, but then again sometimes I do get bored sitting here by myself. They asked me if I wanted to go eat with them but I just ate a few hours ago, I might as well save my meals for when I'm actually hungry right?  Wow, looking up at the clock I never realized how long twenty minutes really is. I feel almost out of breath because I've been typing so much so fast and its only been a mere ten minutes. My  sister just called but I have to call her back. She didn't seem to mind because she said that her and her friend Jessi would be searching for Jessi's car anyway. So I wonder what happened to it?  Did she park somewhere and forget where she left it?  Weird. I hope I never do that. Although it would probably be hard for me to do that since I've only driven my car twice in two weeks. I wonder if that's bad for it?  Maybe I need to try to drive it at least once a week to make sure it still works?  I should probably ask my dad about that. So its only four oclock in the afternoon and I feel like its ten at night. Why is that?  Well I just hope I keep up with everything as much as I'm ""supposed"" to because college is definitely not like high school. High school is like a joke compared to what I've experienced in only 5 days. Oh well at least we get a month of for winter break instead of two weeks. So about winter break. I cannot wait to go home because I think we will have like a reunion of everyone getting to be together once again. I'm sure Ill see most of my friends over Thanksgiving break but the first time we will all be together with the ""old gang"" will probably be Christmas break. That will be a fun break, and I know it will be great seeing everyone again. I wonder if my family will be taking any kind of of trip?  Hmmm there's another thing I need to check into because I don't like finding out about things like that at the last minute. Especially since my best friend who lives in Virginia will be in Houston for part of the break. If I missed her because I was on a family trip I would be extremely upset so I need to figure it out to make sure I will be around. Wow my eyes are shutting so much maybe I should go get some coffee from downstairs? Sounds like a great idea and it will probably make my throat feel a little better since it's kind of of sore. I think just getting used to college life and my new schedule is wearing me out enough to feel a little under the weather. I can't wait to fully recooperate so I can feel 100% again. Then hopefully I will be in a better mood and not so irritable?  Hopefully!  Well now getting back to the matter at hand, this assignment. ALthough it has been time consuming, it's probably been the easiest assignment of my entire life. Wow and that's saying a lot!!!  I am so interested to see what our next assignment is like, since our professor said that there will never be another one like this again. Our class is huge and I actually saw a second person that I know yesterday when I was walking out. Speaking of I should probably call that friend of mine. Well it looks to me that I just glanced up and this assignment is over! Yay :-) "
Tell me about yourself.,"Let's see. I'm sitting here in my dorm room all alone. This is a great time to get some homework done before my roommate comes back. Not that she's not a cool person or anything, I just can concentrate better when I'm alone and when it is quiet. But that is almost impossibe here in Jester. There are always people roaming the halls making loud noises. Like right now!  Oh well, it is something I must get used to. Or I can do what I did last night. Wait until around midnight to go to the study lounge located on this floor to get my reading done. I stayed there until 1:30 a. M. I guess I can do my work better at night. My fingers are freezing!  This room is so cold!  I haven't even figured out how to change the temperature in this room, it is insane. I'm cold even when I go to bed at night with my blanket. I have to constantly keep a sweater on and I cannot wear shorts like I used to back at home. Aw, home!  I think I am starting to miss being at home. I called the house the other day and my 11-year old brother told me he misses me. This, ladies and gentlemen, is something that never occurs. I do go back home on Thursday night, but only so that I can get to the DFW airport Friday morning for my flight to Atlanta. I am competing in a sports tournament for my church. I am playing flag football and running track. Another cool thing about this weekend get away is that I get to see the guy I've been dating for less than a month. Well, I've known him for about 4 years, but we just started hanging out a lot after we did a children's camp for my church together. It's funny because he liked me after we were participants in a camp when we were about 13. I went to a dance with him after that, but only because I didn't want to be mean. He is exactly a year and 13 days younger than me. That was always an issue for me before, but for some reason, I really don't care anymore. He is the sweetest and funniest guy I have ever met. I actually just got out of a 3 year and 3 month relationship a month ago. Me and my ex-boyfriend decided that since we were both going off to college, we should take time apart and maybe date other people since he was my first and only boyfriend. A week after we broke things off, this new guy I'm dating told me he had feelings for me. I was so confused and didn't know what to do because I had just got out of a relationship and I was going to be moving to Austin in a few weeks. But I'm normally the uptight girl that can't let loose and enjoy myself. Because of that, I decided that I'd go ahead and be true to my feelings and attempt to actully be with another guy. We decided we'd just go with the flow and not really label ourselves. My ex found out and was extremely jealous. It just bites that he showed his love and affection for me after he hears about me being with another guy. But oh well, that's life I guess. I am really glad I continued to see this other guy, regardless of what my ex had to say. I spent every day with him until the day I left. I have never met anyone that has made me laugh so much. He is amazing. The only thing I'm worried about is that I'll fall too hard and too quickly for him. I mean I did just get out of a serious relationship and I don't think I'm quite ready for another one. That's the only problem I'm having right now. The fact that he's a high school student does not bug me as it used to. But the distance might become an issue. It was an issue in a way for me and my ex, so I do feel a tad bit guilty that I'm willing to work things out with this new guy rather than my ex. But my ex did not treat me as well as this new one is treating me. But yeah, that is basically what has been on my mind like everyday while at UT. But I am definitely loving it here in Austin. I enjoy all of my professors and classes. Having two biology classes and a chemistry class, however, can be tough. In addition I am taking this psychology class, which I dropped economics for because it seems way more fun and interesting. Other than that I have my freshman seminar class, which has the topic of promoting health in multicultural populations. I just finished the reading for that class right before I started this assignment. Ah, my hands are still so cold. What do I do?!  My ears are feeling very cold too. Must I wear gloves in the summer in my DORM ROOM?!  Or my bad, it is the fall now. Same thing. Today is the day for my mile run. Ever since I moved to Austin, I have been running a mile every other day at the Gregory Gym. I absolutely love that place!  And it is so convenient because it is right next to Jester. Freshman 15 can kiss my booty because I am staying in shape!  I find that I've been working out more here than I was doing at home in the summer. I really love this lifestyle I have at UT. The whole freedom thing is still a bit overwhelming, but I do not feel like I am abusing it. I did party a lot this weekend, but I didn't drink or anything. People keep calling me a party girl and it is actually making me a bit upset. I don't want people to view me as a party girl because I'm not out of control or anything. Oh well. I see that this writing is almost up. That wasn't too bad! "
Tell me about yourself.," Wow this is actually a cool writing assignment. I would have never expected to be asked to sit here at my computer and just write what I am thinking for a 20 minute period. I have just gotten back from a meeting about the Texas Lonestars organization and LOVED it!  The only problem is that I am just a freshman still getting use to the whole college life and time management thing. I am kind of stressed out (but not nearly as bad as I know I can get sometimes) just because I am pre med and I know that I really need to concentrate on my grades and school work while also getting involved. Getting involved, however has never been a problem for me. I love to be involved in everything. Now that is a problem because if I spread myself too thin I am not going to be able to put forth my best in each venue. I know for sure that I want to do something involving dance because it has been such an intricate part of my life for so long and is truly one of my passions. I am going to try out for the Roustabouts and the Steel Dance Company. I am beginning to get nervous just because I haven't really gotten the chance to practice anywhere here since I've been away from home. I hope that I am able to keep my grades really good while also having fun and enjoying my college experience. I know that I am here to get an education, but it's obvious to everyone that college doesn't just teach you knowlege in your courses that are suppose to be preparation for your career, but it's also a learning experience for life lessons. I feel that just in the week and a half that I have been here I have already become more responsible and determined.      It has been kind of hard switching from not only my hometown to a new, huge city, but also from summer and relaxation and the feeling of ""yey school is over"" to ""wow, my life is just beginning, along with lots of studying that I don't really want to do. ""  My life has just been kind of awkward lately anyway. I know that things are suppose to change when you go off to college in so many ways especially through your habits and relationships and mine definitely has. The fact that my family has been going through changes of its own has made me feel somewhat distant and like I don't belong. Yet, the funny thing is that I don't really care or maybe it's that I don't know how to make the effort to fit in again. My first time to go home will be to a different home than the one that I've lived in for the past four years (even though I lived there when I was younger) and I feel like it will just be weird to see how my family's lives have just king of carried on without me. I won't really understand my mom's relationship with the guy she is dating or how my brother is experiencing or enjoying high school. My dad is perhaps the only one that I will probably still feel just about the same with because I am use to not seeing him all the time. My time is almost up and as of right now I am just really hoping that, even though I may not be showing my priority to God right now, he will really just step into my life and help me control it in the right direction. "
Tell me about yourself.,     I wonder if he is going to call me tonight. I wonder if he cares or if he just wanted some. I hate guys like that. why do I always fall for a guy and just end up getting hurt. Ray must really not give 2 shits about me. I gave him all of my heart and he just broke it. why are guys like that.

Tell me about yourself.,"What an evening!  I have every bad event that has taken place tonight on my mind right now because now I am in the worst mood. I went with my suitemate to pick up food from Taco Cabana. Everything was going good, but then we had to wait forever for our food. Then when we got to the window, we had to send her drink back because it was the wrong size. Finally, we got our food, and it was right. We drove back to our dorm. The Castilian has a very strange structure that they call their parking garage. I park on the end of the row, and it is almost impossible to get in to. After ten minutes, I finally got my car in my assigned spot. When we were getting out, she grabbed the food and I grabbed the two drinks. We had to wait forever forever for the parking garage elevator. FInally, it came and we headed up to our room. I stacked the two drinks on top of eachother and supported them with my chin as I attempted to unlock my door. As I was doing this, I even heard my suitemate offer to hold the drinks while I opened the door, but I just ignored because I thought I had them. I made it in the door successfully, but as I was going to set them down, I dropped both of them all over my area rug. Irate, I bent over to pick up all of the ice on the floor and I screamed how much I really wanted a soda since I haven't had one all week!  I knew I had to get my rug washed otherwise it would be stained. I proceeded to head down to the laundry room but realized I had forgotten the detergent. All the while, keeping in my mind that my food was upstairs getting cold. When I walked in to the laundry room, I whacked my hip bone on the door knob, and even as I type this, I can feel the bruise forming. I kept walking towards the washing machines and didn't notice a puddle of water on the floor. I slipped 3 times before making it to the machine. I was so mad by this time that I just decided to wash my rug without any detergent. Now, here I am sitting in my room so pissed about all the events. I get back in my room and the internet is not working!!  I realize that I am so sick of fighting with the Apogee people that run our internet connections in our dorm. So now, here I am eating the soggy nachos that I paid 6 bucks for. All I can smell is the food, but now I'm really not hungry. You should hear the neighbors across the hall making the situation all the more worse. Their TV or radio is really loud and I can hear it from here. Oh geez, now they're knocking on my door. ""Is your internet working?""  It just came back up a few minutes ago is what I told them. For a day that was going too good, it has now taken a turn for the worst. Now I am thinking about the phone call I just made to my mom a little bit ago after all the excitement. She did not offer me ANY words of advice!  ""Things happen!"" she said. Wow!  No kidding!!  I don't think anything else can go wrong, unless my internet decides to cut off while I am writing this. I look around my room and all I can see is a big mess!  As of right now, an optimistic attitude is way out of the question!  I'm seeing my WET school books on the ground as a result of the tumbling tower of drinks. WOW!! I think this is the worst mood I've ever been in!  My room is freezing, my floor is wet, my rug is down in the dryer (which I have to go get in an hour--great!), and my neighbors are a pain in the rear. My suitemate is playing sad music really loud and it is drifting in to my room. It is reminding me of an ex-boyfriend that I have back home!  He acts so funny sometimes. He thinks he is so hard to get when I know that when I go down there, he will come right back to me. He's been acting like such a jerk to me lately along with all the other losers that live back home. I was supposed to try to get a lot of things done on the internet tonight, as far as classes, and now I am completely set back. Nursing homework, psych writing assignment, and retrieving bio notes were just a few of many things that I was supposed to do. My stomach is growling because I am so mad. It gets like this when things go wrong. I HATE WHEN THINGS GO WRONG!!  My mom's words are ringing in my ears. ""Things Happen!""  ""I just got done telling dad how good of a mood you sounded in when I talked to you earlier!""  THen come my suitemate's words. ""Chill out girl!  It's going to be alright!""  I don't think that will EVER happen at this rate! "
Tell me about yourself.,"     it is often very cold in the Fac the smurf lab especially they call it the smurf lab because it's a student microcomputer facility the acronym and its meaning both absurdly out of date. the computers are new and black the keys crunching crisply under my sore and tired fingers sore and tired from a 3 hour lab drawing three dimensional models in a computer, changing materials, trying to get travertine to stick to cool, airy software. a man comes in (a boy a man) and sits at the computer I usually use but couldn't because his stuff was there. he pulls a sandwich out of a bag, readjusts his hat, takes a slow bite of the sandwich and gets back to work chewing and biting calmly and contentedly as if preparing for a long night which will require nourishment of a complete sort. complete nourishment completed with a drink of some brownish liquid like all other brownish liquids we drink as humans nearly indiscriminately. 4 minutes four minutes of aching arms and hands nerve cells firing the table to my brain, the itch on my right cheek to my brain, the cool air of the place to my brain. I love to write. I love to think in written form, to read the words in my brain, to think nothing but print if I can manage it. Not just in a case like this as if I ever had a case like this - but in all of my life, my every day. My speaking to others has quotation marks around it, descriptive ways of describing what I describe. I always want to write discribe and I don't think I ever have until now because always my mind ( the silent one, the one that doesn't think in word sounds or print) my silent mind stops my hand and puts an e there because it's right, because I knew that from the beginning but the part of my brain that lives in kindergarten, brown bear brown bear what do you see? - tells me so. No it tells me iiiii iii aye aye aye eye eye eye but it's eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. I live in an apartment on my own now I can barely get it out of my head because it was so beautiful when I moved in  bare clean white bright new and beautiful and I keep it so clean and I love that about the apartment and I love that about me. I love to keep it all perfect. any one in the world could walk in the door and other than my messy grammar of any one's and every thing's there would be nothing out of place. I could open the door to the world and there is nothing shameful lying about no dirty plates and cups no clothes on the floor no mess around the sink. It's all clean as I'd like my life to be and am so gradually making it. The separation of church and state - the separation of method and emotion. Somehow I now think of star trek - oh, vulcans. Those crazy vulcans. I loved the next generation but I could never stomach any of the other iterations- the other shows in the series. The next generation was so right - picard so venerable, so rarely stooping to kirks weaknesses or the others' stupidities. So french, so proud. they made this archae not anthropological finding of some skull of some ancient form of man (in real life, not star trek) and they goyt got some graduate student or artist or pro or whatever to make a cast and then cover it with skin and eyes and hair to recreate the face of ancient man and it accidently turned out to look like patrick stewart and everyone thought hey ancient man looked like patrick stewart and they said no it didn't it's just a mistake but it was a great funny mistake anyway. I think a lot about william and henry james. I just read portrait of a lady over the summer and then to read ab out william in the psych book was so great so great to think that brothers could accomplish noteriety in separate fields to think that greatness was inherited from their father but they still so outshone him. my father has a software company and employs a man named john stewart which I think of because of patrick. He (john) drives a brand new red car red what corvette that's it. a red corvette so new that at the corvette show they didn't have one and paid him to put it on display. did they pay him?  my ear itches. They used to say in elementary school if your ear itches someone is thinking about you who thinks about me. The boy in the chair I usually sit in is thinking about me because I see him glance up from time to time in the corner of my eye. He eats like a man watching football, chews with his mouth open swallows gulps too large to imagine. so close to done and I loved doing this because I never write anymore. s "
Tell me about yourself.,"     So the first week of school has begun and I am not ready at all!  I already feel like I am loosing my mind. Which is not a good way to start off the school year. I am taking some interesting classes though with what seem like some pretty cool professors. First, I am taking CMS 306M, which is a speech class, and that doesn't seem like it will be too hard. Then I am taking ECO 304K with an amazing professor. I am very excited about this class but I have heard that it is a little difficult so I will definatly have to pay attention and study. I am also taking a geography class about weather and climate and my professor is Troy Kimmel-the weather man!  So I am excited about that because he seems like a fun person!  I am also taking EDP369K which is a community service class. We have to do community service every week for at least 4 hours. I think the professor sets us up with backgrounds that are unfamiliar to us and then we go to this business/place and get to experience those things that we normally wouldn't. This class should be interesting. I think it will really give a good perspective of what other people have to go through and it will help me not be so selfish. This class is just something I need to take. Finally, I am taking your PSY class which I am very excited about as well!  Pennebaker seems very laid back and cool. With the music at the beginning of each class, etc. I don't know, I think I might surprise myself and acctually enjoy physcology (however that is spelled). I really need to catch up on my reading sometime soon. I am a sophomore so I am not as scared as I was last year. Last year I was very intimidated so I studied all the time and read every assignment that was passed my way-and in return I ended up with a 3. 888 (which my parents are enthused about!)  But this year I am not as intimidated, so that could either be a good thing or a bad thing. I just really need to get out of the summer mode where I go out every night and do nothing but work and party. I need to calm down and study/read a bit more than I am now. I think I will be okay though because school has only been in session for a few days. So hopefully Ill get my act together soon. Anyway, on a lighter note tonight was our first Chapter Meeting. That's right, I am in a sorority-Alpha Chi Omega-and I love it!  We just went through RUSH where we got all of our new members and they are absolutly amazing. My little Alpha Sis is the sweetest most cool girl ever!  She knows how to control her school work but she also knows how to have a good time!  I just love her. Next week we get our Chi Sis' and then a few weeks after that we get our Omega Sis' then at the end of that we get to chooose our Lil' Sis'-which will be ours for the rest of our college years. So this semester should be very exciting!  This year I am living in the AXO house with my pledge class of '03 and I wasn't so sure about it last year but I really love it!  I am getting to know my Pledge Class SO much better which really brings us closer and actually gives me the pride of calling them my sisters-however corny that may sound!  Haha. Anywho, we have a date dash on Thursday and I am not sure which boy to take!  haha. I always seem to have boy problems. But o well, that's all part of being a college student (I guess). Anywho, there is this one boy who is a Sigma Chi and is halarious and so much fun to be around. And really cute but then there is a Wrangler whos name is Matt who I kind of talked to last semester. He use to be our house boy and we even went on a date earlier before school started. Well even though he may be good to look at he really doesn't have much of a personality!  Which really sucks. I think he's just really shy or something but he always mumbles and doesn't have a whole lotta interesting things to say. I mean, don't get me wrong he is a super sweet guy and I tottally trust him. And he's 21 (haha). But I can't help it if I am not attracted to someone. I mean in reality personality is everything even if this guy is amazing to look at. But in a way I feel like I owe it to him to invite him to our date dash. But then again I don't want to lead him on and then ""break"" his heart. Because that's just cruel!  Okay, then there is another guy who reminds me of my ex-boyfriend (but in a good way). He is super cute and very interesting. I think I could hold several very interesting/intelligent conversations with him. I think he could teach me a lot about life in general. Anywho, my sweetmate introduced me to him and she really wants me to take him to this Date Dash and I would LOVe to go with him but I feel like I owe it to these other guys, that I have been spending more time with. So right now I am a very confussed person-and considering it is Monday night I kind of need to make up my mind really fast. Okay, so there's the Sigma Chi-names Forest-who is one of those guys that is supper fun but not long-term quality. Then there's Matt-the Wrangler-who is so nice but I would feel quilty leading him on by inviting him. Then there is Ryan who is someone I look very much foward to getting to know better. So we shall see how things go. I know everything happens for a reason so I will just follow my heart now and either way things will work themselves out!  Right??  Well, I have now been typing non-stop for 18 minutes. I guess I had a lot to get off of my cheast. This is a good assignment because it always us to do what we should do every day. just let it all out!  Haha, good idea!  O yeah, I tried signing up for an experiment project but then I realized I signed up for the wrong day so I hope that doesn't affect my grade. Whopps!  O well, there's nothing I can do about that now. This weekend is our first home football game which I am very excited about!  We play North Texas and we should whopp some beee-hind!  I can't wait~ "
Tell me about yourself.,"    Stream of Consciousness:  That time counter is very annoying, the videos that switched. a really good song just came on, I think it is by Mark Anthony. This office smells kind of funny sometimes. I met this Girl named Maria today and she is a runner for UT. I hope Parking and Transportstion appeals my ticket. I have some really random thoughts.  I want the best things out of life. But I fear that I want too much!  What if I fall flat on my face and don't amount to anything. But I feel like I was born to do BIG things on this earth. But who knows.  There is this Persian party today. My neck hurts. But I am excited about attending this party. The girl I like will be there. She is my ex. Btu it's all good. I hope she still has feeling for me. I woke up this morning with a terrible head ache.  I am wondering if I should invite my brother and hos friends to that party. I really wasn't invited myself, but I know Marjon will be there. I have some messages on my phone. How do you track feelings?  That must be hard to do. I feel good!  Healthy, kind of tired - but its morning time. I should call Janaina. I miss her. She is very cool. I hope no one actually wastes their time reading this. Because this stream of consciouness in BS. But it's ok. I guess I will learn something new from this class. I made a taks sheet for today. But I dought (is that how you spell that word?) I will finish everything on there. But I might. Life is much simpler when you have direction.  I need to get stated on my well logging  homework. I bet you guys don't even read this paper. I would be interested in seeing how people stucture this writing assignment. I mean, the way people form their paragraphs and stuff. As you can see I like writing paragraphs 3-4 sentences at a  time. Yeahhhhhhhhhhh, time is almost up. I am very glda to be done with is assignment. Thanks    "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now I am in my apartment with my two room mates and one of their girlalking to the friend and her friend. My roommate is wistling some weird tune while watching seinfeld and talking to the girls. My computer is writing unbelievably slow because of all these unbelievably uneccessary pop-ups. Speaking of unbelievable, how do you spell it?  Is it with an ie of ei whatever I guess it really doesn't matter. I just answered the door and signed for some package for my roommate. The delivery guy was chill, I like UPS. My roommate just put on a Dave Matthews dvd so at least I'm listening to some pretty sweet music. I am currently eating a cliff bar flavored chocalate brownie. It looks like predigested food, but at leats it taste fairly good. I just looked to my right and noticed my bike which I have not ridden since I got to Austin. Its a Hoffman Condor, which is a pretty sweet bike, I guess I should use it a little more. Me and my roommates rode are bikes around in the snow last year up in Chicago, that was tight. You would never imagine how hard it is to ride a bike on a frozen pond. My roommates girlfriend is doing her laundry at our apartment right now. Its cool. I just looked at my other roommate and thought about the incredibly easy week he has had. He goes to ACC and has no friday classes. He then skipped monday because he didn't have his car. Today he got out of both of his classes for some carnival they were having. He just asked me ""Travis where are we eating tonight. ""  That kind of funny because that for sure seems like the most important thing we have to do tonight. I love college. Dave is now playing Granny on the listener supported dvd and its kickin. I love this song. Dave and his boys rock it out in concert if you have never been. . GGGGGGGGGGOOOOOOOOOO. UT is turning out to be pretty sweet. I love the wide variety of people you get to see on a daily basis. My last school had 1200 students so I Knew just about everyone I saw, its a little different here, but its all good. Just looked at the timer and it looks like I got about 3 minutes left. Is anyone elses computer typing on like a 2 second delay?  Anyway its been fun writing in a constant stream of continual conscience or whatever its called. Phsycology is very interesting I really liked the lie detector test. Props to Michael for tricking that thing the second time around. Just looked at the kitchen, it looks pretty clean who would have thought?  One minute left that's really all I'm thinking about right now. The class dj is good with the tunes they seem to be a sweet mix. Talk to you later peace out whoever is reading this. Bye. "
Tell me about yourself., I am so happy I can't really explain how I feel just that I am feeling great. I know the reasons why I am so happy I just feel like telling everyone that I am so happy and I just want to smile a lot. I would but other students would probably freak but then that's okay cause there is to many people here in Austin that I don't think anybody would even remember the girl that told them that she was so happy. Anyways I have had so many hard days these past days butI think that I am going to be okay. I don't know why people don't even talk to other people unless they know them. Today I actually realized that eventhough austin is a big university I can make others see me. Okay right now my feet hurt so much I did so much walking today just like the other days. The difference is that I got blissters on my feet and they really hurt but you probably don't want to know that. Anyways I think I have lost weight because my pants fit me loose from when I bought them. Which is good because I usually don't loose weight or gain it just stay the same. Oh if I misspell a word I am so sorry but its just that when I am happy I can't really concentrate on spelling. I'll try not to make so many mistakes. I have gone back and captalized all the I's that weren't captalized. Right about now I feel my brain fried of so much thinking. So I met someone that can become a destraction in my education or can be the best thing that ever happened to be but I can't say who he is. Besides that I am really happy I feel like a new nickel very shiny through the inside and on the outside as well. All this happiness is thanks to God because he has not forgotten me of left me to survive on my own. So thank you so much Jesus because without you I would not be were I am today and who I am. I know that this might make someone feel unconfortable but that is how I feel and what I am thinking so no offence to no one in any way. I so wonder if my mom will come this weekened that would be so great but if she doesn't it's okay cuase I have her in my heart and in a DVD that my sister made for her. So any time I want to hear my mom's voice I just have to see the video and there she is that makes me more happy. I wish I could describe this feeling and share it with every one but I can't. It's great! Anyways my minutes are almost up but after this I am going to do other homework and get things done for tommorrow. I usually start early on things and wake up early to get other stuff done that's the way to do it. One teacher told me that if I wanted to get more of my stuff done to get up early and do them.   
Tell me about yourself.,"     So it is cold in my room it was like that last night too. I really have to go to the bathroom. wow I suck at typing I think it is because my fingers are cold. my feet are also cold too. I can hear the air conditioning blowing over my bed and my room. I'm so full right now-I just had lunch and it was good, but I was starving. Absolutely starting. I have this class today and I hope I don't fall asleep. I don't think I will because it is usually entertaining. I hope I am doing this right. Since I am typing, I am focusing on that and not on my main stream thoughts. I hope my friend Kacie is doing ok, she doesn't like her roommate and wants to transfer to Colorado where her brother goes to school. I can picture her sitting in her dorm all alone right now. Juliana is funny. we usually eat lunch together and it is fun. she is quiet and a lot of people might think she was a snob, but she isn't,just shy. TOnight I have a meeting to go to for 2 hours. that sucks. I wonder if my parents are going to come to UT this weekend. They said they might, but I'm going to the game on Saturday and I won't be in town on Sunday, so I guess we will see. Did I mention I have to pee?  I think I did. I took my ipod to class today, to biology, and listened to it on the way. It worked fine except I kind of felt like a snobby -conspicuous consumption- person while I was listening to my music. The white earpieces give it away. Everyone knows its an Ipod. I always am picturing the bus stop I walk past to get to class. how everyone is standing outside, waiting for the bus, the shadow of the trees' leaves on the ground in the hot August sun. Haha, I feel like I'm writing some romance novel or something. I have a lot of homework to do today, and I didn't do much last night. Now the refrigerator is making noises, but it always does. I think my roommate is at class. I haven't seen her at all today. I wonder what people downstairs are doing. this kid thought I was going to eat lunch with him because we just happened to leave the dorm at the same time to go to Kinsolving, but then I was meeting my friend. So I feel kind of bad, but he went on ahead too. Its not totally my fault. Some of my high school friends are out of school now. I have class till 5 then the NSC meeting till 7. blah. And I have a meeting tomorrow night, and a couple next week. This feels like high school again. I hope people will wait for me to go to dinner with them. Last night we went to jack in the box, and I hate fast food, so I got a salad. That's what I got when we went to Burger King last week, also. I would rahter eat at kinsolving then waste my Bevo Bucks there. Mmm. Thai food sounds good. My nutrition class is so boring. Today at lunch while I got my tacos and was fixing them, and while I got my fruit, I was thinking of my nutrition class and our teacher lecturing on and on. About fruits, vegetables, the servings we ned to have of each, that kind of of thing. I'm really tired all the sudden. My eyes are starting to close. I could take a nap before psych. But I probably won't. So I still have to pee. That's kind of gross and you won't want to know that but oh well. All my friends keep signing on to I'M but I can't talk to them because I am doing this. only 10 min. left! This reminds me of jogging on the treadmill at Gregory, with other sweating people watching Ellen or Regis and Kelly in the morning. I keep looking at the clock, praying the time will go faster so I will be done working out. Should I join crew? I might, my roommate is involved, and it would be a good way to work out, and it would be done so early in the morning. I just hesitate because I don't want to be exhausted all the time, which I could very well be. My friend James goes to OSU and he had a fro last year but he shaved it this summer. I like it better with the fro because he is a funny kid. I'm getting tired of this. I don't want Carpel Tunnel Syndrome or anything. I don't think I have actually ever typed for like 20 min at a time. the girl across the hall from me isn't very friendly. She is in my bio and chem classes and in my FIG also, but she seems kind of snobby and all like ""I'm too good to talk to you"". I keep thinking of my friend from HS who is in the psych class too. I saw her as we walked out on Monday and  I was like oh, hey. I'm thinking about breaking out my Thin Mints that my mom sent me right now. I wanted a cookie at lunch but they had cake. And cookies are so good. FOr some reason Kerry just popped into my head. what should I do about that? Should I vote for him?  I think it was because we did a psych. survey yesterday about Bush and terrorism. My fridge stopped making noises but the a. C still is. My arms are starting to hurt. Am I going to die? This weekend my brother and his wife came in town from Boston for a wedding and we hung out with him. We went to Barton Springs, it was fun. After, we got some tacos at this place for lunch. It was good. I can see us in line at the restaurant (as a baby I called it a restoot) waiting to order, me looking around, deciding what to get, if I wanted the drinks that were really good, they taste just like a fruit. We got a cantolope one and it was so refreshing. I have the worst posture. I'm trying to sit up now. My friend kc has a yoga strap she uses to keep her sitting up straight. Owww. my arms really hurt now. oh band, I was in band last year and I remember marching and all those friends I had from band. One of my friends who is a senior now has to go to practice today. He just signed online. Wow, only 2 more minutes!  Someone is slamming doors in my hall and I can hear people talking. There are some really annoying sorority girls and frat boys in my hall and they think they are so cool. One girl has they shorts that say sexy on the butt, and she is also in one of my classes. I'm not a huge fan of her. wow, that's mean. me just rambling on about the people I don't like. Ok, almost there. I feel like I'm running a marathon. I ran this morning. I'm proud of myself for exercising so hopefully I won't gain the freshman 500000. Then you would have to roll me home. I can imagine, rolling myself home past the Buccees in Giddings, the Exxon station and the little Beaver (Buccee himself) on the Exxon sign. ok I'm done, ow my arms hurt. I'm such a wimp. Now my prof is going to read this out loud and I'm going to be mortified, sinking lower and lower in my seat. please don't read aloud! haha. I know that won't happen. ok bye. "
Tell me about yourself.,"What do I write about? That is a good question, but I guess I should write about writing, or think about thinking. The thoughts streaming through my head right now mainly consist of how fatigued I am at the moment. I have been running around all day doing errands for the actives, and I just want to sit and do nothing. I guess this is almost doing nothing except for the movement of my hands and the flow of my thoughts. Part of my relaxation method at the moment is coming through my ears in the form of some music. Jimmy Buffet is streaming through my computer waves and out into my room. I wish I were sleeping and I wish I did not have to report to the house in about 40 minutes because I just want to do nothing right now. I don't feel that physically tired but more mentally fatigued. I did not have much class today, so I got to sleep in, but I could still use some rest. Perhaps I need to get outside and exercise to increase my energy in the future. I just don't have much open time with pledgeship at the moment for anything but class. I have been in school here for about two weeks, and I think it is really quite a cool set up. You don't have to go to class if you don't want to, but it certainly crushes your grades with low attendence. Sometimes the lectures are really quite boring, but this is never the case in Psychology, only my other classes. The biggest adjustment I think from High school to college is the format of testing with only a few test grades determining your whole grade. One of my annoying friends just walked in the room and is tearing up my room by bouncing a basketball. That guy is such a mess and I was not serious about the annoying part because he is cool, but now he exited the room to go find something exciting to do as opposed to watching some guy sit in his room and type on his computer. Let's see here, it has been 11 minutes of streaming thoughts and this is pretty fun. It is even more fun that this is not graded on content since surely my dull writing is sure to bore any living human. I am trying to search for thoughts, but I just realized that defeats the purpose of the exercise because there should be no interruption, just natural thoughts. All of the jimmy buffet music is taking me away to the beach and ""margaritaville. ""  I wish I were on the beach right now instead of at school, but its not all that bad. We have our own semi- beach environment with the river and other stuff around Austin. But now my hands are kind of aching because I don't think I have ever typed this long without taking a break. I am certain that I wil have great stamina in my hands when I am through with all of the writing assignments, and if it does nothing else, atleast my typing speed should increase significantly. It is pretty quite around here as opposed to like last night or other days  because usually a lot of people are hanging out in our room or playing loud music. I like this serenity with just me, my computer, and jimmy. I look up at the clock and see I am at the eighteen minute mark, and only two more minutes. I feel like this is some type of race, like a time trial or a running race in which I have 20 minutes to run as far as possible and must finish strong. This writing is not so painful as I though because I was sure that I would just go braindead and have nothing to say. I do have a lot to say but it might not be the most earth shattering writing. Looks like I am  out of time.        "
Tell me about yourself.,"     Ok, writing. I started this a few minutes ago but apparently in Mozilla Firefox the timer doesn't work. Sorry if I end up submitting two essays. Right now I'm kind of hungry. My stomach is growling, I haven't eaten since seven-thirty this morning. I didn't use to eat breakfast, but now I do. One minute down. I feel pressured, like I have to continue hitting keys or I'm not doing as well as I should on this writing assignment. Which is strange because all I have to do is write something, anything, and I get credit for it. Is it cheating if I use the backspace key to edit my mistakes?  There are quite a few of them. I probably would type better and therefore faster if I slowed down, which is paradoxical but true. I am also sleepy. Maybe I will take a nap, except I have to study. Hooray. That's a thing about college that is hard to get used to - setting oneself to a schedule and keeping to it, studying and going to classes on time without being told what to do. I'm thinking about psychology and the hypothalamus, which is what we learned about yesterday. The description of the rat kind of makes me wish I was a rat whose hypothalamus was being zapped. Seems kind of nice, although dying of starvation doesn't sound pleasant. Maybe in this case it does. I wonder what it's like. Maybe conscious though takes a backseat to simple feelings of pleasure, like humans feel sometimes, in the throes of ecstasy (religious, sexual, or chemical). Maybe the human brain has a natural resistance to feeling too much for too long in order to protect itself from things like dying of pleasure. Quite a way to go. I am running out of things to write about and it's only been 5:30 minutes. My mind is becoming a blank. Perhaps I can shove something in there. Nope. Rub a dub dub, three men in a tub. I'm regressing back to childhood, oh no!  Forced constant thinking seems to have brought me back to my childhood, which is not what I would have expected. If you think about it, that nursery rhyme is kind of suggestive. I wonder why I keep bringing up images and thoughts from when I was young?  Perhaps those, being learned first, form the basis of the psyche and are therefore more intrinsic to the mind than say, what I learned yesterday or what I see on MTV. MTV. I do not like that channel at all. I do not like it in a boat, I do not like it with a goat. I do not like it, Sam I Am, I do not like Music Television. The channel that proclaims to be that of rebels and anti-culturalists, but is really the mainstream mass-produced mass-consumed product that everyone thinks it is rebelling against. At least they encourage people to vote. That's a positive message coming from a negative source. I guess no one or nothing is truly evil. Well, nine minutes gone. I'm feeling stretched, like butter spread over too much bread, as Bilbo put it. Like everything in my mind has already come out and I'm squeezing a juicebox trying to suck the dregs of thought through that straw. Of course, with a juicebox you can never quite get out all the liquid, and I suppose it's the same with the mind. One thing I never understood about the mind is how one gets from neurons firing and connecting with each other to actual consciousness. In the textbook it seems like a step is skipped. An analogy can be made (and has been, I assume) between the mind and the computer. One could say, well, magnetic information doesn't seem at first glance to represent data and images and text. But the former is converted into the latter by programs, which themselves run on magnetic data. Where are the programs in the mind?  It's hard to believe that the human mind just coincidentally has the neurons in all the right patterns to be able to form speech and thought and movement. Where is the software?  I'm just rambling now. Although that's the purpose of this paper, isn't it?  Ha ha. I tried to read the book House of Leaves, I was told it was brilliant, but you know what?  It, for lack of a better and more descriptive and more culturally acceptable word, sucks. It's written in a nonfiction style, but the endless footnotes serve only to distract from character development and this won't make much sense to whoever is reading this if they haven't read it. Speaking of which, Hello, whoever is reading this!  I hope you're having a wonderful day. Although reading hundreds of stream of consciousness papers is not my idea of a wonderful day. Still, someone's got to do it, right?  Someone's got to do all the dirty jobs in the world, until they design an automated way to do it. Then the worker loses their job. Which is better, I wonder-- working at a terrible job, or being replaced from that terrible job and not working at all?  Some day, hopefully, we will have robots to do all our terrible jobs for us. We will become like Asimov's Solaria - thousands of robots to maintain a small human population. Eventually it will go to extremes -- millions of robots to one human. Or maybe not. What will be the point of civilization then?  What is the point of it now?  To keep people happy?  Great job so far, I must say. Nowadays people think that what they need to be happy is chemicals. More and more chemicals, pills, etc. to cure the imbalances in their head. They should take a cue from computer repair people -- the problem is just as often in the software as in the hardware!  Biological psychology will go a great deal in explaining human behavior, but it can only go so far. People who have no imbalance in their minds but still do terrible things or get depressed - what do we do with them?  Eighteen minutes, fifteen seconds have passed. Quite a while to be writing. You know, a second never seems so long as when you want it to be short. I love time's relativity, even though this isn't really an application of it. If only there was a way to have time speed up or slow down if we wanted it to -- now there would be a best-selling invention. It all deals with people's perception anyway -- I bet there is a way, somewhere. Although messing with brains like that probably isn't a good idea. Speaking of good ideas, my time is just about up. It's been a pleasure. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Right now I am in my room trying to study. I really don't know how to study at all. I'm way behind in all my reading cause it's so boring. Micah is printing something right now. I am so bored. I want to go home tomorrow, but I'm not done with my reading so I really can't do anything until I'm done with that. Plus I don't know whose going to pick me up if I could go home. Homer said he was going to find a way to come and get me, but I don't know if it's possible. They said there is this race they are going to on Sunday and I really would like to go. Gosh this seem to be forever to type. I really miss my mom, but when I'm around she's always yelling at me. I don't enjoy my time with her. Every time we get into an agrument I feel bad afterwards cause I know she might not be around for very long. I love her so  much I just wish we can hang out and do what other family does and be happy. My sister is not talking to her right now because of what happen last week and I wish it never did happen. I would be aleast happier to talk to her everyday. She seem to always cry when I do talk to her. My life seem to suck comparing to all the other people. Micah is standing here right now watching me type. Right now I'm looking around room. My roommate is making me nervous, she was looking at me type. I think we need to start cleaning our room cause we have books and stuff everywhere. I miss Juan, he went back to califorina for the Marines and he has not called me since the last time. It's been like a week. I've been feeling a little dumb around UT cause everyone seem to be so smart. Even my friend Sarah feel this way. Maybe I just don't belong here with all the smart people. I'm a poor person, and it just make it worst to see that most of the people that goes here are rich. They talked about how they are going to get a piece of land and build their house and have lots and lots of parties. I don't know if I can even afford a house right now. My mom lives in an apartment and she barely make enough to pay for all the bills. I feel like I'm using all her money going here. I love her so much. She's always been here for me even if we get in fights. My life would have been better if I have my dad around. He doesn't even seem  to care if I'm alive or not. He never sent us anything. The only thing that I get from him is a child support paycheck, which I don't really care for. I need money, but it always come  and go. And it sure doesn't make me happy. Homer really likes me but I don't know him enough to go out with him. Is that bad?  For some reason I still like Isrel, but he's just the type of person that want girls for sex. He wanted to take me home this one day, but I said no. I don't like people looking at me like I am a hoe, because I know I'm not a hoe. My mind is blank right now. To me life just seem to suck. Isrel seem to be a non commitment person, and I wish he was because I would like to go out with him and be with him.  I guess I just like the idea that   I like him and if we get together and get marry someday he would be able to support me and make me happy. My goal right now is to  do good in school and build a great career for myself and prove to my friend's that I can graduate from UT if I try my best. They keep on telling my that I'm wasting my money going to UT because it's much cheaper when I go at home. I just always wanted to go to UT and here I am  following my dreams.  I'm trying to find a job right now but it seem so hard. So many people are searching for jobs and I'm out of luck. I think I might switch my bank to bank one because they have free checking account and the one I have with bank of america isn't free. After this I need to start reading  all of my books I wonder how far I'm going to get before I decide to go do something again. I'm almost done I have less then a minute now. I really enjoy my psychology class. It's one of the best class I have here at UT so far. I just hope I'll do good. My goal is to do good and get into the nursing major. "
Tell me about yourself.,"    Sleep! That's what I need to do. I stayed up all night writing my freshman seminar paper on Bond- Born an electric quartet. I asked my roommate that I was going to get some shut eye for about 10 minutes and to wake me up for my class at ten, but she woke me up 40 minutes later. I wasn't late. Thank GOD! I'm really stressed out, I have so many things to do this weekend. Why is college so easy yet so hard to manage. Management, I believe, is the biggest thing in college. I miss my family so much. I really don't know if I'm doing this right. I'm trying to type so fast that my hands are shaking and I'm pressing the wrong keys. Grrr! My roommate is leaving today to see her family. Good for her. We were both crying, actually I was the only one come to think of it. She said she never cries even if it is the saddest thing ever. How can you not cry. I guess I'm very emotional and sensitive. I was sick last weekend and when my parents came up to see me they were really worried. I hope they are healthy and son't worry so much. I want to see them and my brothers so bad. I'm done with classes and I'm free!! I love the feeling of writing in streams of consciousness. It is probably one of my favorite past times besides playing and composing music. I really want to be super good on my electric violin. After writing my paper about the electric quartet, I realized that I wanted to be like them. I actually miss my quartet. They all went to the University of Chicago and are sophomores there. I'm always the youngest in everything. youngest in my graduating class, among my friens, at my church-- that is youth bible group, and even among the freshmans here at UT. I feel so old yet so young compared to others here. I can't believe that there are 30 maybe even 40 year olds in my calculus class. I was so shocked when several older males came and sat in our lecture. They are older than my professor and TA's. What are they doing here at such a old age, I wonder. Did they flunk, not graduate, drop out and then realize many years later that school is the best place to be! I was walking out of PCL after studying late and this homeless guy walks up and asked for money. I ignored him because I was creeped out. It is my belief that if a homeless is not missing any limbs and is perfectly capable to work then he/she should. However, if they are missing an arm or let's say play the saxophone on the street, I would definetly give them some change. I feel that they are doing their best with the disabilities facing them. Last night, my roommate came in with her best guy friend, who's bi-sexual, and another guy that I later found was gay. I really don't mind gay guys although I find it sad, I DO MIND if they are lesbians!! YUCK! I'm a strong christian girl so it really is hard for me to cope with such things. I am very conservative and tend to not change my views for anyone unless the provide convincing evidence. I really want to keep writing on and on but I have 2 minutes left. I love to write especially poems. I like being creative and connecting with my inner feelings. I guess it is because I play classical music and only listen to classical music. Classical music, I think is the most sensuous, expressive and beautiful form of art every created. I would love to whip out my violin or go to a grand piano and play songs after songs. I better wrap up--oh no--it's almost time for me to go. I'll---phew--the computer is letting me write a little more. Whoever is grading this is really going to enjoy reading everyone's writing. Well, I got to head off to my Biology study group. Toodles! "
Tell me about yourself.,"I didn't sleep at all last night and I'm barely making it through my day. I feel like a zombie, but hey what's new?  I have an english paper due on Monday. I think I completely bombed the thesis. I guess I can always go back and change it. I'm tired, I can't think. that's a lie, of course I can. it will simply be rambling nonsensical jumble. and that counts too right? sure it does. I've been seeing this guy. he's about seven years older than I am, and that shouldn't be that big of a deal, but it's more of an age difference than anyone I've dated before. I can meet him on an itellectual level, conversation isn't lacking, there's physical attraction and the whole deal. so why am I so doubtful? I suppose because I'm paranoid about becoming an obnoxious needy stereotypical girl. Unfortunately I have been that to others in the past and refuse to ever play that part again. I'm so much stronger now, more confident and comfortable with myself as a person. Anyway, my point is I'm scared to let him know I'm sincerely intersted because I think it will freak him out and send him running in the other direction. I can make my intentions known without actually verbalizing my feelings. And I'm pretty sure at this time in the relationship- whatever time it might be- is too soon to bring up any of those concerns. Is he seeing anyone else? Does he care? Does he not want to hurt my feelings so he won't tell me he doesn't want to hang out? it's so ridiculous to hear myself think like this. basically I'm so afraid of rejection that I'm willing to do it myself, before anyone really gets the chance. I've dated a plethera of losers over the past year and I'm tired of not caring about anyone. anyone in that way I guess. yes I have friends and have plenty to do without a guy to entertain (that sounds really harsh- it is me that wants this. )but I miss that connection. I want to be in love again. but who doesn't? I suppose once I stop wanting it I'll find it. that's the way of the world sometimes. yeah but about him. it is what it is and if it doesn't work out than so be it. plenty of fish in the sea and all that. but he does have some potential. enough of this. it's making my head hurt. I don't like that my stream of consciousness has turned into more of a ""dear diary"" than anything else. I'm sitting in the student microcomputer facility among my fellow longhorns at the moment. I wonder how many of them are doing this assignment right now. maybe none. everyone's in their own little worlds. deep inside their thoughts or their research. everyone seems so disconnectced, though I suppose that's the point of this place. a quiet area to get work done, not social hour. I'm about to go to ecology evolution and society. I've been reading the assigned chapters, but I fear that I'm not actually retaining any of the information. I guess it will become quite apparent when I get my first test scores back. all I want to do here is to do well. it's the only reason I'm living in austin again, to continue my education. so that's what I aim to do. make the most out of the billion things I have to accomplish today. cross them off my list and get them out of the way in order to make room for all the new. life is pretty enjoyable when you don't let it drag you down with the minor negative aspects. so many people do that. drown in their own self pity and reamin miserable regardless. just smile sometimes, it really can make you feel better, and probably someone else as well. that's what I think, but this mind of mine is all over the place and never seems to rest. the end. my time is up.                            "
Tell me about yourself.,"     Ok, I'm thinking about a whole lot of nothing, and unfortunately since I've been told I type rather fast the professor to teacher's aid will now have to suffer through the horrible task of reading through the unintelligable thought processes of Mark's mind. I hope that no one reads this seriously at all. Ok now someone is watching me type, oh they're gone. That was fast, I'm telling you this is a waste of time and I'm not going to reveal anything special during twenty minutes. I'm actually kind of depressed at the fact that twenty minutes of my own un-interrupted thought would yield so little. I miss my wife. Yeah that's right my wife. We aren't legally married but we would like to consider ourselves married and I do. I certainly hope that no one bothers to mock my idea of marriage because I actually do take it very seriously. I love her more than life, more than anything else in this world and if anyone dares to mock that love or try to deny my marriage to her as real they will have to deal with my constant and thorough wrath. Now I'll write about pizza hut. They got this buffet that's only 3. 99, not bad, but the same as cici's so if they're pizza is not far superior than I will be terribly angry at them for advertising such a horrible deal. I know that was kind of in the middle of nowhere and I will admit that something someone else just said nearby me did actually influence that statement. I hope that this world is a peaceful place for my children I will do whatever I can to ensure this. I love my wife so much. I miss her terribly. There seems to be no longer a thought in my mind except how I have many a time disputed the reality of free will. How can one expect to have something called free will then expect to be judged finally. Because if I had full free will I could have chosen not to be exposed to the information that I would be judged for my actions on earth. But since I couldn't choose whether or not I could be exposed to such information. I am a Catholic. This is a stated fact that some might take as foolish words of a foolish person. But the truth is that I consider myself a part of this religion yet I do not completely agree with all of the aspects of the religion. For example the idea that all gay people will go to hell is foolish to me. My idea of who goes to heaven and who goes to hell is this:  Good people go to heaven. Bad people go to hell. Simple right?  Except what I qualify as a good person is different from what other people think is good. So what now?  Is my idea of good right or is theirs. But wait, the plot thickens. I have a solution to such a simple and timeless problem. You see I believe that God instilled in every human being the basic concience in that discerns between bad and good. The most amazing thing about this theory of mine is that if someone does something I find to be unacceptable I can be certain that they also think it is unacceptable. I am almost always right in this aspect. Every time I have seen something I think is wrong I can eventually approach the person about their actions and they will almost always agree with me that what they did is wrong. However, they will also go as far as to explain their good intentions. The hardest part of that aspect of the conversation is that it becomes difficult to discern between who is just self-delusioned and who genuinely had good intentions. I am not proud of all that I've done in my life. The only reason I can adopt a theory of shared thoughts of what is right and what is wrong is because I apply this theory to myself and find it to be true. I once actually cheated on one of my ex-girlfriends. One of the worst days of my life. There is no reason I can use to explain my actions. But I did it to end the relationship. Yeah, I know what you're thinking. Good job huh?  Well she didn't want to leave anyway. At least that was what I thought. I was so damn confused. I cheated on her, a rule I set for myself a long time ago was that I would NEVER cheat on a girlfriend. And I did. I disgraced myself and I hate. Er hated myself for it. I did it to invoke another of my rules for myself. Should an infraction upon the rule about NEVER cheating on my girlfriend I must then break-up with her because she deserves better than that. I don't know if I'm wrong. But I could be. Man you know sometimes music can just totally change one's mood. Now I'm listening to Damien Rice. The little known writer of some of the best music I've ever heard. I think he's great. It's kind of weird I guess for a guy to like some other guy's music so much but I do. I also like this guy Joseph Arthur a lot because both of these artists seem real to me. Their style of singing their lyrics are all so real. I love the way I can relate to it. I recently read ""A streetcar named desire"". The female role of blanche. She is like my ex. She lies, decieves in the name of giving people what they ""want""  NEVER tell me what I want. Only I know that and I don't appreciate being told. If anyone ever makes assumptions about who I am before I meet them. I get reasonably angry but I hide it pretty ok. You. For some reason I have been descrimanated against for being Mexican twice in my life. Both times by a girlfriends family. I have an extraordinarily pale complexion. The funny thing about that is one of them is Mexican. Heh what can I say. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Well, I'm not exactly sure what to write about. I just finished my prescreening for the Psychology Experiment stuff and I now have to 1. 5 credits for it. So I only have to get 3. 5 more I guess to get the 5. I hope the experiment things aren't anything to bad and they don't take that long. I hate typing when I have rings and bracelets on. I really like to wear jewelry but they just start to hurt me when they rub up against the keyboard holder thingy. I don't know how I'm going to be able to write straight for 20 minutes. I just took my bracelet off, it was really hurting. I have so much homework to do this weekend. I guess teachers (professors) think that since it's a long weekend we shoudl have time to do all kinds of stuff so they give us more work. I guess the professors don't realize that each teacher gives us more and we would like to have some free time too. I also have to go to all kinds of places this weekend. I have to go to Dallas to see my half sister because she's in the hospital for something, I really don't want to go though. We never talk anymore and why should I go see her when she can't even call me when she promises to. Oh, I met these friends at UT. They are so great. One of them really. Her name is Sarah and she's really nice. I think we might try to get an apartment together next year so we can live together and not have to put up with stupid roommates like the one I have this year. She lied to me about everything and I think she might be doing some kind of drugs or something. The other day I heard her talking to some friends about sniffing some kind of chemicals in some guy's dorm. I don't know what they were talking about, that is just what I heard. Carol is talking about Sarah right now to my dad while my mom is sleeping. She thinks Sarah is so cool. I wonder if what I eat is actually eating a lot or if I'm just eating a normal amount of food. I try to eat 3 meals a day even though the food isn't always great. Oh, Kinsolving isn't all that great. Some of the food is good, but I can't stand eating there every day. They need to have food on this campus other than chicken. I love chicken and I used to want it all the time, but now since I've been here I've been dying for beef. The other day I was so stupid. I was talking to Carol on the phone and I said, ""I'm tired, but I don't want to lay down. I'm bored but I don't want to do anything. I'm not hungry, but I'm dying for meat. ""  I bet I sounded so stupid. I drove home today from Austin. I really didn't want to becuase I haven't drove anywhere in like a month, but I really need to start driving again. I can't wait till I get to go to Casa Ole again. I can't believe Austin doesn't have them here. That is like the stupidest thing in the world. I take that back. The stupidest thing in the world is that UT doesn't sell Dr. Pepper anywhere!  How can they do that!  If you ask any person our age what soft drink they would prefer, the majority of them would say that they like Dr. Pepper the best. My mom just woke up. I finally found one places on campus that has it though. The Union has Dr. Pepper at the Taco Bell. I haven't checked anywhere else yet. My dad is talking about this guy's truck that got stolen today. I can't believe that happened. They live in a pretty good part of town and nothing like that ever happens here. My dogs are fighting. I have two dogs, Milo and Brewser. Milo is a red beagle that is Brewser's son and he turned a year old May 15, 2004. Brewser is a black beagle that turns 11 on October 11, 2004. It's weird to think of their age. Milo is really crazy and Brewser is really calm. It probably is because he is so old though. I felt so stupid today in Biology. We had to work in these small groups and figure out these questions the teacher told us to do and for the first question, I sort of knew the answer but I didn't have it completely right. The second question was to figure out the hypothesis out of a group of statements but it was hard. When I was in high school we were always told to write a hypothesis in ""If, Then"" form. Meaning that this would be an example, ""IF we put this together, THEN this should happen. ""  In this class though, its just a statement. No ifs. No thens. No questions. It just made me feel stupid cause I could pick the hypothesis out of the group. There there was the last question that she asked and I had no clue about it. All that really scared me though because I am afraid of not making it in Austin here at UT. Out of my high school we had 106 seniors. Out of those 106 there were 59 that went to college or went to some trade school or ARMY. Out of those 59, 35 went to aTm. I can't get over that. Only 2 of us came to UT and that is me and my ex boyfriend, Nathan. I am afraid of what all my aTm ""friends"" would say if I couldn't make it here. I really don't know what to talk about. I keep making all these stupid noises just because I can't think of what to say. My sister is now watching Who Wants to be a Millionaire and my dad just ate some M&Ms. My mom is out feeding Milo and Brewser. Oh, Milo is actually mine. I was too young for Brewser to actually be mine so he is actually my mom and dad's. Carol has a dog, ferret, and fish at her house in Temple. The dog's name is Bart. Carol is laughing at me because she is reading what I am writing and she thinks this is the stupidest assignment in the world. I have to say, that since I've been writing it, I have to agree. I think it's kind of cool, but I really don't see the point in having to write this all out. Well, I understand that it is cool to see how the mind thinks and how our brain processes information, but this sort of seems like a waste of time. Oh, well. I'm getting credit for it. Oh, I might get to go to my first concert pretty soon. I'm going to try to get to tickets to the Austin City Limits thing. Sarah and Gabby were telling me about it and while I was in class today they tried to go get tickets. Gabby got one but while Sarah was in line, they cut everybody off like 3 people in front of her. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     I'm just sitting here in the library wondering if this semester is going to get a lot harder. Everyone of my friends is struggling in some way or another. I keep asking myself whether or not I'm am going to make it in my major. My major is petroleum engineering and its not exactly the easiest major. My friends say they don't know what I got myself into, but I keep telling them I'll be fine to not worry about me. When I say this I am just trying to reassure myself instead of trying to convince them that I will be fine. This library is all to silent I think I just want to make some noise but that would be wrong to mess up all these people who just feel there barely grasping the concepts of what they are doing. While I'm sitting in the library my mind keeps wondering whether or not I am going to make an A on the chemistry exam on Tuesday. I feel bombarded with chem and I don't know if I am going to be able to remember all three chapters. My mind keeps telling me that I will be fine that I just have to get used to it. High School was so much different than college in that you had to much time you didn't know what to do with it. That hasnt been my problem lately the only problems I have had all are about having not enough time. Every time I talk to my girlfriend back home, a senior in high school, I tell her to take advantage of having a lot of time on her hands because college is no where near as easy. I know older people had told me the same but I really never believed them and always felt as though they were exagerating. Oh yeah I am getting off topic but this library is just boring me. I feel that everyone is ahead of me on everything. I feel like they all grasp the ideas that I don't. In high school I was ahead of everyone of my friends but now it seems to me like all of my friends are ahead of me. Maybe that's just me overthinking. I can now smell some food as though somebody has brought something into the library. It smells like a piece of chocolate. Maybe it is a candybar of some sort. I don't really care because that smell kind of nauseates me. I am not a real big fan chocolate but I do love chocolate ice cream. Something about the sweetness is to much for me to endure. Lately I have been getting really home sick because of my girlfriend. I miss her very much and wish she would move up here right away. SHe is graduating a semester early from HS and is going to move to austin and attend ACC for the remainder of the year. I offered for her to move in with me and she said she would ask her parents. I hate to say it but her mom is a good for nothing lazy ass. Her father moved from italy to america in the early seventies with not a dollar to his name. The man now owns a 30 million dollar business that he started from nothing. He now works twelve hour days and then comes home to make a three course italian meal, not spaghetti out of the jar, for the whole family while the mom just sits on her computer or plays tennis all day. All she does is just bitcht at the whole family to do things. She is one of the most ungrateful people I have ever encountered in my whole entire life. People who have only met her once or twice do not agree because she puts on a show for them but I see the real her everyday. "
Tell me about yourself.,"Today was a long day. I have been going none stop on about four hours of sleep. Chemistry 301, I have found, is really kicking my butt. I made a seventy on the quiz, but I think I could have done a lot better. Tonight I'm going to go see Shrek 2 with Andres and the guys. I can't remember if it is any good or not, but I guess I'm going as an excuse not to do my homework. One day I will get around to reading chapter three in psychology. This weekend I'm taking Bethany to Oklahoma to go see Bradley and Jon for Brad's birthday party. Oklahoma City is such a far drive from here. I think that it will take me about seven hours to get there but then I have to drive another thirty or so minutes to Edmund for the actual party. I'm going to meet Mom Sunday afternoon on the way home for a nice home cooked meal. I haven't had one of those for so long. Well, actually Tim's mother cooked us fajitas and lasagne last weekend when we went to Mexico, but that is not the same as my mom's cooking. After the UNT vs. UT game on Saturday, which might I add we kicked their butt, about eight of us loaded up and decided to go to Mexico spur of the moment. Tim's parents have a house in Laredo. His dad works for A&M International University as an athletic director. Hmmm. I am running out of things to talk about now. October 8th, is the Aubrey homecoming football game and my friend Niki has to crown this year's queen so I'm going home for the weekend to see everyone. I miss everyone a lot but I don't as much as I thought that I would. High school was great but college is so much better. Although, I would have to say that even though I was the valedictorian and I didn't have to study that much in high school, college is so much more difficult. I think I'll probably change my major a few times too. I know for sure that I want to do something in the medical field with children but I have no idea what I want to major in before I get there. And would my phone quit freaking beeping at me so I can finish this assignment!  Ok its just Andres wanting to know if I am going to watch Shrek 2 at Jester tonight at 8. I wish that I could have went to party on the plaza today but I had so much to do it was nearly impossible. I had a TIP mentor meeting at 5, which is when my last class ended but I had to cut that an hour in a half short to go to a TIP seminar that was about notetaking. Now how boring is taking notes about notetaking. That is almost as bad as the seminar I have to go to three times a week. Critical thinking is thinking about thinking. YUCK!  Couldn't the writers of the book think of something just a little more creative than that. I mean who wants to sit in lecture first thing in the morning and listen to a speech about what it means to be a critical thinker. Anyways, then I left the notetaking seminar early to go to Women in Medicine. The speaker there talked about how she had a stroke and was no longer allowed to drive and her vision was now impaired. I couldn't imagine having my driving privledges taking away from me and not being able to see. I have 20/20 vision right now but that doesn't mean that I'm a good driver. I have fallen asleep at the wheel twice in two weeks. Two weeks ago I went to Dallas to go see my friends in a band and I ended up staying in Waxahachie until 8 in the morning. When I was coming home the next day I stopped and got coffee before I headed out but sure enough about thirty minutes later I dozed off. I had to stop at a truck stop and sleep in my car for awhile. I can't believe I keep doing that. It is so dangerous and just last week a girl from my home town died in a car wreck when she was coming home and hit a tree. My Dad called this weekend, which is odd considering he just decided to flee last Christmas and not tell anyone where he was going. He said he had a dream about me and he was just making sure I was ok. I'm not sure if that was an excuse to talk to me or if he really had a dream. The reason why I wonder that is this past year all my dreams have been coming true and it is so weird. If he had a dream about me that was bad will it come true too?  Maybe it is a weird genetic thing and we have dreams that foretell the future. . just kidding. Ok well here is the countdown. I only have about 30 more seconds to type so any second now it is going to stop me. Ok my time should be about up now. Yeah ok I'm done. . The End! "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am so ready to go home and see my family and friends. I have never really ever been by myself for this long. It would not be so bad if I had at least one familiar face around but I really don't. I am trying to get to know my roommates better but I guess it is not the same as knowing people and going to school with them for years. In my small town we will be friends forever but here I am not so sure. I really hope I can get involved with the church here. I think that will help a whole lot. I want to be involved in a spirit organization but the whole ""lets get drunk at every social event"" really bugs me. Why can't people just have good clean fun? I love the team and the school but I can have a great time supporting them without getting drunk, high or having sex! Anyway I am looking forward to seeing the familiar. I love it here and am gload I came but I am looking forward to next weekend. I am really ready to see aron and my other friends. This has been the longest we have been separated. I pray though that if we can make it being apart that we will be together forever. I love him so much. We can talk about anything. It is great. We share so many things in common. He loves God and that means the most to me. It is a real balanced relationship. Wow I cannot believe it has only been 7 minutes. It feels like an eternity. I have so many other things to be doing like spanish and reading for other classes. I am kind of nervous aout my classes. My major is Spanish and I am not so good at it yet. Hopefully it will come with more practice. Wow this retreat this weekend with the church is going to be great. I cannot wait. I am so ready to be around people and meet people. I want to build good lasting relationships instead of just aquatances. It is kind of lonely with just saying ""hi how are you?"" and then nothing past that. O well. I hope I am doing well in school. I don't just want to be here, I want to thrive here. I want to be the best that I can be with everything I do. I want to be proud of myself and I want others to be proud. I like having lectures and tests as apposed to homework, quizzes and tests. But then again, if I mess up on a test it will be hard to get my grade back up. I am shooting for A's but one or two B's would not be awful. But I am studying for A's. I need to start working out. I have been sick though but I need to start again. Maybe someone might like to go with me. It is always better with someone else. I am looking forward to be married, hopefully to aron, becuase we can do these things together becuase we both enjoy the same things. I also wish Josh was here, it would be so much easier. Hopefully he will get into college here and we can hang out more together. He is like a brother to me and will always be. I really miss him. Hopefully he will call back but I guess I will just call him again. Well these are all the things  I have been thinking about for the past couple of weeks. I think about these things all the time and just think it has only been 16 minutes. I wish all writing assignments were this easy. I need to sign up for more experiments so I don't get behind. I also need to do some passoffs. Hopefully if I study them well today I can do one tomorrow and one thurs and then one friday and the only have 12 left. That would be good. I wonder who is all coming home for homecoming? probably most people. I love my little town. I would not trade it for the world. Those that have lived there their whole lives don't appreciate it as much as I do but they will some day. I am really glad my mom married walter and that we moved there. I like it that I live here cause my dad visits a lot. My family is awesome. They do so much for me and I thank God I have them. You know another thing that bugs me about here is that so many people are liberals. What is this world coming to?  I am so voting for Bush! "
Tell me about yourself.,My thoughts are everywhere right now I am thinking about getting my computer fixed because it has a virus. I need to sleep that is the biggest change for me in college is the late nights and busy days I am used to busy days from high school but not the late nights. It is strange but interesting and fun being semi independent I have another late night tonight that I am not quite ready for but it is my pledge line for KA which will be another consumer of much of my time but it should be very fun once pledgeship is finshed I am looking forward to getting to meet and become close with my pledge brothers because being from a smaller town I don't know as many people as a lot of folks down here but I didn't want go to school with all my old high school friends  really because I wanted to meet new people I do miss my best friedn though he is somebody I could always talk to trip out with and just we knew what we are thinking without having to say anything it is strange not having a best friend down here right now and its tough because it takes lots of time and lots of escapades and wild nights bad times good times high school sports all those things made us great friends and now I have to try and make some more friends like that here in austin my roommate  just left and I am still trying to make my decision about that situation he is an alright guy but he is not really the type of person I see myself spending lots of time with but I am sure I will being roommates and joinin the same fraternity but I always look at it as it could be a lot lot worse. lost my train of thought sorry I'm having trouble focusing today I feel very out of it but I've got class in a while so I won't be able to take a nap I think I am getting sick and rundown hopefully I can shake this little congestion I have but with all the new stress in life these days I don't know how well that will work out I'm not feeling to great at all sometimes I wonder if UT is the right place for me and that is just a backand forth thought cause some days it is and some times when its a bad day I wish I was back home in my own bed with dog I miss her haha that sounds so cheesy haha but she is a good dog and she always will cheer you up I can hold a thought today it seems like I feel like I am being random but some how I feel like I keep saying the same things I am not looking forward to walking to class I don't like that very much and I get to search for the computer shop to drop my laptop off to get this virus taken care of that is a pain I feel like I havent met enough people yet I want to be more outgoing but I am naturally more of a quiet person I enjoy listening and watching other peoples behaviors and stuff I like to feel people out and get a sense of who they are before I just start relaxing around them I try to be assertive and approachable and outgoing but that doesn't always go so well and people take my quietness in the wrong way it is often seen as me being stuck up angry rude and that drives me crazy but all I can do is be who I am        
Tell me about yourself.,"     I enjoy doing writing assignments liek these. You get to write about just about anything that pops into your mind. the bad part about this type of assignment is when you really don't have anything to think about or when you have a brian fart. I wounder just how my performance in this class is going to be. Whether I will do poorly in the class or good or just average enough to pass the class. But among those thought, I also wounder how this semester is going to go. I hope that I am going to be able to do well enough to bring my GPA up so that I am able to get more scholarships fo next year. Man, when I notice what I am thinking about, I notice that I really think about things that may affect me in certain ways. Like doing homework for my classes or whether or not I'm going to have enough money to pay my rent or my cell phone bill or my other bills. But as I take the time to think, I feel that I will be forced to get another job so that I will be able to afford all this new responseablity that I have taken on. Its not always easy to write exactly what your thinking about a certain time. But right now its hard for me to do anything when all I'm thinking about it how bad I feel right now. Right now I have a stuffed and runny nose, and I am also sore from working out on wensday. It hurts for me to walk up the stairs or to strech out of to even lift up anything heavy. I think I worked myself out a little too much, I feel that I tried to push myself a little more then I should have since it was my first day working out since last semester. I think I screwed myself by not continuing to workout over the summer break. All I did was work to pay off some of my bills that I acquired over last semester for books and other various reasons. Its funny how when you set yourself to doing something and son't pay attention to the time, time really seems to fly by. Take this assignment for example. I started to write what I was thinking and now that I look at how long I've been writing, I've noticed that I have already been writing for a little over 16 minutes now and it does even seem like it. It merely seems like I've been writing for about 5 minutes. If all the assignments were like this one, I bet pretty much every one would do good, cause its not hard to talk about what your thinking about at a particular time. You can just about write about anything you want, whether it is a event happening in your life or just something you feel like getting off your chest, all you have to to is merely just type it in and be able to get it off your chest and get a grade while doing it too. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     I havent really decided what to write about. so many things are going on in my head all the time it seems like I could write for a very long time. I do that though, I have a journal and its handy. I like to go back and read what I write and think to myself 'what an idiot'. its a learning experience really, and I hope more people use journaling to express themselves. Some people use online journals which at first I thought was odd because I write personal stuff in my journal. I wouldn't want the internet world to read all that. but then I started reading my friend's online journals and actually started one myself. Katie calls me a follower but she is a conforming nonconformist in that she claims she's not starting one because everyone else has done so and she'd like to be different. That reminds me of George, he is the classic conforming nonconformist. he hates anything anyone likes and loves anything anyone hates. especially lauren. their relationship is odd in that way. George makes a point of emphatically disliking something just to spite the rest of us. he is an interesting person to study. I am always observant but observing him is just interesting. he's like a girl and I swear he has PMS. we went on a trip to kentucky this summer and he decided he didn't want to go to the lake with the rest of the group (david and I didn't want to either) so the three of us stayed in the condo and played golf actually. but then the next day, he still didn't want to go and he made a big scene about it and then got all huffy when we Couldn't decide on a thing to do when it started raining and the lake was deemed a bad idea. he just left. he drove off in one of the two cars we had and was gone for a long time. the funny thing about chris is that he wants you to think he's cool. so he'll do and say things to seem cool and crazy. he went to a grocery store and was talking to some local teenagers and claims he was invited to go hang out with them that night. I don't know if I belive him but I really don't care. the point is that later he claimed that he 'might' go hang out with them like he was mr. popular. of course he wasn't really and the way to deal with him in his pouty state is to ignore him or somehow let him know that you don't care. He is such a confusing boy. I mean, they're all confusing but he takes the cake. having liked him before, I knew what I was getting into the last time. and the time before that. his biggest relationship flaw is that he is so flaky! so now I feel bad like I'm just judging everyone I know. grr. that's a noise I make, I make many of them. I make many faces too. at work john laughs at me because I can't control my expressions. especially if someone says something dumb. I just can't hold it in. my moms the same way. I wonder if that's learned or inherited. anyway. speaking of mom, my parents moved to florida in feb. and march. it was ok at first because I was of the opinion that I was getting an apartment so I wouldn't be living with them and wouldn't see them much anyway. but man I was wrong. I visited them in may and felt unusually emotionally detached. while I was there dad did the same annoying things he's always done, not listening, asking questions I'd just asked etc. drove me nuts. but now I miss them a lot. I was listening to Avril Lavigne and she has a song called nobodys home. and I realized that I have no where else to go. this apartment is my home now and man that's depressing. the kitchen is dirty, the floors are dirty, we need to steam clean, lauren and katie are bums and it took them 4 days to clean out MY cooler from saturday which now reeks because they left food in there to soak. people would call this bitterness. I like to claim that at least I'm expressing an emotion instead of keeping it all inside like I tend to do. I took one of those personality surveys online the other night because neal showed me the website. it said I was an ESTP? I think. anyway, part of it said that I would tell people what I think. I don't know how correct that is because I am usually the person with enough tact to not say mean things and well pretty much ALL my friends will say crap. Jill is the most tactless, when she and sean got together I was quite angry. and still when I think about it I get angry at her. why not at him? I don't get that. but when I typed his name I accidentally wrote sew. I am thinking about buying myself a sewing machine because I keep thinking of things. like today as I walked across campus I was thinking of different shirts and 'textiles' to make. I've wanted to do stuff like that for a while but I just. didn't. and now, even though I'm busy with papers to write etc, I really want to get creative. Lauren's sewing machine is here still but it didn't work very well. I can't remember how badly it ran but I should probably check that before I buy one. I don't know how much they'll cost either. I think $150 at walmart? but I don't want a plastic one. I'm sure I could break it and I'd rather have machinery than plastic. I think I should inheirit mom's old one and she can get a new one. but I said that once and she said no way. whatev. I'm tired. I tried to go to bed by midnight again but it ended up to be 130 I think. I don't remember exactly but 6 or less hours of sleep sucks. and I've been doing it for days. that's probably not good. another thing that's probably no bueno is that I HATE my job. and this isn't like the first year I worked at culvers and I was just a lazy bum. I am good at my job, I do it well, I used to enjoy serving customers. but now it has  been REALLY hard to make myself go. and its not like I'm just going to call in sick, I just don't want to go. I want to hit almost all of my coworkers, the guys that hit on me and our dumb new manager. I don't get why he thinks he can change everything right when he gets here without learning how the business works in the first place! and he's weirdly energetic. and since lauren and david have told me the same, I know I'm not the only one whos creeped out by it. well goodbye my 20 min were up a few sentences ago. "
Tell me about yourself.," Hi. My name is Shanique Annette Roberson. Usually when I have to write something I like to introduce myself first. I did not prewrite this I promise. I was born November 27, 1985 (the day before Thanksgiving). I am now 18 years old and am excited about being in the college of engineering at the University of Texas at Austin as a Biomedical engineering major. I love to play sports (volleyball, softball, and track), write poetry, praise dance! and enjoy nature. Some things that I would like to do before I leave Austin or before I graduate college are to go horseback riding again (preferably, to take horseback riding lessons), to go kyacking ( I don't have a clue right now as to how to spell this word), to go parasailing with a friend of mine and to visit the capitol and some of the musuems in the city. I would also like to get involved in a good service organization. I love service and helping other people. Oh!  About my family. I am the daughter of Lee and Nancy Roberson of Bay City, TX. I have one older sister, Joyce Evette Roberson. My father works for a nuclear plant, my mother is a teachers aide, and my sister is in the U. S. Navy. She (my sister) has been overseas twice (yes, to Iraq as well--she said that where she was wasn't that bad at all). She has now been restationed to florida. This makes me really nervous sometimes because we are predicted to have a pretty bad hurricane season this year and many of them hit florida. She picked a bad state to go to. Anyway, I told my sister that she could go wherever she wanted as long as I could come and visit at least once (ha! Like I could really decide where she would go. I just thought I'd try it). She would have flown me to Iraq to go see the sites and to go see the pyramids in Egypt but my mom wouldn't let me go. She didn't want the both of us over there. However, I plan to go visit in Florida either during Christmas break or Spring Break. My thoughts have now shifted to the Wells family. This is a family or couple that I meet on a plane my eighth grade summer. I had gone to National Baptist Conference in Florida and was flying back to houston by myself. They told my god-mother, who was with me before the flight, that they would keep an eye on me. When we got to houston we exchanged info and said we would keep in touch. Now, usually when this happens, people don't really keep in touch but in this case we have kept in touch for over 4 years now. We send each other cards, call each other and all that good stuff. I think that that is just amazing. What esle to talk about???? OK I am just getting words now. (Friends, other homework, love,Oh) Let me tell you about the home I would like. I was raised in a somewhat country area and I came seem to get awat from that. I would like to build a big country house with a large bay area window, sunlight roof in the kitchen or some area of the house, maybe a lake, and I know that I want horses, dogs, and cats. I don't know why but this picture always comes into my head when I think of what I want my future home to look like. Also I have to have a porch that goes all the way around with at least one swing on it and most definitely atleast one walk in closet. I don't know exactly where I would like this house but I think I would like it to be somewhere in TX. Time is almost up and this is about all that I can think of right now anyway so bye and I will see you next time. The one and only.   "
Tell me about yourself.,"     I really do not feel homesick at the moment. Today a lot of my sorority sisters were feeling so sad because they miss their families and everything at home. In a way I do feel like I miss my mom and my dogs and Dallas in general but I am having too much fun in Austin. More and more parties and events filled my calender as the week progressed and eventually I just got sick. Literally. I felt like I was spinning in bright lights and feeling more and more nauseated by the second. As soon as I started feeling that way, I realized the true comfort of home that I do miss a lot. Today I ended up waiting at the health center for two hours by myself and I really wanted my mom to be sitting there. I felt really independent which I liked, but I also felt lost. I had no support and I feel like it will be hard to not feel so sick with out my mom.        On another note, I am getting scared about this whole freshman fifteen thing. I am eating cereal at the moment and it is ten o'clock at night. It seems crazy to me. Hopefully all of the walking to class will clear off the extra pounds. I feel so terrible right now. I am so thirsty and my mouth is super dry. The doctor told me that my lymph nodes are swollen which scared me because they feel like they are going ot explode. My room mate will not stop humming and it annoys me as I write this. And all of her online music is driving me up the wall. It is getting so hard to concentrate on this paper. I am about to start getting ready for bed also because I am super tired. I really don't want to go to my 8 30 class in the morning. Do you know how early that is?  I am not looking forward to it. I hope the class is fun. It is about fashion design which interests me but I heard it is really hard and has a lot of projects. I finally got water. I am so excited. I really like the way my room is decorated. It is all pink and orange accessories and it is super cute. Ow. It really hurts to drink this water because of my nodes. Ouch. The doctor told me to inform her in case of that but I had not had a problem really. My forehead itches. I feel like I am complaining a lot as I am nonstop writing but I guess it has just been a really rough day. I really love UT though, I am having such a great time. It makes me laugh that you will probably not be reading this until I am on my deathbed. That will be funny. I bet this writing is really bad but I am just following the rules. This constant humming is really annoying me now. I have already told her to stop once but she keeps on humming. Oh well, I can not let it annoy me because we are best friends and room mates and all. This is going ot be an  awesome year. I can not wait till the time gets rolling. I really feel like brushing my teeth. I can still taste my Frosted Flakes. Gross. I have to remember to take all of my medicines for the night. I always forget little but important things like that. I also felt like putting on a facial mask to help my skin out. My skin seems to be really sensitive to weather and location changes. It kind of weird like that. Well my time is almost up. I feel like even though I am thinking about things, I can not really decifer what I am hearing inside my head. It is kind of weird. My room mate is staring at me trying to make me laugh, but the good student I am, I am trying to resist laughing. Well, I am about to go to sleep and my time is almost up so good night. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     No what do I write about?I'm typing in a computer lab,and I'm surprised there are only a few people in here. It is cold in this computer lab. It has gotten a lot colder in the past few days. I have a quiz in chemistry and I need to study. My roommate must be wondering where I am. Its really different in college. I have a meeting at   7 tongiht, I need to study for my quiz. THere is a bunch of paper next to my desk, I wonder who left it. The girl next to me is typing a paper, and another girl just walked in the computer lab. She is wearing a red shirt. I need to eat before the cafeteria closes. It closes really early. The computer next to me keeps turning on and off by itself. Someone else walked into the computer lab. He is wearing a blue shirt and jeans. The screen of the computer to my right is green. The room is starting to feel colder. I need to get my jacket. There are noises outside the lab, it sounds like a bunch of girls. I just submitted my math homework and made a 100. I wonder  if I misspelled any words in this. I am feeling overwhelmed as I think about all the quizzes I have thursday and friday, and I still haven't gotten my calculus book. I started to feel sick today, maybe because of the change in weather. I need to get some sleep. This room is really quiet. I see people walking outside of the computer lab. I wish I could go home this weekend. I kind of miss my family, but it is nice here too. I really like my apartment, I need to wash dishes. Someone left the computer lab and knocked something over. Someone walked in with a green shirt. I wonder how to drop this yoga class I was put in. Maybe I could stay in it. It might be easy. I feel really stressed about school, I hope I can get a 4. 0, I really like my biology and chemistry and psychology classes,they are interesting. Only 5 more minutes. I need to run tonight. Its getting darker outside. Its almost 6. THe cafeteria closes at 7:30. I'm feeling tired, but I have so many things to do. and I need to get some medicine. I wonder what my roommates doing, probably watching tv. Real Worlds on tonight. I wonder what my quiz will be like tomorrow. I hear people talking outside. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     I always have a million thoughts going on in my head but now that I am asked to write about them, I can't. I wonder where the printers are. its already 7:40. its so quiet in here. I wonder if this girl next to me knows where to print. it looks like she's buisy. this keyboard is dirty, the keys are hard to press. I shouldn't have thrown away my smoothie. its so dull in here. its already getting dark. I hope I'm spelling okay. I can't wait until tomorrow. ""and I love you, and its more then I ever knew. "" (I'm singing in my head). its too quiet, like we're not allowed to talk, its kind of depressing. I'm so glad I learned to type. I hope I can download my calculus homework on this computer. I hope I understand it. this weekend I go home. but the best part is going to be the six hour drive with my boyfriend. he's great. and I love him more everyday. I hope this feeling lasts. I would love to marry him, in like 6 years. he's great and we're great together, I miss him. I just saw him yesterday but I miss him. I'm hungry. I think ill take dinner up to my room and socialize with my roommate. I wonder what I'm going to eat today. I had a sandwhich yesterday. I should eat something hot. hmm. I guess I could have chicken strips. or vegetables. oo, and a salad. is that how you spell oo. oh, eww, uh, oo. ? oh well. now its 7:48. I wonder if I need glasses? this watch is bothering me. ah, there. my foot hurts so much. I wonder when the swelling will go down. I should email my dad. I hope my string doesn't come off. I forgot to put my rings back on. I hope I don't lose them. tomorrow I have an easy day, and I get to see fili. yah. yeh. ya. whatever. my head hurts. I should eat. what did I eat today. cereal. soup. hmm. I should eat dinner after this. I have so much reading to do. but its labor day weekend, so ill do a little bit each day and then finish this weekend. wow, my time is almost up. I hope I'm doing this right. hmm. I think so. I wish I could gain weight, well in certain places more then others. now someone else is sitting next to me. hmm. its so weird how there are so many oriental students here, its almost as if they are the majority. but that can't be right. it must just seem that way. there are so many people and I don't know any of them. someones chair keeps squeaking. oh, I need to sign up for those informal classes. what is that ringing. I don't think cell phones are allowed in here. I need to write a letter to danny. I wonder if hanna plays this weekend. I know they do. but where? hmm I need to find out, but soon. I wonder if I should tell my parents about me going home this weekend or just surprise them. I don't know which one is better or worse. oh well. that chair squeaked again. I don't see any printers. hmm. I should stop looking around, people are looking at me funny. its almost eight. I need to read. I wonder if the timer goes past twenty minutes or if it keeps going. well that answers my question. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     Ok. just got done crying because of stupid high school people I never want to talk to again. The shaking of my hands is making this a little harder to do than normal. I hope I don't misspell too many things. I am sniffingly so loud. I should go get a tissue. I never did learn how to type right on this thing. Why did my thoughts just totally flip?  Wow, that's weird. Brain is slowly losing it's ability to function properly after the realization of how bad my mind jumps topics. I really wish I could concentrate for more than 2 seconds when I'm emotional. It really sucks to cry and have to put everything else off until I can see straight. But I won't be crying any more hopefully as I am cutting off those jerks from high school. I don't need than, nor do I wan them in any aspect of my life. They just make things complicated because they are sick and deranged people with nothing better to do than mess with me. Wow, London tell them how you really feel!  I hate computers when I have fake nails. I always hit a random button and end up typing a couple of lines up in a sentence that is already done. My back hurts really bad from sitting up on the ground. I think it's time to switch positions. Ah. Much better. Now my typing skills really stink. It's really hard to lay on the ground and type. Oh I have a laptop. That would be stupid to do if I had a regular PC. I still can't get comfortable. The floor isn't exactly rock hard, but it's no fluffy bed. That's better. I don't know why I didn't get on the bed in the first place. AHHH!!  Yes, I do I don't want to be on my white comforter!!  Oh no!!  You know writing this is turning out to be a lot harder than it should be. You would think that all this movement would not have to happen, but not with me. Stupid back gives me problems all the time. I miss Dr. Jones!!  I don't know how I'm going to make it not going to get adjusted whenever I hurt. It just occurred to me that I might be using AIM abbreviations in this writing thing. That might not make me look too smart. Oh, well. I don't want to go back and look at it. It would just take to long. God, my nose is still stopped up. My skin is drying out to. I need to wash my face and moisturize. I forgot how to spell moisturize!!!  I had to retypr it like three times. You know for someone who is supposed to be smart, I am pretty dumb sometimes. I wonder if Pennebaker thought I was dumb in class today. I zoned out a little bit and then raised my hand and said something that did not fit with what he was looking for. I wish I could just leave all the bad behind me, then maybe I could pay attention in class. But no. I have to be all sensitive and worry about everyone and everything that someone else should be caring about. I seriously need to just be tough and tell people to back off me. I was going to use a bad word, but I don't know if that would be appropriate. I wonder if it would affect my grade if I did write a cuss word. Is that how you spell cuss?  Maybe I should have just wrote curse. And why do I always have to fix the word just?  Every time I type just without paying close attention I put an extra j in between the u and the s. It makes me feel quite stupid. Time just ran out. I'm glad because I want to just go to sleep and forget about people  I will never have to see again. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     Well, I woke up this morning scared because I was dreaming! I think I was dreaming that I was being chased by somebody and I was running like hell!  My roommate Kate woke me up because we were a little bit late to school and I jumped out of bed like I was on fire! I scared her just getting out of bed!! hahahaha! It was pretty funny, I guess!! Wow, it is a BEAUTIFUL day outside!  It's all cloudy and I hope it rains all weekend. The news said it would but I really hope they are right!! So, there's this guy that just got up and left. He looked maybe familiar but maybe not! He was wearing a red shirt and he looked kind of silly! Hahahahaha!!  Now this other girl just sat down to use the computer and she looks a little bit irritated!  I might be wrong but she's hitting the keys like she wants to kill!! I don't know. maybe she just type's hard. or something!! OH Yeah!  I had a good time in my math class today. I actually learned something!! It was pretty cool! You know, I come from a really tiny place outside of El Paso called Fabens. This place is huge for me!! It's like this whole library is the size of my town. All the people in it too. My town is tiny and there are a thousand people here!!! It's so crazy to come from a town that the population is the size of a full library! That's tiny compared to this place!  Along with all this walking in and out, I've never seen so many people get together at once and if I have, it was at my 600 student high school!! These 600 students were all four grades put together!  That makes me laugh because I feel like an ant here!! But that's ok. I will grow to be a big UT Longhorn!! Woo! Hoo!!  So,  I miss my little sister. She's 9 years old and I was like her second mommy. My older sister attends UT and she's been here for a while now! Back at home, It was only both my parents and my little sister and I !  When my parents went out I would have to take care of her and I practically did that all nine years of her life. practically!!! haahhahaha!! We all went out a lot so we left her with my grandmother or my aunt at times!! She was who I always came home to to play with!! She always wanted me to play with her and most of the time I did!! I would try to take her to all of my games in sports and all of my track meets!  She really loved to see me play!! She always wanted to play with my team and after every game . ""Cyndi, When I grow up, I'm going to play Basketball too, or volleyball and I'm also going to run track and throw the discus. Just like you!"" Awwww. My baby wants to be just like me!! I think she's the one I miss the most because I grew up with her and she grew up with me!! WoW! She's so big now!! I can still remember when she was just a little baby!! Awww. my little baby! Oh yeah. and her name is Joyce Lynn just in case you wanted to know!  She's a very smart girl and I can't wait until she grows up!! She already knows what she wants to be. a Marine Biologist!! Can you believe it?!! She told me that!!! :-) "
Tell me about yourself.,"I am watching t. v. and waiting for my friends to get here from out of town. which I don't even know if they are going to show up because they are taking a really long time. I like that movie 50 first dates. I said that because I'm watching t. v. oh I already said that. well any way I am just so bored trying to finish my homework before tommorow just so I won't have a lot to do during the week. I'm waiting for my boyfriend to come home also, but he'll be here on friday. I wish he wasn't in san antonio right now. it always seems like gets down when he visits san antonio. and now he's at the hospital because his cousin stopped breathing. I pray to God that she's. I had one of those pop ups come up because I am on my slow, old computer. I watching the monk. I love the monk because it's mysteries. and the monk always has some cool way to figure out the murders. it's a marathon and I'm starting to get tired of watching it. I hope that venus williams wins in her tennis match today. that will shut some of those people that are saying rude things about her father up. I like both of the sisters but venus hasn't won in a long time so I think it's her turn to take the crown. I am almost half way through this writing assignment. I keep reminding myself that I need to take a look at the experiments so I can sign up for them. I forget how many hours I need. Oh I just looked at the paper, it says 5 hours. I don't know what to write because I haven't been involved in a lot of interesting activities. I wish my friends lived in austin then I wouldn't have to rely so much on seeing derrick. I hope this isn't the same monk, it is so I need to change the channel. I don't know what to watch we got this digital cable but it repeats the channels over and over. Derrick is going to have to give them a call and let them know that. I hope that wasn't intented. man, there is nothing to watch on labor day. I hope I got my class code right because I didn't write it down. that wasn't very smart. now I'm watching the source awards from two years ago on BET. I got to find something a little better to watch. I just changed to what not to wear. I think this show is nice because it makes people over to look so nice. that would be nice in a way if someone did that to me, but then I would be affended that people don't like the way I dress. I have always wanted to be a model, but as they say it takes money to make money. I have this filling that I might win the lottery but I guess everyone has that feeling. I love to talk about what I would do if I won the lottery. I would certainly give my mother a good sum of money and also my step dad. I would give my father enough so that he could retire from the army and not have to work anymore. I would also give my boyfriend a good sum of money because          "
Tell me about yourself.,"     Stream on consciousness, this is something I have done before, when I was writing my diary, I though it'd be a cool idea, I wrote down a lot of stuff, some having to do with music, some having to do with my boyfriend. He's a good guy, I miss him sometimes, well I do but I don't- it's not really an active missing, it's a passive missing, like I know I do somehwhere in my heart, but it doesn't hurt or anything I wonder what that could mean? everyone always asks me how long we'll last, and even though I'm not sure, I guess well last a long time, I mean its already been a year, which really doesn't seems so long anymore, only a few weeks maybe, until I really think about it. then its much longer. even though it all doesn't add up at first- it makes sense somhow. you know? it all makes sense when you look back at it all. I tend to think in really long streams and then my mind pauses, as if to switch subjects, not really to- well actually sometimes, to reflect on it- but I always inevitably move on, I wonder if that's what veryone's like. if they all reflect on their thoughts like I do, then move on. or if they thing continuosly only shifting smoothly from one thought to the next. there has to be someone like that, somewhere. maybe in china or some other country, but some where. I refuse to think that people all think the same, not only because people are inherently different but because even if 99% of us wer the same, there would have to be at least one person who's not. That's just the way I think. Ellipses are fun, they provide space, and soetimes a depth that no other literary device can reach. I'm not sure if depth is the right word of if tis truly a literary device, but ellipses are (thoughts search for word) something that people use. Woah, a mental stumble in words, I wonder how oftne I do that? I don't think I realize when taht happens, that reminds me of foreign languages- I like foreign languages. rightnow I'm taking dutch- but spanish is the one I'm most versed in. I think in spanish sometimes, its kind of fun, and I have always found it interesting that someone could actually think in another language then they'er own. I used to think when I was a little kid that that would be impossible- then I though itd be incredible, now that I can do taht it just seems like fun, I like it, it feels. Comforting somehow. I'm not sure why. it must be because my goal is to be fluent in as many languages as possible- though I'll probably do only four or five- someone in my class has a father that knows seven. I find hat amazing, it's simply amazing what the mind is capable of. Medicine is fascinationg to me, not just the cure type, but the physiological aspect of the human boday, and the relation so the psychological part of the human body, has always fascinated me, even when I was younger. I suppose I've always had a fascination with biology and the like and that is what has led me to this point in my life. its like my whole life up to this point has guided me to this exact path, and in a way, to this exact moment in time. perhaps only to point me in another direction. (looks up at light) not all the lights in this library are lit, I wonder why. maybe its because it would be too bright, or maybe because the sun is still out, or maybe some of them burnt out. I wonder if there's a pattern. (searches for pattern) no, there doesn't appear to be a pattern. not lit. lit lit lit lit lit lit not lit not lit lit all the way down the row, lit lit lit lit partially lit not lit lit lit lit lit all the way down the row (lost her place) ah well. worth a shot. I search for patterns in things a lot- very scientific like. that one police officer told me I sounded like a doctor. he asked me what I was going to ut to be and I said I was going to major in biology and become a doctor and he said ""You sound like a doctor, in the way you tlak"" I though that was kind of weird at first, but very logical. I am analytical by nature and tend to use larger words than many people, though they are not always right in my head- when I say them they come out right, and not only that but I love biology, and finding out what makes us tick, and wen I'm in an argument I try to see all the sides- and to see what's underneath it all. for instance I try to see what the ohr person is saying and why. what makes them say that. why they say it the way they do- I'm going to like this class- I like psychology. psych= mind. ology= the study of. I was in medical terminology. actually the class was called health science tech, but the main part was about medical terminology and working in the clinical setting, I worked at the hospital but instead of money I got grades, particiapation grades reall. it was fun, even the parts most would consider gross. I enjoyed it- but I don't think I want to be one of thos doctors tthat work in the hospital. I think my typingg is louder than everyone else in this library, the keys aren't the easiest to push. they stick a little, on some letters more than others. they're like keyboard keys that get stuck because you were careless and spilled soda on them, but a little looser. they're not quite tahat stick at all. but still they seem so loud. The guy outside in orange is drinking coffee- I like orange soda. its my favorite color and soda, good stuff. I wonder how much time people spend observing things outside their little bubble. if people had a bubble of consciousnes, it would be their immediate surroundings. just basically what they can touch, or what they can comfortably read. I wonder how many people ake time to see beyond that and what they're like. what type f people they are, if people really do have type. basically, what they're like inside. ar they analytical, whimsical, forward thinking? are they lacadaisical? what are they like? am I really one of them? I kind of think I might be or maybe one that is in between that and the other. maybe I'm right in the middle of two extremes like fire and ice, heaven and hell, earth and water. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     The speakers that are connected to my computer are extremely cheap. I only purchased them because there was a $15 mail-in rebate with them. It would be really nice to have a new computer, this one is old and outdated and the internet connection is really slow. I am tired of always having to listen to my brother and his girlfriend bicker and yell at each other, they are like two little kids every waking hour I'm with them they are constantly harassing each other. My computer monitor is really small. It makes looking at my screen for extended periods of time like this hurt my eyes. College life is really not what I expected. I'm constantly feeling homesick and want to go back to Houston. I guess I just need to get acclimated to Austin and college life once I do I'm sure I will enjoy it very much but until then I will attempt to go back to Houston as much as possible. Luckily a lot of my friends also attend UT, they are definitely making the transition more bearable. Every one of my classes has over 100 people in them. This is a big change from my 20 people honors classes in high school. It doesn't really allow me to make relationships with my professors. Raquetball was really fun. I ran smack into the wall with my shoulder and it still hurts but its a good pain one of those pains that reminds you that you accomplished something fun and physically strenuous. Yeah I don't think I spelled that word correctly. I'll have to look it up in the dictionary when I am done. Is this assignment done yet? No still 13 and a half minutes to go. This is the first time I've ever written a stream of consciousness. I know there is some famous novel or documentary our there where there is like a 17 page stream of consciousness containing only a single sentence. I think its title has the world Ullyses or it is written by a Ullyses or something. I know this because my father appraised me of it. Just useless trivia I guess. I enjoy watching trivia games on TV, mainly stuff like Who Wants to be a Millionaire or Jeopardy. But maybe that's just because normally there isn't anything else on. The World Series of Poker is enjoyable to watch as well. I was initially really sceptical about writing this stream of consciousness because I didn't really know how it would turn out or how easy it would be to write, but now that I'm half way through it things are just sort appearing on the page. Definitely not what I expected. I have to say this is the most interesting writing assignment I think I have ever had. Whew only 8 minutes to go. The printer next to me is running out of ink, which means it will have to be replaced pretty soon which means more money out of my pocket. You have to be thrifty in college that's for sure. My budget is $500 a month and this month alone I have already spent over 800. I sure am glad that I received financial aid to make the burden of paying for college easier on my parents. They were sure proud of me when I told them about the scholarships I received. It felt good to make them proud. My brother is smart and does extremely well in school, I hope I can live up to my parents standards and continue to do well educationally in college. College sure is much different from high school. A lot more studying and my studying skills aren't nearly up to par considering I almost never did it high school. Now I know I need to study to do well in school so I am, but it just takes me forever to outline a chapter. A lot longer than it seems like it really should. I guess maybe I'm a little bit too stressed out about college. I'm sure that once I get used to it, it will be one of the best experiences of my life. But until then, it's still hell. My friends are in the living room, I told them before I started writing this not to disturb me for 30 minutes, but who knows if they will obey me. My one friend John loves to just barge into my room. I played raquetball with John and Joseph. I suck at raquetball but hey it's only my 3rd or 4th time to play it. None of us are really are that good. The lie detector test in Psychology class last time was cool. My hands normally get really sweaty so I'm sure I would have sent that sweat-o-meter off the charts, I wonder why my hands are sweaty a lot. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     Well I guess I will just write about my college life or what has been of it so far. Well I guess the bad news for today was that I think I failed my first Astronomy Quiz maybe I should of studied more maybe I should have paid more attention in class who knows?? But hey they drop the lowest quiz grade. Life has been very stressful lately with starting a new job and just trying to make time for everything its almost impossilbe. I mean there is just so much to do read for classes, study, but still have time to hang out with your friends. At the time the people I am most hanging out with are those from my home town. Good old Del Rio Texas the land of amistad I don't know if I was suppose to make a lot of new friends but for the moment they are the one I have most been hanging out with I mean I have grown up with them and they know me !  I guess I just feel comfortable around them because we have a lot of things in common and besides when ever I need I ride home they are there. My roommate is also from Del Rio the town where everyone knows everyone most of my family lives there and well looking back a lot of high school drama goes on. Everyone in High School always has something to say about everyone else I mean its terrible its hard to believe I was in all that drama as well. Yeah well my roommate is my best friend and well you know living together is much more diffrent than just seeing each other everyday at school but hey we are hanging in there no major fights or anything, you learn to adapt. Since she doesn't have as much reading to do as I do I just learn to go to the Study Lounge and well I don't mind all that much it makes me study since there is nothing else to do there. But well back to my life in college. I started my job yesterday and its lots of fun just because you don't really do much and well you get paid for it. Its like the people in the office are looking for things to make me do so today I was shreding paper. Then well I was suppose to go to this free pizza and bowling for the TIP. This program I'm in that is suppose to create a small school enviroment in this big school and well when me and my friend Monica showed up they had eaten all the food so well that went that idea, we just ended up eating at Wendy's. Its funny how you seem to cling on to those you know rather than meet new people I mean me and Monice didn't quite get along in High School but now its just kind of we put up with each other just to have someone there she has 2 classes with me and well none of my other friends yeah the phone rang so I lost my train of thought and well now my roommate came in. So yeah where was I yeah about people from my town. I miss my parents and well I guess the town I little bit. When I was there it was fun the first couple of 15 years and then you get into high school and well pretty much all you want to do is leave there is only so much you can do and well crossing the border and getting drunk it not on my top list of great things to do like it was some of my fellow classmates. But my parents are very special people to me and so is my boyfriend, I don't know they always seem to understand me no matter what mood I may be in or anything like that, I guess we all turn into terrible people sometimes, but not on purpose. My mom is like the most loving person and well so is my dad I have just always considered myself to be lucky to have such great people like them as my parents so understanding and just giving. Giving to other people giving of advice and well just anything they have to give. The time has gone pretty fast in this thing at first I thought it would go by slow but no it has gone pretty fast. And so to continue with my day I walked back to my dorm alone from the Union and well sometimes its good to be alone and well the school looks so much more peaceful when there are not a lot of people trying to get to class and well the way back from somewhere is always so much faster and shorter than when you are walking to get on time and you just get frustrated because the sidewalk just gets longer. "
Tell me about yourself.,"well I am sitting here in my bed just before 11 AM on a thursday morning writing out a  conscious stream of my thoughts. my girlfriend is coming to see me this weekend and I'm  excited about that, as well as the fact that my best friend is going back home for the weekend  and leaving his apartemnt at my disposal. an apartment is a much better place to stay with  your girlfriend than any god-forsaken dormatory, especially since my room mate will be here. football game saturday agains UNT, and I love my football. I've always loved college football  and now that I get to go and watch my team, one of the best in the nation, play is a great  experience for me, on that I will enjoy greatly for the next few years. speaking of which, I'm  pretty hacked off that I was unaware that you had to purchase tickets to the OU game  seperately, and more than that, that there was no obvious information on the season ticket  website about this. I'm getting back into the flow of school again, and most of my classes seem  like they will be rather easy, assuming that I read the material and pay attention in class, which I  might add is tough to do on a regular basis. I've havent attended a single calculus study  session which greatly frees up my tuesdays and thursdays, having only one class in the late  afternoon. I love not having to write with proper punctuation and capitalization. the  experiment in class the other day was very interesting. I personally though lie detectors were a  bunch of crap, but the psychological side of them is pretty interesting. I wouldn't mind doing a  psychological study of poker players and how they interact while playing hold 'them, etc. Some of  the calls they make about other peoples hands are simply amazing. what makes someone fold  a good hand?  what makes a person be able to win on a bluff?  these are interesting events to  me. but anyways, I wish I didn't have any homework this weekend, as a matter of fact I need to  finish reading chapter three in my psyc book, I'll attend to that after I finish writing this. hmmmm, what else, oh yeah. last night I played with four of my friends in a pick up game at  the gym. the first game we won, the second game we won, and the third game we lost by one  shot to a team led by a steriod, testosterone-over pumped crazy kid who was a complete jerk. it's interesting that everyone on my team was pissed off, except for me. they are normally the  ones who tell me to chill out cause I get mad and stuff. I sort of miss dallas and my girl, but I  know that we're both very committed and that she loves me a lot. she's a great girl and I'd hate  to have to do all this without her, although I wish she was at TSU, that would make things  much, much easier. I'm really hungry, I wish this timer would hurry up, I need to shave, wash  my face, brush my teeth, eat something, finish reading, do some homework, and study for a  quiz I have tomorrow in economics. I hope that quiz won't be too hard. I'll just have to  memorize the stuff in the book such as the expendeture approach to GDP, which is that  GDP=C+I+G+(I'M-EX). wow, I'm really glad I can remember that and I havent even studied yet,  but the income approach is a little harder, even though I know I can get that easily if I just study  it for a little while. will thanks for the time, my 20 are up. bye. "
Tell me about yourself.,"     I'm home. wanted to go to bed but remembered that I had a psychology homework to complete by sometime during next week. Maybe this wouldn't take that long. I can handle this. Something is making a noise in the restroom. Did I turn on the fan? I got to write more. This is harder than I thought. I'm not thinking anything. Was I always like this when I didn't have anything to do? Should I go to bed after finishing this assignment or should I stay awake. I think I had an appointment with someone. Or maybe it was some kind of meeting, that was not mandatory to participate in. Is there any assignments besides this. My roommate took my digital camera yesterday, but it's right beside me, now. Wonder what he did with it. I'll ask him when he comes back. My eyes hurt. I should really do something about my glasses. When should I go fix it. ? Feel tired. I should really go to bed. Only 9 minutes passed. Half way done. Wonder if I can just stop here. Maybe not. Hm. let's see. What am I thinking? Wow my feet are covered with dirt. Amazing I didn't notice that until now. How did I get this on my legs? I want to wash it off but I'll wait until this assignment is over. 8 minutes to go. What are my parents doing anyway? Hope they're doing fine. When would they be able to receive the email I sent few minutes ago. Anyways, I feel like I really had to finish something today but can't remember what it was. Guess I'll figure it out after taking a nap. Am I still not there. Never knew how long a 20 minute could be. Thirsty. No water around. Now I'm curious what the purpose of this assignment is and what kind of point professor is trying to make. Time is almost up. "

        "Here's a detailed approach for creating a database-friendly structure for your personality trait modeling results:\n\n  1. Database Schema Design\n\n  Core Tables:\n  - Experiments: Primary table with unique experiment_id, timestamp, model_version, and configuration parameters\n  - Traits: Hierarchical structure with parent_trait_id for relating specific traits to broader categories\n  - Conditions: Test conditions including steering direction, quantization level, and activation layer\n  - Results: Measurement outcomes linked to experiments with standardized metrics\n  - Prompts: Repository of test prompts used across experiments with metadata\n\n  Relationships:\n  - One-to-many relationship between experiments and results\n  - Many-to-many between traits and experiments\n  - Reference tables for test types, measurement methods, and model configurations\n\n  2. Structured Output Format\n\n  JSON Structure Example:\n  {\n    \"experiment_id\": \"uuid-string\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"ISO-datetime\",\n    \"model\": {\n      \"name\": \"llama-3.2-3b\",\n      \"quantization\": \"4bit\",\n      \"activation_layers\": [12, 15, 18]\n    },\n    \"trait\": {\n      \"domain\": \"personality\",\n      \"category\": \"big_five\",\n      \"name\": \"agreeableness\",\n      \"specificity\": \"broad\",\n      \"facet\": \"a1_trust\",\n      \"direction\": \"max\"\n    },\n    \"steering_vector\": {\n      \"method\": \"conceptor\",\n      \"path\": \"/results/vectors/a1_trust_max_vector.pt\"\n    },\n    \"results\": [\n      {\n        \"prompt_id\": \"trust_scenario_1\",\n        \"original_response\": \"text...\",\n        \"steered_response\": \"text...\",\n        \"classifier_scores\": {\n          \"gpt4o_rating\": 0.85,\n          \"ipip_classifier\": 0.78\n        },\n        \"statistical_metrics\": {\n          \"trait_expression_delta\": 0.42,\n          \"confidence_interval\": [0.38, 0.46]\n        }\n      }\n    ],\n    \"metadata\": {\n      \"session\": \"batch-20250309\",\n      \"researcher\": \"your-name\",\n      \"notes\": \"Testing IPIP-NEO facet steerability\"\n    }\n  }\n\n  3. Implementation Approach\n\n  Code Structure Modifications:\n  1. Create a dedicated ResultsManager class to handle all output serialization\n  2. Implement a configuration file for database connection settings\n  3. Add structured logging throughout experiment pipeline\n  4. Create data models for each entity type (Experiment, Trait, Result)\n  5. Include validation to ensure consistent data types and required fields\n\n  Storage Options:\n  1. SQLite: Lightweight option for local research with relational structure\n  2. MongoDB: Flexible document store if your data structure evolves frequently\n  3. PostgreSQL: Robust relational database for complex queries across experiment dimensions\n  4. Parquet files: Column-oriented storage for efficient statistical analysis\n\n  4. Enhanced Measurement Framework\n\n  Standardized Metrics:\n  1. Trait expression scores (normalized 0-1 scale)\n  2. Confidence intervals for each measurement\n  3. Effect size calculations for steering interventions\n  4. Cosine similarity between steered and target vectors\n  5. Inter-rater reliability when using multiple classifiers\n\n  Meta-analysis Support:\n  1. Statistical power calculations\n  2. Cross-experiment correlation matrices\n  3. Dimensionality reduction for visualizing trait relationships\n  4. Regression models for predictive trait steerability\n\n  5. Integration with Existing Code\n\n  1. Modify the output handling in main_demo.py and main_demo_ipip_mod.py\n  2. Create database initialization scripts\n  3. Add transaction handling to ensure data integrity\n  4. Implement automated backup procedures\n  5. Add utilities for exporting to statistical analysis formats (R dataframes)\n\n  6. Analysis Workflow Enhancements\n\n  1. Create query templates for common statistical analyses\n  2. Build visualization pipelines that read directly from structured data\n  3. Implement cross-validation utilities for classifier reliability\n  4. Design incremental analysis capabilities to build on previous experiments\n  5.

Here's my diss plan:\n# Plan introduction\n\n*Please write a short account of the topic to add context to your hypotheses. Please keep this section up to 500 words, if you want  to use more space and organize your Plan and a pre-registration that can help you later write the Part II Project's Report you can use OSF, a tool that helps you organize a project, including pre-registrations. https://help.osf.io/article/158-create-a-preregistration*\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) act via a series of feed-forward layers that perform a weighted sum of inputs from the previous layer, and then pass this sum to an activation function to produce the final output to the subsequent layer. As activations act as the primary currency between layers in an LLM, interpreting and manipulating these activations is, in turn, highly promising for understanding and changing their behaviour. Previous literature has focused on the use of targeted prompting and instruction fine-tuning to modify the behaviour of LLMs for apparent psychological traits, such as personality or political attitudes. (Serapio-García et al., 2023) (Petrov et al., 2024) However, these methods have had mixed results, often failing to be sufficiently robust to different tests as well as LLMs having poorer understanding of latent traits compared to surface-level traits; for instance, a semantic relationship (through text collocation) between voting preference and age is likely present throughout a training dataset, whereas that between voting intention and personality is not (effect size notwithstanding).\n\nThis dissertation aims to address this via the use of activation engineering, a recently introduced method to steer LLM behaviour via modification of activations during a forward-pass (i.e., an instance of text generation). In its most basic form, this involves identifying a steering vector, which is the difference in model activation between a contrasting pair of prompts (e.g. “sensitive” and “resilient”), which then shifts activations at inference-time towards either the former or latter trait. (Turner et al., 2024) The planned implementation here will advance on this, using a “conceptor”-based methodology, which is expected to improve both steering accuracy and ease of combining traits via a non-additive approach which better represents the latent variables and their activation correlations. (Postmus and Abreu, 2024) \n\nThe three primary categories of traits to be investigated are moral attitudes, political attitudes and personality. These choices offer several benefits: The inclusion of a varying degree of world-reference (political attitudes are typically based on normative or descriptive beliefs on the world, rather than about the individual); the opportunity to compare steerability across domains as well as within domains; and decomposability, such as the use of IPIP-NEO subscales for personality. This will allow for assessment of changes in steering efficacy with increases in trait specificity. Whilst safety-relevant traits such as honesty and power-seeking have been previously tackled in the activation engineering literature (Zou et al., 2023), less research exists on activation engineering as a means of modifying LLM behaviour to align with the wide variety of traits humans exhibit. This study could not only aid the development of “silicon samples” in the social sciences, but also improve understanding of the precision of trait representation in LLMs as well as differences across domains of human identity.\n\n# Aims and specific hypotheses\n\n*Here, please state you aim as a general question or aim of the study, followed by the specific hypotheses. The Hypotheses should be specific enough that when writing how to test them in the next section you are able to describe the tests and methods you will use to confirm or reject the hypothesis.*\n\nThe overall aim of the study is to perform activation engineering on LLMs to observe changes in their behaviour relative to psychological traits relating to personality, political attitudes and moral attitudes - and hence use these to form an understanding of differences in trait steerability within and across said domains. \n\nAlthough there is significant uncertainty as to the overall effects of activation engineering on LLM trait-relevant behaviours, it is hypothesised that political and moral attitudes will exhibit higher steerability compared to personality traits. This is due to the previously identified poorer capabilities of LLMs to make links from latent traits, such as personality, to more “surface-level” traits, such as voting intention (Petrov et al., 2024), as well as a less clear association between particular traits and clusters of traits to sentences produced by an individual with that trait. \n\nFor instance, the fact that a liberal individual wrote a political text appears highly predictive of the content of the text, yet that a person high in conscientiousness wrote a particular text appears less so. This may partly be due to the domain-generality of personality, as well as the aforementioned inward, rather than outward, focus. Nonetheless, it is known that LLMs can exhibit robust representations of the latent dimensions of personality (Suh et al., 2024), so it is by no means necessary for this to be true.\n\nThe second hypothesis is that as the traits manipulated increase in specificity, they will become less steerable. This is expected because of the reduced “semantic space” they occupy in the model parameters, assuming they can be accurately contained within a larger trait construct. A corollary of this is that if, for instance, a model with lower and higher quantisation are compared (reducing precision of model weights and activations), higher quantisation is expected to show reduced steerability performance across the same trait. A possible exception to this is that if a particular trait is specified too abstractly, it may display relatively poor steering accuracy, while a smaller yet more specific trait could perform better. Nonetheless, steerability seems likely to decrease with trait specificity overall, assuming high-quality modelling.\n\n# Methods\n\n*In this section please take the opportunity to describe the data structure, the methods you will use to preprocess the data and which statistical tools you will use to test the specific hypotheses.* \n\nThe data structure will be the outputs generated by the LLM compared across steered and non-steered conditions, and quantised and non-quantised conditions.
